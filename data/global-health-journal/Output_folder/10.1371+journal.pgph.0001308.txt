<section> Abstract
 
<section> Fractional dosing of COVID-19 vaccines could accelerate vaccination rates in low-income
 countries. Dose-finding studies of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) suggest
 that a fractional dose induces comparable antibody responses to the full dose in people <55
 years. Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of a fractional dose regimen of the
 BNT162b2 vaccine. REDU-VAC is a participant-blinded, randomised, phase 4, non-inferior-
 ity study. Adults 18–55 years old, either previously infected or infection naïve, were ran-
 domly assigned to receive 20μg/20μg (fractional dose) or 30μg/30μg (full dose) of
 BNT162b2. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of SARS-CoV-2
 anti-RBD IgG titres at 28 days post second dose between the reduced and full dose regi-
 mens. The reduced dose was considered non-inferior to the full dose if the lower limit of the
 two-sided 95% CI of the GMR was >0.67. Primary analysis was done on the per-protocol
 population, including infection naïve participants only. 145 participants were enrolled and
 randomized, were mostly female (69.5%), of European origin (95%), with a mean age of
 40.4 years (SD 7.9). At 28 days post second dose, the geometric mean titre (GMT) of anti-
 RBD IgG of the reduced dose regimen (1,705 BAU/mL) was not non-inferior to the full dose
 regimen (2,387 BAU/mL), with a GMR of 0.714 (two-sided 95% CI 0.540–0.944). No serious
 adverse events occurred. While non-inferiority of the reduced dose regimen was not demon-
 strated, the anti-RBD IgG titre was only moderately lower than that of the full dose regimen
 and, importantly, still markedly higher than the reported antibody response to the licensed
 adenoviral vector vaccines. These data suggest that reduced doses of the BNT162b2

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Today, less than 22% of people in low-income countries (LIC) have been vaccinated against
 COVID-19 with at least one dose, compared to 72% in high-income countries [1]. Besides
 allowing the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and their subsequent spread around the
 world, this blatant inequity in global vaccine distribution is leaving hundreds of millions of
 people vulnerable to the deadly virus. According to the UN, vaccine inequity will further
 deepen inequality and have a lasting impact on socio-economic recovery in LIC [2].
 The lack of access to COVID-19 vaccines is partly due to a phenomenon called ‘vaccine
 nationalism’, wherein most vaccines are being reserved for wealthy countries, and vaccine-
 producing countries limit exports to make sure that their own population is vaccinated first.
 Another important factor is the cost. Under current pricing, LIC would have to increase health
 care expenditure by up to 50%, compared to less than 1% for high-income countries, to vacci-
 nate 70% of their population [3–5]. The WHO, Gavi and CEPI co-led program COVAX was
 set up to stimulate global equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Although this program has
 led to the donation of over 1 billion vaccine doses to LIC to date, more doses, better logistics,
 and much more political will are required to cover the needs of the Global South [6].
 Fractionating doses as a dose-sparing strategy might help speed up vaccination rates by
 effectively reducing the cost per dose and thereby increasing the number of available doses.
 Based on proven safety and immunogenicity, the World Health Organization (WHO) has rec-
 ommended fractional doses in the past during outbreaks of yellow fever, polio and meningo-
 coccal disease in case of vaccine shortages in resource-limited settings [7–10].
 In terms of fractional vaccine doses for COVID-19 however, data is mostly limited to dose-
 finding studies. In a phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults aged 18–55 years, humoral and cellular
 responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) were found to be
 very similar between the full dose of 30μg and fractional doses of 20μg and even 10μg [11]. For
 the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Spikevax, Moderna), a phase 2 trial showed comparable humoral
 responses (binding and neutralizing antibody titres) to a 50μg dose as compared to the full
 dose of 100μg [12]. As far as we know, there has only been one trial reporting on clinical effi-
 cacy of fractional dosing in a small number of subjects. This multicentre trial observed 67%-
 97% efficacy of protection against symptomatic COVID-19 in a sub-group of participants who
 were primed with a half dose and boosted with a full dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzev-
 ria, AstraZeneca) vaccine [13]. In a recent paper, Więcek et al. used modelling data by Khoury
 et al. to predict vaccine efficacy of fractional doses [14,15]. Compared to the 95% efficacy pro-
 vided by the full dose of 30μg, fractional doses of 10μg and 20μg of BNT162b2 are estimated
 still be 80–90% effective in adults below 55 years old. Together with the dose-sparing advan-
 tage, the possibly fewer side effects caused by lower dosing, as suggested by some clinical data,
 may help tip the balance in favour of implementing fractional dosing strategies [16,17].
 As more data is urgently needed to fill this knowledge gap and guide the potential use of
 fractional doses of mRNA vaccines, we conducted a randomised controlled trial to determine
 whether immune responses to a reduced dose of BNT162b2 (20μg) are non-inferior to the full, 
<section> licensed dose (30μg). We found that binding and neutralizing antibody responses to the
 reduced dose of 20μg were indeed inferior to the full dose of 30μg of BNT162b2, but neverthe-
 less still markedly higher than responses induced by other approved COVID-19 vaccines with
 proven efficacy.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> REDU-VAC is a participant-blinded, randomised, phase 4, multicentre, non-inferiority study
 investigating safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a fractional dose of the mRNA
 COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech). Recruitment occurred at five sites across
 Belgium of the ‘External Department of Prevention and Protection at work’ of Mensura.
 Two prime-boost schedules are compared consisting, respectively, of two doses of 20μg
 (reduced dose schedule) and two doses of 30μg (full dose schedule) of BNT162b2. All partici-
 pants were randomly assigned to receive either the reduced or the full dose schedule.
 
<section> Ethics and registration
 
<section> The trial was reviewed and approved by the Erasme Hospital Ethics Committee (P2021/251)
 and the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (EudraCT: 2021-002088-23A).
 The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04852861). The protocol is available in S1
 Appendix, the CONSORT checklist in S2 Appendix.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> Non-previously vaccinated adults aged 18–55 years old who were in good general health or
 having well-controlled co-morbidities, either infection naïve or previously infected, were eligi-
 ble. Exclusion criteria included history of severe adverse reactions associated with a vaccine
 severe allergic reaction to any component of the study intervention, acute severe febrile illness
 or acute infection, pregnancy and breastfeeding.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 
<section> Participants were block-randomised (random block size between 2, 4, 6, and 8, ratio of 1:1:1:1)
 within female/20μg, female/30μg, male/20μg, and male/30μg using the blockrand R package
 the study statistician [18]. The age distribution in each group was then verified to be not differ-
 ent in the four groups using a Kruskal-Wallis test. The obtained p-value was 0.54.
 Participants and laboratory staff were masked to the administered vaccine dose (20μg ver-
 sus 30μg). To ensure participant blinding to the vaccine dose, randomisation lists were kept
 out of sight, vaccines were prepared, and syringes were filled beforehand.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> Participants were informed of the study and asked to register online before study participation.
 Those meeting all inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of the two study groups
 the study statistician and were invited to the baseline visit (day 0) by the study nurses. At the
 baseline visit, participants provided written informed consent before having blood drawn and
 being vaccinated.
 Two different dosages of the same COVID-19 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine were used in the
 study. BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine
 encoding a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. 
<section> The 20μg and 30μg doses were administered via respectively a 0.2 mL and a 0.3 mL intra-mus-
 cular injection into the upper arm.
 Vaccines were administered by trained study nurses at the different trial sites. Participants
 were observed for a minimum of 15 minutes after vaccination. The interval between the two
 vaccine doses was three weeks for all participants. Blood was drawn on days of vaccination
 (day 0 and day 21), four weeks post second dose (day 49), and six months post first dose
 (month six). One week after administration of each vaccine dose, participants were asked to
 record online any experienced local and systemic adverse events as well as their severity (mild/
 moderate/severe). Participants were also asked to record breakthrough infections by register-
 ing online the date of a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test (on the condition that no third
 vaccine dose had been received yet), and in case of symptomatic infection, the duration of
 symptoms. Breakthrough infections were followed-up until administration of a third vaccine
 dose.
 SARS-CoV-2 anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) specific IgG concentrations were mea-
 sured by ELISA (reported as Binding Antibody Units [BAU]/mL) on days 0/21/49 and month
 6. Neutralizing antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan (2019-nCoV-Italy-INMI1, refer-
 ence 169 008V-03893) (days 21/49), the B.1.617.2 Delta variant (83DJ-1) and the BA.1 Omi-
 cron variant (day 49) were measured with a live virus neutralization assay (VNA, reported as
 50% neutralization, NT50) [19]. The VNA was only performed against Delta and Omicron for
 samples with an NT50 (Wuhan) titre >50 and >400 respectively. Cellular responses were mea-
 sured at day 49 both with IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot) as well
 as with multi-colour flow cytometry on a subsample of 45 randomly selected participants.
 Detailed methods are described in the S2 Appendix.
 Previous infection status was established following a decision tree (S1 Fig). Participants
 with a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were considered previously
 infected irrespective of baseline serology. All other participants with a baseline anti-RBD IgG
 titre <5 BAU/mL were considered infection naïve, and those � 30 BAU/mL were considered
 previously infected. Participants with a titre � 5 and < 30 BAU/mL were further tested with
 different, multiplexed immunoassay (Multi-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassay) detecting four tar-
 gets: RBD, spike subunit 1 (S1), spike subunit 2 (S2) and nucleocapsid (N) [19]. Participants
 with �3 out of 4 targets positive were considered previously infected.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome was serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG concentration 28 days post sec-
 ond dose (day 49) in infection naïve participants. Secondary outcomes included reactogenicity,
 as measured by reported local and systemic adverse events in the week following each vaccina-
 tion, and safety, as measured by suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, serious
 adverse reactions, and adverse reactions with grade equal or more than three over the entire
 study period.
 Immunological secondary outcomes include SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG at day 0, day
 and month 6; VNA titres at days 21 (Wuhan) and 49 (Wuhan, Delta and Omicron); and
 SARS-CoV-2 specific cell frequencies at day 49 in infection naïve participants only as well as
 infection naïve and previously infected participants combined.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> The sample size was calculated assuming a true difference of geometric means of the primary
 outcome on the log 
<section> 10 scale being 0 between the reduced and the full dose, and a standard devi-
 ation of GMT on the log 
<section> 10 scale being 0.27 [19]. A minimum of 50 naïve participants per arm 
<section> was necessary to achieve 90% power at a two-sided 5% significance level. The geometric mean
 ratio (GMR) was then calculated as the anti-logarithm of the difference between the mean on
 the log 
<section> 10 scale of the primary outcome in the reduced dose and that in the full dose (reference
 dose), after adjusting by a mixed-effect linear model using age, gender, and baseline titre of
 SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG as fixed factors and study sites as random factor. To conclude on
 non-inferiority between the two groups, the WHO criterion of 0.67 was used [20], i.e. the
 reduced dose was considered non-inferior when the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the
 GMR was greater than this cut-off. In the same way, GMRs were also calculated at day 49 for
 VNA titres against Wuhan and Delta variants.
 The proportion of participants with responses higher than the lower limit of detection were
 calculated for SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG at days 0, 21 and 49, and for VNA titres at days
 (Wuhan) and 49 (Wuhan, Delta, Omicron) with 95% CI calculated by the binomial exact
 method. They were compared between the reduced and the full dose groups using the Fisher’s
 exact test. Data below the lower limit of detection were given a value equal to half of the thresh-
 old before transformation. Comparisons of primary and secondary outcomes were evaluated
 by linear mixed-effect model adjusting for age, gender, and baseline titre of SARS-CoV-2 anti-
 RBD IgG (for days 21 and 49) or naïve/not naïve category (for day 0) as fixed factors and study
 sites as random factor. Correlations between SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG and VNA titres
 (Wuhan), and between VNA against Wuhan and Delta variants were evaluated by Pearson
 correlation coefficients. Concerning cellular responses, the proportion of participants with
 responses higher than 0 in IFN-γ ELISpot and with a positive response in flow cytometry was
 computed at day 49 with 95% CI calculated by the binomial exact method. Fisher’s exact test
 was used to compare reduced and full dose groups. For IFN-γ ELISpot analysis, data equal to
 were given a value of 1 before transformation, and for flow cytometry, negative frequencies
 were given a value of 0.0001 before transformation. Comparisons of GMTs were evaluated by
 linear mixed-effect model adjusting for age, gender, and baseline titre of SARS-CoV-2 anti-
 RBD IgG as fixed factors and study sites as random factor. All statistical analyses were done
 using R version 4.1.2.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Between April 19 and April 23, 2021, 152 participants were screened for eligibility in five sites
 across Belgium among whom 145 were enrolled in the study and randomized (Fig 1). Four
 participants were excluded from the analysis due to pregnancy, active infection, high-risk con-
 tact or medical reasons. Participants were mostly female (69.5%), of European origin (95%),
 with a mean age of 40.4 years (SD 7.9). Six participants (4.3%) were taking medication to treat
 a co-morbidity. Baseline characteristics were well balanced across the two study arms
 (Table 1). Hundred twenty-four participants were considered SARS-CoV-2 infection naïve
 and 17 were previously infected at baseline. Here, we focus on the results of the per-protocol
 (PP) analysis including infection naïve participants only and present the results of the inten-
 tion-to-treat (ITT) analysis, including both naïve and previously infected participants, in sup-
 plementary data.
 At the primary endpoint, 28 days post second dose, the GMT of SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD
 IgG in the PP cohort was 1705 BAU/ml in the 20μg group and 2387 BAU/ml in the 30μg
 group (Fig 2). The GMR of 0.714 (0.540–0.944, 95% CI) indicated that non-inferiority was not
 demonstrated given that the lower limit of the 95% CI was inferior to the WHO recommended
 margin of 0.67. Similarly, the ITT analysis did not demonstrate non-inferiority of the reduced
 dose either, with GMTs of 1822 BAU/ml and 2381 BAU/ml in the 20μg and 30μg arms, respec-
 tively, and a GMR of 0.765 (0.593–0.987, 95% CI) (S1 Table).

<section> We observed strong correlations between SARS-CoV-2 binding (anti-RBD IgG) and neu-
 tralizing (Wuhan NT ) antibody titres in both the reduced and the full dose arms (Fig 3A).
 a result, GMRs for neutralizing titres were similar to those described above for binding titres.
 Indeed, GMTs of neutralizing antibody titres against Wuhan were 160 (124–206) and 216
 (172–270) in the 20μg and 30μg arms, respectively, with a GMR of 0.740 (0.562–0.974) (Fig 2).
 In the ITT analysis, GMTs were 216 (95% CI: 170–276) and 279 (224–347) in the 20μg and
 30μg arms, respectively, with a GMR of 0.776 (0.592–1.017) (S1 Table). In both analyses, non-
 inferiority was not demonstrated.
 Neutralizing antibodies against Delta and Omicron were only tested for participants with
 an NT50 (Wuhan) >50 and >400, respectively. As expected, neutralizing capacity against
 these variants was much lower compared to Wuhan. In the samples tested, just 21/56 (38%)
 and 25/63 (40%) naïve participants had detectable Delta neutralizing titres in the 20μg and
 30μg arms, respectively (Table 2). For Omicron, none of the naïve participants (0/8 and 0/11
 for 20μg and 30μg, respectively) had detectable neutralizing activity. Titres against Wuhan and
 Delta were strongly correlated in both study arms (Fig 3B). Correlation between Wuhan and
 Omicron could not be determined due to the mostly undetectable titres. Non-inferiority of the

 reduced dose to the full dose was demonstrated for Delta neutralizing titres, in the PP and ITT
 analyses, as the lower limit of the 95% CIs were superior to the WHO margin of 0.67 (Fig
 and S1 Table). As all Omicron neutralizing titres were undetectable in naïve participants,
 regardless of the study arm, a non-inferiority analysis was not performed.
 In both the reduced and full dose study arms, all participants had seroconverted by 28 days
 post second dose (Table 2, Fig 4A). However, the GMTs of anti-RBD IgG were significantly
 lower in the 20μg arm compared to the 30μg arm at the time of the second dose administration
 (day 21) and 28 days later (day 49). At six months post first dose anti-RBD IgG titres had
 waned significantly, but all participants remained seropositive. The GMT of anti-RBD IgG was
 still significantly lower in the reduced dose arm at this time point (Table 2, Fig 4A). In terms
 neutralizing activity, 56/60 (93%) versus 63/64 (98%) of naïve participants from the 20μg arm
 and the 30μg arm, respectively, had detectable neutralizing antibody titres against Wuhan,
 with a significantly lower titre in the reduced dose versus full dose arm 28 days post second
 dose (Table 2, Fig 4B). Neutralizing antibodies against Delta and Omicron were only measured
 at day 49 and did not differ significantly between the two study arms (Table 2, Fig 4C and 4D).
 Cellular responses elicited against a pool of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (S1) and
 (S2) peptides, measured with IFN-γ ELISpot, were not significantly different either between
 the reduced and full dose arms, either in the PP or the ITT cohort (Tables 2 and S2). The pro-
 portion of participants with detectable responses was also not significantly different, with 67%
 (41–87) versus 79% (58–93) for S1 in the 20μg and 30 μg arms, respectively, and 61% (36–83)
 versus 67% (45–84) for S2 in the 20μg and 30 μg arms, respectively (Table 2), in the PP cohort.
 Similar findings were observed in the ITT cohort (S2 Table). These data were corroborated by
 flow cytometry, where no differences were observed between the reduced and full dose arms

 A total of 18 breakthrough infections (BTI) were reported and all occurred between five to
 eight months after the first dose, coinciding with a major infection wave in the country due
 the Delta variant (S3 Table). These BTIs occurred exclusively in infection naïve participants
 and were as likely to occur in the 20μg arm as in the 30μg arm (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.80).
 GMTs of binding and neutralizing antibodies at 28 days post second dose or six months post
 first dose were not significantly different between those experiencing and not experiencing a
 BTI (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p>0.14).
 No serious adverse events were reported during the study period. No difference in fre-
 quency or severity of adverse events reported after each vaccine dose was observed between
 the 20μg and the 30μg arm (S4 Table, S3 Fig). The only exception was the reported severity of
 nausea after the second dose which was mostly moderate in the 20μg arm and mild in the 30μg
 arm.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> The study results show that the administration of a reduced dose (2x20μg) of the mRNA vac-
 cine BNT162b2 induces lower titres of SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG binding and SARS-CoV-2
 Wuhan neutralizing antibodies than the administration of the full vaccine dose (2x30μg). No
 such difference was observed for SARS-CoV-2 Delta neutralizing antibodies but this can likely
 be explained by the overall lower titres as compared to Wuhan, with many participants having
 undetectable neutralizing antibody titres post vaccination. For Omicron neutralization, none
 of the naïve participants had detectable titres, precluding a proper comparison between study
 arms but highlighting the lack of induction of neutralizing capacity against the Omicron vari-
 ant with two doses of BNT162b2. Our findings contrast those from the phase-I/II trial report
 by Sahin et al. where a double 20μg dose did not induce lower humoral responses than the
 double full 30μg dose. It is possible that the much larger sample size of our study (70 versus
 per group) enabled us to reveal the relatively modest difference in response between both
 study arms. 
<section> The ratios of the GMTs across all analyses indicate that the investigated reduced dose regi-
 men induced around 25–30% lower antibody titres than the licensed full dose regimen. The
 magnitude of this reduction and its potential impact on vaccine efficacy needs to be put into
 perspective, however. A recent non-inferiority trial compared immunogenicity of Pfizer-BioN-
 Tech’s BNT162b2 with Astra-Zeneca’s adenoviral ChadOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, amongst other
 vaccination regimens. At 28 days post second dose, the GMT of anti-spike binding IgGs was
 90% lower for ChadOx1 nCoV-19 than for BNT162b2 [21]. Despite ChadOx1 nCoV-19’s
 markedly lower humoral responses, it still has been shown to have an efficacy against symp-
 tomatic infection of about 70%, and it has been approved for use in 182 countries with more
 than two billion doses administered, primarily in LIC [13,22]. While it is possible that other,
 antibody independent factors contribute to the success of the ChAdOx1 vaccine, the well-doc-
 umented and strong correlation between vaccine efficacy and neutralizing antibody titres
 makes us argue that the moderately lower humoral response of the reduced dose regimen
 investigated in our study is still excellent, and likely provides significant protection against
 COVID-19 with additional benefit as compared to the non-mRNA vaccines currently in use
 most low and middle-income countries [14,15]. In order to support this notion, larger immu-
 nogenicity and effectiveness trials are warranted, as well as non-inferiority trials directly com-
 paring lower dosage of e.g. an mRNA vaccine with the standard dosage of an adenoviral
 vectored vaccine as currently used in low and middle-income countries.
 In contrast to the humoral responses, we did not observe any significant differences in the
 cellular immune responses to vaccination. We used both ELISpot and flow cytometry to quan-
 tify SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunits 1 and 2 specific cells, both showing very similar fre-
 quencies between study arms. This was not entirely unexpected, considering that differences
 in cellular responses have been reported before to be less pronounced than those in humoral
 responses [21]. The equivalent cellular immune responses observed in this study further sup-
 port the notion that this reduced dosage likely induces potent immunity.
 While acknowledging that this trial was not designed nor powered to study efficacy of pro-
 tection, we did not observe an obvious difference in incidence of breakthrough infections
 between both study arms. It is important to consider, however, that these infections were most
 likely caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, around six months after vaccination, while
 neutralizing titres against the Delta variant at 28 days post second dose were already very low
 for both the reduced and full dose arms. In other words, a possible difference in protection
 may have gone unnoticed due to a generally low incidence of infection during the first months
 following vaccination.
 Based on waning antibody data and the emergence of new variants, high-income countries
 are providing third doses to the general population, and several countries have started admin-
 istering fourth doses to specific groups with comorbidities. In the meantime, primary vaccina-
 tion coverage in LIC remains very low. The COVAX program was founded in April 2020 with
 the specific aim to provide global equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. The program has
 delivered approximately one billion vaccine doses to 144 participating countries, but current
 production capacity for COVID-19 vaccines does not cover the global needs, thus delaying the
 end of the pandemic. We acknowledge that the use of fractional doses is associated with a
 number of programmatic and operational challenges which may hamper its roll-out, such as
 the possible need for special syringes, adjustments of diluent volumes, or exacerbated vaccine
 hesitancy due to lower antibody levels [23,24]. Nevertheless, we believe that these challenges
 are rather limited and can still be solved relatively quickly, with the important exception of
 vaccine hesitancy which already presents a major barrier to effective roll-out even without
 fractional dosing. In addition, more structural strategies to speed up vaccination rates, such
 strengthening logistics and building local vaccine production capacity, are important but will 
<section> take a considerable amount of time to have an impact. Finally, the effects of fractional dosing
 on issues such as antibody waning and induction of variant cross-reactivity, amongst others,
 also need to be investigated further.
 This study has several limitations, the first being the relatively limited sample size. A larger
 number of participants would have resulted in smaller confidence intervals around the GMRs,
 which might have impacted the conclusions on non-inferiority. Although males were under-
 represented in this study, we do not believe this is a major limitation as immune responses to
 COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in healthy, younger subjects are only minimally gender-depen-
 dent and importantly, there is no basis to assume that fractional dosing would affect immune
 responses differently between males and females [25–27]. Secondly, the small proportion of
 previously infected participants in our study population (17/144, 12%) does not allow for a
 separate sensitivity analysis in this group. With record high COVID-19 incidences worldwide,
 the proportion of the population who experienced a past infection is rapidly growing, making
 analyses including previously infected people ever more relevant. In addition, breakthrough
 infections were not actively monitored by regular molecular testing. Therefore, we may have
 missed asymptomatic infections, which are not reported by the study participants. Thirdly,
 while protection from infection or disease has been convincingly correlated with titres of bind-
 ing and neutralizing antibodies, as discussed previously, it is not possible to determine with
 certainty that the moderately lower titres observed in our study will translate to equally moder-
 ately lower efficacy of protection [15,28]. Fourth, while the interval of three weeks between
 both vaccine doses is recommended by the manufacturer, larger intervals are commonly
 adopted and have been shown to induce higher immune responses as compared to the shorter
 three week interval [29,30]. While we do not know whether such larger intervals would
 increase or decrease the difference between both dosing schedules, it is reasonable to assume
 that both dosages would benefit from an extended interval. As a result, with extended intervals,
 the lower dosed mRNA vaccine evaluated in this study might compare even better to the ade-
 noviral vectored vaccine. Finally, a strength of the study in terms of global health relevance,
 the relatively young age distribution of our cohort, ranging from 23 to 55 years old (median:
 40). This makes our data especially relevant for the context where it can be applied most, i.e.
 LIC where age distribution is typically much lower than in high income countries (97% versus
 81% of population below 65 years old, respectively) [31]. Nevertheless, further studies are
 needed including participants who are more reflective of the target population in terms of
 genetic background and environment.
 To our knowledge, this is the only non-inferiority study reporting on fractional dosing of
 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine so far. Our study shows moderately lower humoral responses and
 similar cellular immune responses after two reduced doses of 20μg compared to two full doses
 of 30μg of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Nevertheless, antibody responses to the reduced
 dose remain far superior to what has been published in the literature so far for marketed ade-
 noviral vector vaccines with proven efficacy of protection against disease. Considering this and
 the important potential in accelerating vaccination rates in LIC, our findings support the need
 for larger non-inferiority trials on fractional dosing for primary vaccination as well as for fol-
 low-up booster vaccinations. The relevance of our findings goes beyond the current pandemic,
 as they highlight the potential of fractional dosing as a dose-sparing strategy in future epidem-
 ics and vaccine shortages.
