<section> Abstract
 
<section> About 25% of 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War veterans experience disabling fatigue, widespread pain, and
 cognitive dysfunction termed Gulf War illness (GWI) or Chronic Multisymptom Illness (CMI). A leading theory
 proposes that wartime exposures initiated prolonged production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and central
 nervous system injury. The endogenous antioxidant L-carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a potential treatment
 since it is a free radical scavenger in nervous tissue. To determine if nutritional supplementation with
 L-carnosine would significantly improve pain, cognition and fatigue in GWI, a randomized double blind placebo
 controlled 12 week dose escalation study involving 25 GWI subjects was employed. L-carnosine was given as
 500, 1000, and 1500 mg increasing at 4 week intervals. Outcomes included subjective fatigue, pain and
 psychosocial questionnaires, and instantaneous fatigue and activity levels recorded by ActiWatch Score devices.
 Cognitive function was evaluated by WAIS-R digit symbol substitution test. Carnosine had 2 potentially
 beneficial effects: WAIS-R scores increased significantly, and there was a decrease in diarrhea associated with
 irritable bowel syndrome. No other significant incremental changes were found. Therefore, 12 weeks of
 carnosine (1500 mg) may have beneficial cognitive effects in GWI. Fatigue, pain, hyperalgesia, activity and
 other outcomes were resistant to treatment.

<section> 1. Introduction
 
<section> Gulf War illness (GWI) is a multisymptom disorder affecting an estimated 25% of the 700,000 military veterans
 of the First Persian Gulf War (1990-91) (Fukuda et al., 1998; Kang, Li, Mahan, Eisen, & Engel, 2009; Research
 Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans’ Illnesses [RAC-GWVI], 2008). GWI veterans have a wide
 spectrum of “functional” complaints including disabling fatigue, diffuse musculoskeletal pain, gastrointestinal
 dysfunction, sleep abnormalities, and cognitive impairments (Spencer et al. 1998; McCauley et al. 2002; Steele
 2000). Neurological dysfunction may be a common pathophysiological mechanism. This would be consistent
 with the hypothesis that war time exposures to combinations of low levels of sarin and other nerve gas agents,
 the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine bromide, organophosphate and other pesticides, particulate and
 volatile organic compounds in smoke from oil-well fires, depleted uranium, immune activation by simultaneous
 administration of multiple vaccines and their adjuvants, and stressors of deployment to a hot, dry, dehydrating
 environment may have acted synergistically to initiate central nervous system injury (RAC-GWVI, 2008; Steele,
 Sastre, Gerkovich, & Cook, 2012; Glass et al., 2006; Hernández et al., 2012; Harley et al., 2011; Block et al.,
 2004). Stressors combined with pyridostigmine bromide, N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), and permethrin can
 disrupt the blood brain barrier and cause neuron death in animal models (Abdel-Rahman, Shetty, & Abou-Donia,
 2002). Reactive oxidant species (ROS) may mediate the neuronal damage (Golomb, 2008; Li, Shou, Borowitz,
 
<section> & Isom, 2001).
 
<section> If ROS production is a continued component of GWI neuropathology, then brain antioxidants may have a critical
 protective role. Differences in production or turnover of endogenous or supplemental antioxidants may be one
 factor that discriminates between veterans who have developed GWI and those without the syndrome.
 L-Homocarnosine (γ-aminobutyric acid – L-histidine) is the premier antioxidant dipeptide in the brain.
 Unfortunately, this chemical is not available for clinical use. L-Carnosine (β-alanine-L-histidine) is a closely 
<section> related dipeptide that may scavenge ROS in the central nervous system (Boldyrev, Dupin, Bunin, Babizhaey, &
 Severin, 1987; Kohen, Yamamoto, Cundy, & Ames, 1988) and act as an antioxidant and buffering ion in muscle
 and possibly other peripheral tissues (Abe, 2000; Holliday & McFarland, 2000). Carnosine may promote brain
 health because autistic children taking 800 mg a day demonstrated significant cognitive improvements (Chez et
 al., 2002). This suggested that carnosine may cross the blood brain barrier.
 
<section> The primary aims of this pilot Phase I/II study were to determine if carnosine improved activity and
 instantaneous fatigue scores (ActiWatch Score accelerometer device, MiniMiter, Bend, OR) (Gironda, Lloyd, &
 Clark, 2007; Kim et al., 2010), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) Severity Score (Baraniuk, Clauw, & Gaumond,
 1998; Baraniuk, Naranch, Maibach, & Clauw, 2000) pain and tenderness (dolorimetry) (Naranch et al., 2002)
 and quality-of-life domains (Sherbourne, 1995) compared to placebo in GWI subjects. Psychometric and
 cognitive measures were secondary outcomes.
 
<section> 2. Materials and Methods
 
<section> 2.1 Study Design
 
<section> This randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot study of carnosine (500 mg capsules, Village Green
 Apothecary, Bethesda, MD; Food and Drug Administration Investigational New Drug FDA IND # 101,700)
 versus indistinguishable microcrystalline cellulose capsules was tested as add-on therapy in GWI. Dose
 escalation started with 500 mg once daily, and increased to 500 mg twice daily, and then 1,000 mg in the
 morning and 500 mg in the evening (1,500 mg/day) at 4 week intervals (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
 NCT00810368). Sets of 4 x 100 capsule bottles were prepared and blocks with 3 placebo and 3 carnosine sets
 randomly mixed. Each set was assigned a sequential 6 digit alpha-numerical identification code so study drug
 could be dispensed by research pharmacists not involved in blinding the study. After the week 12 visit, the
 capsules per day were tapered by 1 per week until discontinued. The study was approved by the Georgetown
 University Institutional Review Board (ID # 2008-068). Data analysis, recruitment, protocol implementation,
 and patient participation all occurred at Georgetown University Medical Center and Hospital in Washington,
 D.C. of the United States.
 
<section> The planned sample size of n=13 subjects completing each arm was based on individual incremental
 improvements (Δ) in the primary outcomes of: (i) CFS Severity Score (Δ ≥ 5 / 32) (Baraniuk et al., 1998;
 Baraniuk et al., 2000a; Baraniuk, Naranch, Maibach, & Clauw, 2000b); (ii) instantaneous fatigue (Δ ≥ 2 using
 the 0 to 10 point ordinal scale) (Kim et al., 2010); (iii) activity levels (Δ ≥ 20%) using ActiWatch Score
 accelerometer devices (Gironda et al., 2007); and (iv) increased accuracy of 4 / 35 letters on 2-back working
 memory tasks performed during fMRI testing (Owen, 2005; Caseras et al., 2006; Altman, 1991; Altman, 1982;
 Cohen, 1988) (The 2-back tests and fMRI results will be reported elsewhere). Secondary outcomes are described
 below. Stringent, conservative criteria for significant treatment responses required: (a) balanced groups with
 comparable week 0 values, (b) significant improvement with carnosine but not placebo by 2-tailed paired
 Student’s t-tests (p ≤ 0.05), and (c) significant differences between the 2 treatment responses at week 12 (p ≤
 0.05 by 2-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests). Fisher’s Exact test was used when required. Data were reported as
 means and incremental changes (Δ) between weeks 0 and 12 ± standard deviations (SD).
 
<section> 2.2 Subject Recruitment
 
<section> Subjects were recruited by on-line and newspaper advertisements, and other contacts. Telephone informed
 consent was obtained to determine eligibility and contact information. GWI subjects were eligible if they met the
 1998 CDC criteria (Fukuda et al., 1998; RAC-GWVI, 2008) or had been diagnosed with chronic fatigue
 syndrome after Persian Gulf deployment (Gray, Reed, Kaiser, Smith, & Gastanaga, 2002). Exclusions included
 active military personnel, pregnant women, children, persons suffering from major chronic illnesses or
 psychiatric disorders, and persons with metal implants or other exclusions from fMRI testing (Fukuda et al.,
 1998; Kang et al., 2009; RAC-GWVI, 2008; Spencer et al., 1998; McCauley et al., 2002; Steele, 2000).
 
<section> 2.3 Study Questionnaires
 
<section> The CFS Severity score allowed subjects to score the cardinal features of fatigue, cognition, sore throat, lymph
 nodes, myalgia, arthralgia, sleep and exertional exhaustion (Fukuda et al., 1994; Reeves et al., 2003; Reeves et
 al., 2005) as none (0), trivial (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4) (Baraniuk et al., 1998; Baraniuk et al.,
 2000a; Naranch et al., 2002; Wasserfallen, Gold, Schulman, & Baraniuk, 1999) The maximum sum for this
 severity score was 32. Medical Outcome Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36) domains were assayed for changes in
 quality of life (Ware & Sherbourne, 1995). Additional secondary symptom and psychometric questionnaires
 were completed to corroborate and expand data on GWI symptom co-variance and overlap with other syndromes 
<section> (see Supplementary online material, SOM). The instruments were assessed for magnitudes, standard deviations,
 and reproducibility between weeks 0 and 12 to determine which may be of value for future studies. Subjects
 could complete the questionnaires on paper or our on-line, Google-based system. Each subject received a
 personal log-in, password and confidential identification code to access and score the questionnaires (Zheng et
 al., 2011a; Zheng et al., 2011b). No personal identifying information was collected over the internet. All data
 were stored in confidential fashion on a password protected computer.
 
<section> 2.4 Study Visits
 
<section> If eligible, subjects came to the Clinical Research Unit, Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C., for
 their screening visit. After reviewing the study protocol and participant responsibilities, subjects gave written
 informed consent for participation. Mental competence was assured by Mini-Mental Status examination
 (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975). History was confirmed using a scripted interview that included
 diagnostics for CFS (Fukuda et al., 1994), fibromyalgia (Wolfe et al., 1990; Wolfe et al., 2010), myalgic
 encephalomyelitis (ME) (Carruthers et al., 2011), irritable bowel syndrome (Lea, Hopkins, Hastleton, Houghton,
 & Whorwell, 2004; Kurland, Coyle, Winkler, & Zable, 2006) and migraine (Headache Classification
 Subcommittee of the International Headache Society, 2004; Ravindran, Zheng, Timbol, Merck, & Baraniuk,
 2011).
 
<section> Subjects had physical examination, counting of manual tender points (Wolfe et al., 1990) and dolorimetry
 (Naranch et al., 2002). Screening blood work was drawn for HIV, pregnancy, blood counts, transaminases, and
 markers of inflammation. Cognitive function was assessed by Trail Making tests A and B (Corrigan &
 Hinkeldey, 1987) and digit symbol substitution test (Joy, Fein, Kaplan, & Freddman, 2000). Subjects toured the
 Center for Function and Molecular Imaging (CFMI) and practiced 0- and 2-back testing until they felt competent.
 They returned later for their fMRI with cognitive testing.
 
<section> Subjects wore ActiWatch-Score wrist devices (Gironda et al., 2007) for the first 2 weeks of the study, and weeks
 12 to 14. In preliminary tests, it was difficult to discriminate between periods of rest and sleep related to chronic
 fatigue and sedentary work (e.g. computer) performed by control subjects. Diaries were consulted to confirm
 periods of rest and sleep. Average accelerometer values for each 1 hour epoch during sedentary periods were <
 40 units (mean + 2 standard deviations). This threshold distinguished “rest” from “active” periods. Records were
 reviewed for times when the watches were removed (zero activity). The percent of active epochs (% Active
 Time) during the entire time the devices were worn was used as an outcome variable. The average activity levels
 during active periods were also calculated on the assumption that treatment may be associated with more
 vigorous or prolonged movement. The Score alarm buzzed randomly at approximately 1 hour intervals to remind
 subjects to grade their instantaneous fatigue on a scale of 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (worst fatigue in life) (Kim et al.,
 2001). The average fatigue score for each day and the standard deviations and coefficients of variation were
 calculated to assess the magnitude of daily fluctuations in this symptom, and the trends for fatigue within each
 week period.
 
<section> Contact was maintained during the study by telephone and e-mail. Subjects who developed adverse events or
 discontinued participation were quizzed for their rationale. Symptoms, laboratories, and questionnaires were
 assessed at the week 6 safety visit. The week 12 visit followed the same format as week
 
<section> 3. Results
 
<section> 3.1 Subjects and Adverse Events
 
<section> Between February 2008 and November 2011 a total of 358 subjects were contacted about participation. Two
 hundred were interested and began the verbal screening process. Thirty-four subjects were enrolled and
 randomized. Nine subjects did not complete the study. Two were terminated. One developed an exacerbation of
 their typical severe musculoskeletal costochondritic chest pain, but was referred by their primary care physician
 to a cardiologist (Grade 1 adverse event, not related). Another was found to have elevated globulins at week
 This participant did not return for follow-up or respond to any inquiries, and was lost to contact (Grade 2 adverse
 event, not related). Three subjects stopped participation within the first 2 weeks of the study and did not reply to
 any inquiries.
 
<section> Three subjects did not want to continue in the study after they reached the 6 week mark because they were
 frustrated by the absence of any improvements. One moved away after 8 weeks. One subject was found to have
 an asymptomatic elevation of alanine-serine transaminase plus interval increase in CRP (remained in normal
 range). As per protocol, study drug was discontinued for 2 weeks. Hepatitis A, B and C serologies were negative,
 and tests normalized. Study drug was restarted and no alterations in symptoms or blood tests developed. This

 carnosine- -related change e in score. The e carnosine tre eatment group scores improv ved significant tly between we eek

 week 12 – week 0 incre emental chang ges were signif ficantly differe ent between th he carnosine a and placebo gr roups

 and centra al sensitization (Latremoliere e & Woolf, 09; Pietrobon, 2005; Baron, 2006).
 
<section> 4. Discuss 
<section> sion
 
<section> Carnosine treatment wa as associated with increase ed digit symb ol substitution n scores sugg gesting a cogn nitive
 benefit. Th his test has be een associated d with activati ion of the fro onto-parietal br rain network (Usui et al., 2009; 
<section> Geake & Hansen, 2010). In contrast, there were no changes for Trail Making tests A and B that may assess
 inter-hemispheric cognitive processing (Corrigan & Hinkeldey, 1987). If so, carnosine may have selective
 trophic or protective effects in discrete brain regions.
 
<section> Carnosine treatment was also associated with reduced stool frequency indicating an improvement in diarrhea.
 Other questionnaire outcomes including the primary aims were not altered by either carnosine or placebo
 treatments. Subjects’ levels of complaints were remarkably reproducible between week 0 and week 12. The
 symptoms caused significant disability based on SF-36 quality-of-life scores.
 
<section> The absence of a placebo effect was important because the expectations of improvement did not translate into
 symptomatic improvement. This steadfast reporting demonstrated that GWI veterans were a highly reliable
 group who report their symptoms in a reproducible fashion. As a result, beneficial treatment effects in other
 studies are likely to be true results. The study drug was add-on therapy. The chronic severity of complaints
 suggests that current treatments had limited therapeutic benefits.
 
<section> An extensive data set (SOM) was collected for (a) comparisons to CFS subjects, (b) potential characterization of
 CMI subtypes, (c) post hoc hypothesis generation, (d) selection of appropriate questionnaires for future studies,
 and (e) sample size calculations. Questionnaires assessed fatigue, pain, and interoceptive complaints such as
 rhinitis, dyspnea, irritable bladder and irritable bowel syndromes, and perceived responses to irritant exposures.
 The cognitive improvement suggested by this study may be analogous to changes in autism. Carnosine given as
 800 mg/d for 8 weeks in double blind, placebo controlled fashion to autistic children significantly improved
 behavior, socialization, communication and total scores on the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (Chez et al., 2002).
 The mechanism(s) may include antioxidant actions via the terminal free amino group of β-alanine,
 anticonvulsant properties akin to GABA-ergic agents, chelation of copper and zinc at GABA receptor sites,
 proton buffering, antioxidant and anti-ischemic protection (Ozonoff, Pennington, & Rogers, 1991; Trombly,
 Horning, & Blakemore, 1998; Stvolinsky & Dobrota, 2000).
 
<section> Carnosine improves athletic capabilities, probably due to antioxidant effects or buffering capacity in muscle
 (Abe, 2000; Holliday & McFarland, 2000). Physiological stressors acutely increased avian muscle carnosine by
 10-fold, but had no effect on brain levels (Manhiani et al., 2011). Similar stressor effects have not been studied
 in man.
 
<section> Carnosine is transported across cell membranes by the proton-coupled PepT2 oligopeptide transporter (Jappar,
 Hu, Keep, & Smith, 2009). About 14% is secreted intact into urine within 5 hours (Gardner, Illingworth,
 Kelleher, & Wood, 1991). The remainder may be cleaved by the enzyme carnosine dipeptidase 1 and 2 (CNDP1
 and CNDP2) (Teufel et al., 2003) in the blood or kidney, or transported into liver, muscle or potentially across
 the blood brain barrier (Peters et al., 2011).
 
<section> Carnosine digestion by CNDP1 and CNDP2 releases β-alanine and histidine. The latter can chelate metals and
 scavenge singlet oxygen during ischemia (Abe, 2000; Holliday & McFarland, 2000; Lee et al., 1999). Increased
 histidine absorption into the brain was hypothesized to trigger an increase in brain homocarnosine synthesis by
 the rate limiting enzyme ATP-grasp domain-containing protein 1 (ATPGD1) in astroglial cells (Drozak,
 Veiga-da-Cunha, Vertommen, Stroobant, & Van Schaftingen, 2010). Lumbar punctures and measurements of
 histidine, carnosine and homocarnosine in cerebrospinal fluid would be required to confirm this hypothesis.
 
<section> β-Alanine is the rate limiting substrate for carnosine synthesis by ATPGD1 in human and equine muscle, since
 histidine supplements do not boost carnosine levels (Dunnett & Harris, 1999). β-Alanine supplementation
 improved performance in anaerobic muscle testing (Hoffman et al., 2008). β-Alanine may delay the onset of
 neuromuscular fatigue in intensively exercising athletes (Artioli, Gualano, Smith, Stout, & Lancha 2010).
 Similar effects may not have been evident in our GWI subjects since they were not enrolled in structured aerobic
 or anaerobic training programs or tested for aerobic exercise capacity as part of this pilot study. High doses of
 β-alanine (3 and 6 g/d) improved oxygen utilization during high intensity exercise training in elite athletes
 (Smith et al., 2009; Walter, Smith, Kendall, Stout, & Cramer, 2010), although lower doses do not have effects on
 VO during aerobic testing.
 
<section> 2MAX
 Oral doses greater than 800 mg of β-alanine may induce paresthesias (Artioli et al., 2010). This is of relevance to
 our study since β-alanine (Shinohara et al., 2004) and ATP may bind Mrgprd receptors of murine dorsal root
 ganglion neurons that mediate cutaneous mechanical nociception (Cavanaugh et al., 2009). We found a higher
 drop-out rate in carnosine than placebo treated GWI veterans. They did not report any changes in cutaneous
 perceptions when questioned, but a subliminal effect cannot be ruled out in those subjects who were lost to
 contact. Perceptions of enteric interoceptive sensations may have developed based on changes in gastrointestinal 
<section> complaints. At week 0, half of the carnosine group reported irritable bowel syndrome with mixed diarrhea and
 constipation, but none had predominantly constipation. However, after 12 weeks constipation was present in
 29%, and the rate of mixed diarrhea and constipation had dropped to 14%. The placebo group had no changes in
 irritable bowel complaints. Although it is important not to over interpret these findings in light of the small
 sample size, any treatment that would improve the severe gastrointestinal complaints of GWI would be
 welcomed.
 
<section> A β-alanine enriched diet has anxietolytic effects in mice (Murakami & Furuse, 2010). Scores on the
 Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) (Löwe et al., 2008) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger,
 1985) questionnaires did not change with carnosine treatment. Anxiety was present in 50% of all CMI subjects
 based on GAD-7 scores ≥ 10 (Löwe et al., 2008). Depressive affect was inferred at different rates ranging from
 81% overall using Center for Epidemiological Studies – Depression (CES-D) scores ≥ 16 (Okun, Stein, Bauman,
 & Silver, 1996; Radloff, 1977), 49% for Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores ≥ 17 (Beck, Steer, Ball, &
 Ranieri, 1996; Geisser, Roth, & Robinson, 1997), and 36% for major and 21% for minor depressive affects using
 the PRIME MD questionnaire (Aiarzaguena, Grandes, Salazar, Gaminde, & Sánchez, 2008). These high rates
 were anticipated based on the severity of the symptom profile of these CMI subjects. These states were resistant
 to carnosine therapy.
 
<section> The study was limited by the relatively small sample size. The putative treatment effects require validation in
 similar randomized double blind placebo-controlled studies with larger groups of participants. The small
 sample size was hampered even further by the nine subjects who withdrew. They had no apparent symptomatic
 changes or adverse events. This includes parasthesias that have been noted previously (Artioli et al., 2010).
 Study compliance was excellent based on diaries and pill counts. However, there were no cerebrospinal fluid,
 serum, or urine measurements of carnosine, beta-alanine or histidine to confirm absorption, pharmacodynamics,
 or brain metabolism to homocarnosine. Elevations in brain GABA levels in the treatment group may be
 identified by molecular spectroscopy (analysis in progress).
 
<section> Another limitation was the subjective nature of many of the outcome measures. This was by design for this pilot
 study to assess a broad set of symptomatic and psychometric variables that may have shown beneficial responses
 to this antioxidant therapy. For instance, even though we observed a possible significant improvement in
 symptoms of diarrhea, there are several different sets of criteria for IBS, and this treatment effect could be better
 confirmed with more precise measures for stool form and frequency. In addition, subjects’ scores for many
 questionnaire items were at the upper limits, suggesting possible ceiling effects. Small improvements in their
 conditions may not have been detectable with the scales employed.
 
<section> Hyperalgesia and disability leading to inactivity were assessed in semi-objective fashion by dolorimetry and
 actigraphy, respectively. These outcomes were insensitive to change. It is possible that 12 weeks of add-on
 therapy without adjunctive treatments was insufficient to reverse the consequences of long duration neural
 dysfunction. In particular, the chronicity of the subjects’ complaints may have made it difficult for them to assess
 and identify subjective improvements. Established neural patterns may be resistant to modification. Improved
 understanding of the molecular pathophysiology is required in order to optimally select fMRI and other objective
 outcome measures for treatment studies such as this one.
 
<section> 5. Conclusion
 
<section> This randomized double blind placebo controlled 12 week dose escalation trial of carnosine showed an increase
 in digit symbol substitution score and potentially decreased diarrhea in GWI. Similar larger studies with
 objectively defined and pathophysiologically based outcome measures will be required to confirm and extend
 these findings.
