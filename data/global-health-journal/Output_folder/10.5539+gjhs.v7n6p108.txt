<section> Abstract
 
<section> Background: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is known as one of the most common fungal infection among women of
 reproductive age and considered as an important public health problem. In recent years, due to resistance to
 common antifungal medication, the use of traditional medicine of anti-fungal and herbal treatmentis increased.
 Therefore the objective of this study was to determine the effects of vaginal cream, mixture of yogurt and honey
 and comparing it with clotrimazole vaginal cream on symptoms of Vulvovaginal candidiasis in patients.
 
<section> Methods: In this randomized, triple blind clinical trial of 70 non-pregnant women infected with
 Candidalvulvovaginitis were placed in two groups of Vaginal cream mixed of yogurt and honey recipients (N =
 35) and clotrimazole vaginal cream (N = 35). Both groups were treated for 7 days.At the beginning of study,
 Clinical and laboratory signs and symptoms were registered 7 and 14 days after treatment by questionnaire,
 observation formand secretions medium culture results. Data were analyzed by chi-square test, t test, McNemar
 tests through SPSS version 21. Significance level of 0.05 was considered.
 
<section> Results: The result of present study reveals the significant differences in symptom improvement of yogurt and
 honey, toward clotrimazole group (P <0.05) and also Positive results of the first cultures (one week after
 treatment) in "yogurt and honey" and clotrimazole (20% versus 8.6%) and second time cultivation (14 days after
 treatment) (17.1% versus 8.6%) were similar and there was no significant differences between the two groups.
 
<section> (P>0.05)
 
<section> Conclusion: This study indicated that the therapeutic effects of vaginal cream, yogurt and honey is not only
 similar with clotrimazole vaginal cream but is more effective in relieving some symptoms of vaginal candidiasis.
 Therefore, the use of this product can be suggested as an herbal remedy for candida infection treatment.

<section> 1. Introduction
 
<section> Vulvovaginal candidiasis is one of the gynecological problems in womenand common fungal infection in adult
 women in reproductive age (Abdelmonem, Rasheed, & Mohamed, 2012). Around the world women with any
 races and at any ages would infected to Vulvovaginal candidiasis and this disease is one of the most repeated
 diseases (Babic & Hukic, 2010). This infection is responsible for about 13 million vaginitis in women in North
 America and 64 million women atreproductive age are affected in Brazil (Achkar & Fries, 2010) the prevalence
 of Candida in Iran have been reported 18/5-26% (Pakshir, Akbarzad, batul, & mohaghegh zade, 2010). Recently
 this infection has increased dramatically in term of severity and incidence that is mainly due to the increase in 
<section> cases of immunodeficiency, such as AIDS, cancer, chemotherapy and replacing members (Behmanesh, Pasha,
 Sefidgar, Moqadam Nia, & Ebrahimi, 2010). It is estimated that 75% of women experience the infection at least
 once in their lifetime, 40% -50% of patients with recurrence ofVulvovaginitisrefereed to clinics and about 5-8%
 of infections are frequent in their lifetime. Candida albicans is responsible for 80-95% of
 VulvovaginitisCandidalattacks around the world.Some research have reported the increased prevalence of other
 Candida species, especially C. glabrata, krusei and Parapsilosis (Levin et al., 1998; Samaranayake &
 Samaranayake, 1994; Sobel et al., 2004). Predisposing factors of this disease are including pregnancy, high-dose
 oral estrogen use, Contraceptives pills, diabetes, broad-spectrum antibiotics use, corticosteroids, immune cell
 deficiency and obesity. Infection of the vagina or vulva may be associated with symptoms such as severe itching,
 burning, pain and white or whitish Cottagelike and cheese form secretions (Warren, 2010) The clinical
 characteristics of patients with vulvovaginal candidacies are nonspecific and their misdiagnosis is common and
 leads to delays in the initiation of antifungal therapy. However, it is rarely life-threatening infections. Yet it is
 usually associated with symptoms such as discomfort in sexual disorders, dryness, pain and finally high cost of
 treatment (Hu et al., 2013; Marot-Leblond et al., 2009). VulvovaginitisCandidal annual cost in the United States
 of America in 1995 was $ 18 billion and is expected that rise to $ 3.1 billion in 2014 (Foxman, Barlow, D'arcy,
 Gillespie, & Sobel, 2000). A common treatment for this disease includes high doses of oral or vaginal antifungal
 azole group followed by weekly or monthly long-term maintenance therapy.Despite the high cost of treatment
 many women get a little relief from these treatments and some of the women have experienced the side effects of
 these treatments such as headache, gastrointestinal disorders. The lack of effective treatment result in many
 women and azole resistance and their consequences and limited number of new antifungal drugs cause high
 demand to discover new antifungal drugs that are more effective and less toxicity toward available drugs (Sobel
 et al., 2004; Watson & Calabretto, 2007). Honey as a medicine is being used thousands of years. If it is used
 alone or in combination with other substances in vaginatoinhibit the growth of Candida (Molan, 1992).
 Laboratory and clinical results of honey in inhibiting the growth of various fungi such as Candida has been
 promising (Devkatte, Zore, & Karuppayil, 2005; Wahdan, 1998). This effect is due to the high acidity and
 osmolarity (Namias, 2003; Theunissen, Grobler, & Gedalia, 2001) as well as hydrogen peroxide, small amounts
 of enzymes; diastase, invertase, glucose oxidase, Catalase and phosphatase (Allen, Molan, & Reid, 1991).
 The existence of herbal derivatives such as flavonoids in honey and stimulating the immune system by
 stimulating cytogenesis through activating neutrophils and T and B lymphocyteswould lead to increased
 antibiotic properties of honey (Küçük et al., 2007; Theunissen et al., 2001).
 
<section> Some studies have investigated the ability of orally administered lactobacilli in the colonization of
 vaginaorcolonization reduction of vagina with Candida infections (Falagas, Betsi, & Athanasiou, 2006).
 Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have inhibitory effect on many microorganisms through producing lactic and
 acetic acids bacteriocin, hydrogen peroxide, di-acetyl, acetaldehyde and ammonia (Bromberg, Moreno, Zaganini,
 Delboni, & Oliveira, 2004).Yogurt and Probiotics are commonly used by women when they are infected with
 vaginal infection and can be used as a cheap and effective treatment for vaginal Vulvovaginal candidiasis .If the
 lactobacilli in the yogurt directly applied in the vagina can inhibit the growth of fungi in infected women
 (Ehrström et al., 2010; Falagas et al., 2006). Adding the yogurt and honey increased their antifungal effect and
 make them to inhibit the growth of Candida Albicans.Other studies also support the synergy of honey in
 combination with other drugs to prevent candida growth (Boukraâ & Bouchegrane, 2007). Sissons and et al 2004
 have reported that Monica honey may be useful in oral fungal infections caused by Candida albicans (Sissons,
 Anderson, & Molan, 2004). Also Irish and et al(2006) in their study have shown the antifungal effect of honey
 onCandida albicans, C. glabrata and C. dubliniensis (Irish, Carter, Shokohi, & Blair, 2006). Several studies
 have indicated the effect of yogurt or foreign species of lactobacillus on improvement ofvaginitis candida
 symptoms vaginitis candida (Osset, Garcia, Bartolome, & Andreu, 2001).
 
<section> Haihong and et al (2013) in their study have shown the antifungal effect of yogurt (Hu et al., 2013). While few
 studies do not support the effects of yogurt and probiotics in the prevention of candida (Pirotta, Gunn, &
 Chondros, 2003; Shalev, Battino, Weiner, Colodner, & Keness, 1996). Therefore, considering high incidence of
 vaginitis and its complications and recurrence of fungal vaginitis despite the increasing of current treatments and
 the increasing willingness of people to drugs based on natural materials, the present study conducted with aim to
 investigate the effect of a mixture of yogurt and honey and honey alone on vaginitis candida.
 
<section> 2. Method
 
<section> This study was a randomized, triple blind clinical trial with a control group is registered with number of
 IRCT201401052248N14. In order to compare the effect of vaginal cream mixture of yogurt and honey on 
<section> symptoms of Vulvovaginal candidiasis, the study was conducted in clinics and health centers in the city of Sari,
 Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences in 2013-2014.
 
<section> The sample size for comparison of two groups determined 70 subjects with confidence level of 95%.
 The criteria to enter the study were including; being at age of 18 to 45 years old, Signs and symptoms of vaginal
 candidiasis in interviews, observation and beingconfirmed by laboratory studies, not being pregnant, no previous
 use of antifungal drugs, lack of use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids during the last two weeks,
 the lack of allergy to honey and being non- diabetic, Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, menstruation and

 Methods In this case the researcher after receiving permission from the Ethics Committee of the University of
 Medical Sciences, Tehran and Mazandaran, in order to collect data referred to the study environment and after
 explaining the purpose of the study and informed consent was obtained from samples at first History of patients
 was obtained and in case of having the signs of Vulvovaginal candidiasis (itching, secretionpain during
 intercourse and dysuria) preliminary questionnaire was completed. In case of no prohibition against the inclusion
 criteria, the study was fully explained to the patient. Then, with filling the written consent of the study, in order
 to study the subject was placed in lithotomy position and sterile speculum placed into the vagina without being
 impregnated material and cervix and vagina were evaluated in terms of symptoms and cheesy white secretions,
 erythema and even redness, sores and lesions , papulopustular damagesand any abnormal findings. And it was
 recorded in the observations check list. Then with two sterile cotton swabs (put in an autoclave for 15 minutes at
 120 degrees) of vaginal swab samples were taken at the top and side walls secretions.
 The first swab was drawn on two slides, added 2 drops of normal saline on first slide and examined under the
 microscope for the presence of key cells and Trichomonas vaginalis and in case of observing the key cells of
 Bacterial vaginosis the sample is excluded from the study. 1 drop of KOH 10% solution was added to the second
 slide and examined under the microscope. If Mycelium and blastorare observed smear test was considered
 positive. If this test is positive and the second swab placed into the tube containing the normal Saline to transfer
 to the Chromagar culture medium and sent to laboratory for final diagnosis. Vaginal PH measured by PH meter
 paper. Secretions PH above the 4.5 suggest mixed infection and were excluded from the study. In this
 environment, certain colors that are caused by Candida species were determined (Sivakumar, Shankar, Nalina, &
 Menon, 2009). Samples were cultured on Chromagar medium at 37-30 ° C for 72 to 48 hours were placed in the
 incubator and formed colonies on the medium after 72 hours by the doctor were evaluated macroscopically
 Positive culture result makes the diagnosis sure and all Candida species were entered to the study. Then Patients
 were randomly placed in n a vaginal cream, yoghurt, honey and control groups (clotrimazole vaginal
 cream).Vaginal cream yogurt and honey including (Solids, insoluble in water: 0.4%, Humidity: 18%, low-fat
 yogurt, 3.2% fat, dry matter content: 3.7% and PH= 4)by a Pharmacognosy doctor in Armaghan Teb laboratory
 prepared and packaged in Tehran.
 
<section> Clotrimazole vaginal cream 1% made by Raha Company with registration number 1228101540 and packaged in
 the Armaghan Teb laboratory similar to vaginal cream yogurt and honey. And in form of Codes A and B were
 taken to the researcher. The researcher after reference of samples, a box containing 70 the same cards which was
 written by an equal number of letters A and B given to the samples and each patient choose a card randomly and
 the package in the form of written letters on the pharmaceutical form of a vaginal cream was placed in the
 sample, creams applied each night as an applicator (5 g) inside the vagina for 7 nights. Samples, research group,
 and statistical analysis were unaware of the content of cream. Therefore, the present study was conducted as a

 Triple-blind study. All samples were given the guidelines of drug use and health advice including; Daily change
 of underwear, drying underwear under the sun or ironingit after wash, rinse and dry the genital area from front to
 back after a bowel movement every time, Use loose cotton underwear. In addition to explain the Educational
 pamphlet containing health advice that the researcher number is mentioned by the researcher set and is given to
 the subjects to study at home.
 
<section> The criteria for exclusion of the study were Pregnancies during the study, unwillingness of subject to continue
 participation in the study, necessity to use antibiotics during the study, the incidence of allergies to medicines,
 Failure to observe the correct way to treat (forgetting the drug for more than one night).
 Samples were asked to refer to clinic at 7 and 14 days after completion of treatment with a coded card. Also
 through phone calls the time to visit is reminded to patients again. And the effect of drug therapy on the
 symptoms of the disease was studied. And it was recorded in observation checklist. The samples were evaluated
 microscopically. For final confirmation of the presence or absence of fungal, Subculture of samples was prepared.
 Data Analysis using the chi-square test, McNemar test, ANOVA and Student t using SPSS statistical software (21)
 was analyzed and P< 0.05 considered as significant level.

 Based on Fisher's exact test, there were no significant differences between groups before the treatment of the
 
<section> symptoms. (P>O.O5)
 
<section> The results showed that after treatment, improvement in symptoms of sticky white cheese like secretionsin
 Yogurt and honey group was 33 (94.3%) and in the control group was 26 (25.7%). Based on chi-square test
 between the groups after the treatment of signs the statistically significant difference was observed (P<O.O5).
 Inflammation and redness of the vulva and vagina before treatment in group of "yogurt, honey," was 25 (71.4)
 and in the control group, was 25 (71.4).
 
<section> Based on chi-square test between the groups before and after treatment of these symptoms, there was no
 
<section> significant difference. (P>0.05)
 
<section> After treatment, the improvement of Symptoms of inflammation and redness of the vulva and vagina in Yogurt
 and honey group 34 subjects (97.1) and in the control group, 27 patients (77.1) was reported. Based on
 chi-square test, no statistically significant difference between the groups after the treatment of the symptoms was
 observed (P<0.05). The other symptoms (pustular lesions and cervical lesions and abnormal cervixhad similar
 improvement in both groups.Chi-square test did not show statistically significant difference between groups in
 
<section> terms of sings. (P>0.05)
 
<section> Present study in both treatment groups, "mixed with yogurt and honey" and clotrimazole showed significant
 reduction in negative cultures or improvement.
 
<section> Microscopic evaluation results (smear wet slide) indicated that yogurt and honey 68/6% and clotrimazole group
 80% had negative cultures after treatment.
 
<section> Chi-square test showed a significant difference in terms of reduction of the positive results of the microscopic
 and culture than before treatment in both groups.(P<0.05)
 
<section> In other words, both groups disease improved in terms of the results of microscopy and culture fluids (Table 4).
 
<section> 4. Discussion
 
<section> Vulvovaginal candidiasis is the most common clinical protests of Candida species that 70-75% women will
 experience it at least once in a lifetime. The study is conducted in order to compare the effect of vaginal cream
 mixed of yogurt and honey on the symptoms of Vulvovaginal candidiasis. The obtained results indicate that
 signs and symptoms of vaginal candidiasis after taking 7 day a vaginal cream yogurt and honey mixed is reduced
 significantly. Results of the study showed that recovery in term of itches in 7 days after treating with mixed of
 yogurt and honey happened in more than ¾ samples and in clotrimazole group occurred in almost two-thirds of
 the cases. In this regard, the result of study of Fazel and et al have reported the Itching recovery in the honey
 group alone and in combination with clotrimazole was 100% and clotrimazole group less than a quarter of the
 samples which demonstrated the alignment with present study. The difference between the symptoms of the 
<section> current study may be related to the use of different measuring instruments (Fazel, Hashemian, Ramezani, &
 Akaberi, 2011).
 
<section> In addition to study results of Allam and et al n 129 pregnant women with Vulvovaginitiscandidiasissuggests that
 the use of yogurt and honey mixture in comparison with itraconazole group (87.8 percent vs. 72.3 percent)
 improves symptoms of Vulvovaginitiscandidiasis. So that itching, secretions, and redness of the vulva and
 vagina, has significantly decreased in consumer group of vaginal cream, yogurt and honey compared to
 itraconazole group (Abdelmonem et al., 2012).In the study of Hilton and et al also the vaginal symptoms of
 women who had used the Jay intravaginal Lactobacillus for 1 or 2 months have recovered (Hilton, Isenberg,
 Alperstein, France, & Borenstein, 1992).Also the study result of Ehrstrom and et al indicated that the effect of
 supplements and probiotic lactobacillus capsules in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and
 Vulvovaginitiscandidiasis (Ehrström et al., 2010).
 
<section> It is assumed that antifungal and anti-inflammatory effect of honey and being rich of lactobacilli and lactic acid
 in yogurt is that make vaginal environment unsuitable for the growth of candidiasis. Also the honey through
 producing the prostaglandins reduces the edema and pain in the inflammatory tissues. In the present study yogurt
 and honey mixture cause inhabitation of colonization of Candida species which is consistent with the findings of
 the study of Irish and et al. (Pirotta et al., 2003). This effect is likely related to the antimicrobial effect of honey
 is due to its Osmolality.
 
<section> In the present study, the combination of honey with yogurtcauses a synergistic effect of honey against
 candidiasis which is consistent with the finding of Boukraaand et al based on the synergistic effect of honey and
 starch against Candida albicans (Boukraâ & Bouchegrane, 2007).
 
<section> The present findings Demonstrates the effectiveness of honey and Yogurt on Negative cultures of samples within
 7 days after the intervention, while no effect was observed in the study of Shalev and et al. (1996). It is assumed
 that difference is due to using honey in mixture with Yogurt and the antimicrobial effect of honey is due to its
 chemical composition and PH of honey is acidic in the present study. Since one of the criteria for inclusion in the
 study was the lack of use of antibiotics in the sampling, therefore the results of the present study was inconsistent
 with the study result of Pirotta and et al about the role of oral or vaginal lactobacilli strains in the prevention of
 Vulvovaginal candidiasis after use of antibiotics.
 
<section> In summary, the present study showed that prescribing the honey in mixture with yogurt in from of vaginal is
 effective in reducing symptoms of Vulvovaginal candidiasis And also had a negative impact on the results of
 microscopy and culture fluids while taking any of these serious side effects have been reported.
 The limitations of this study can be mentioned as Differences in immune systems of subjects and relatively short
 follow-up period. And also Sample loss during the investigation, lack of reference of some subjects for culture
 after treatment were other limitation of the study which leads to the removal of above mentioned cases and
 re-sampling and subsequently increasing the research time. The strengths point of present study is having a
 control group, designing the study in Triple-blind and randomized into two groups of samples.
 
<section> 5. Conclusion
 
<section> In the present study administration of honey in combination with yogurt has desired effect in the treatment of
 vaginal candidiasis. And cause the reduction and recovery of vaginitis candida. Also it is more economical in
 terms of costs. And don’t have the synthetic drugs side effects. Therefore, their use in combination with topical
 formulations for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis wouldbe useful.
