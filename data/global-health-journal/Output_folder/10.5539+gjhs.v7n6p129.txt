<section> Abstract
 
<section> Introduction: Treatment team charged to help patients and their family making decision about donate organs in
 the final stage of life. Hence, their knowledge and attitude is important to plan of increasing the rate of organ
 donation.
 
<section> Materials and Methods: About 150 nurses recruited in this cross-sectional study randomly. After taking
 informed consent, questionnaires were filled. The data collection tool was a multipart questionnaire including
 demographic information, 18 questions about attitude and practice and 15 question about knowledge toward
 organ donation. Data were analyzed by SPSS software using K-squire, Pearson correlation test, T-test, variance
 analyze on 95% confidence interval.
 
<section> Results: Most of participants (76%) were 25-44 years old. About 81.3% of them were female (n=122). The
 attitude average score between males and females was 85.25±35.61 and 70.37±46.53, respectively. The practice
 average score in females was 34.43±47.71 and between males was 29.63±46.53. The knowledge average scores
 were 50.60±16.19 and 56.54±17.48 for two groups (p>0.05). The knowledge average scores between different
 age groups was significant (p<0.05). There was a direct and significant relation between attitude and practice (r=
 +0.33, p<0.05), attitude and Factors influencing attitude and practice (r= 0.866, p<0.05), but the relation between
 attitude and knowledge was indirect and significant (r= -0.183, p<0.05).
 
<section> Conclusions: Since the medical team are most important adviser for promote activities related to organ donation,
 it seems that educational curriculum and facilities should applied to enhance attitude and behavior favorable
 change of personnel towards this issue.
 
<section> Keywords: organ donation, knowledge, attitude, nursing practice
 
<section> 1. Introduction
 
<section> Nowadays, Organ donation became a typical procedure to save life and improve the lives of the patients that
 have a chance to survive (Topic, Brkljacic, & Grahovac, 2006).
 
<section> Organ donation is a standard method of treatment in various diseases; however, the number of patients on the
 waiting list is more than organs that can be donated (Stadlbauer et al., 2013). This procedures saves the life of
 millions of people in the world and is a process in which an organ or part of that grafts to another person
 (Ramadurg & Gupta, 2014).
 
<section> The process of organ donation depends on its presentation and access to families to obtain their consent
 (Douville, Godin, & Vézina-Im, 2014). Various factors play a role in the family decision about this issue, For
 example, Positive beliefs and attitudes about organ donation, Families awareness of the deceased for organ
 donation, having donation card and expressed interest in this area (Siminoff, Gordon, Hewlett, & Arnold, 2001).
 Researches shows that positive and negative attitudes to organ donation may affect the people commitment to do

 this, also, their knowledge and their faith plays an important role in their willingness to donate organs after death
 (Wakefield, Watts, Homewood, Meiser, & Siminoff, 2010). Knowledge and attitudes of medical team about the
 organ donation is very important for planning to Increase the rate of organ donation (Salmani Nadoushan et al.,
 2014). Religious beliefs also play a role in determining attitudes to organ donation. Many religions have resisted
 the idea of organ donation (Rumsey, Hurford, & Cole, 2003).
 
<section> In previous years many efforts have been made to raise public awareness about organ donation that as result, the
 number of Kidney donor increased to double. But because the number of recipients is increasing, most patients
 are placed on a waiting list more than 6 years (Donor Network of Croatia).
 
<section> In England the process of organ donation is managed mainly by nurses and identification of potential donors is
 considered a nursing task. According to vital role that nurses play in the system of organ donation as promotion
 approach of potential donors for organ donation, explaining the process and getting consent, Nurses must receive
 sufficient training to understand the process in order to participate in satisfy the donors and their families
 (McGlade McClenahan, & Pierscionek, 2014).
 
<section> Also the treatment team members are required to help patient and his family to make appropriate decisions in the
 final stages of life (Kent, 2007).Therefore, understanding their attitudes and knowledge can affect the tendency
 to organ donation which entails creation of effective education programs in universities (Tam, Suen, & Chan,
 2012).
 
<section> University training program must have basic information about the procedures and ethical issues related to organ
 donation to notify the medical staff in this domain (KY Chung et al., 2008). Despite the importance of the
 subject, few studies have assessed the knowledge, attitudes and practice of nurses regarding organ donation. So
 this study occurred to determine the level of professionalism and willingness of nurses as well as the effect of
 work experience on their attitudes about organ donation and its trends.
 
<section> 2. Materials and Methods
 
<section> This is a descriptive-sectional study. In total 150 nurses employed in hospitals in 2013 were randomly selected.
 The methods and aims of the study were explained to them and ensure them that the individual information will
 be kept private and after they signed consent forms. Data collection tool was a multi section questionnaire, the
 first section included demographic information such as age, gender, education level and work experience. The
 second part consisted of standard questionnaire that was designed by KY Chung et al. (2008) which included
 items that measured attitude and performance (answer: yes-no) and 15 items to measure the knowledge (answer:
 yes- no-I do not know) about organ donation.
 
<section> 2.1 Statistical Analysis
 
<section> Data were analyzed using SPSS V15 software, by Chi-square test, Pearson test, t-test and ANOVA on a 95%
 confidence level.
 
<section> 3. Results
 
<section> In this study, 18% of nurses were aged 18-24 years, 76% between 25-44 years and 6% of people between 45-64
 years of age. 81.3% of samples were women (n = 122), 40.7% of nurses worked 1-5 years, 38% about 6-11 years,
 13.3% about 12- 17 years and 8% more than 18 years. There was no significant difference between the two
 genders in receiving organ donation card (Table 1).

 In people who have had organ donation card, mean attitude, factors influencing attitude and practice score was
 significantly higher than those did not have donation card. However, there was no difference between clinical
 competence and knowledge score in tow groups
 Among those who think it is important to preserve the body after death, 33% had organ donation card, and 33%
 of those who did not have such thought, registered for donation card so this view had no effect on their
 performance.
 36.3% of agree and 28% of disagree participant to donate their family member’s organs after death, had organ
 donation card. There was no significant difference between two groups.
 47.2% of those declared trained about organ donation through university curriculum and 25.8% of those did not
 receive adequate training, had organ donation card This difference was significant and training can be effective
 on organ donation
 None of those who thought that "a person had an organ donation card, will not receive full medical treatment"
 had donation card. So the training can be effective on organ donation preference.
 96.6% of those have any donation card believed it is not easy to register for organ donation and 100% of them
 did not know where receive such card
 Family members of 24% of those had organ donation card and 43% of others, agreed to donate their organs.
 There was a significant difference between two groups, it means that family members insight can effect on vision
 about organ donation
 4. Discussion
 The main objective of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of nurses toward organ
 donation. Results showed that attitudes are related to the amount of knowledge but it expected to be negative and
 significant. Also people with higher attitude score have better practice in the matter of organ donation.

<section> was no significant difference (p˃0.05)
 The mean clinical competence score for these groups was 25.68±36.21, 26.32±31.96, 40±36.83, and 50±38.92,
 respectively, that there was no significant difference (p˃0.05)
 The mean knowledge score for these groups was 50.16±17.79, 49.82±14.59, 56.33±19.03 and 62.22±9.57,
 respectively, that there was no significant difference (p˃0.05)
 The mean factors influencing attitude and practice score for these groups was 67.49±23.11, 71.35±21.36,
 68.75±29.23 and 70.14±23.69, respectively, that there was no significant difference (p˃0.05)
 According to the Pearson correlation test there was a significant direct relationship between attitudes and Factors
 influencing attitude and practice, but the relation between knowledge and attitude was significant and indirect
 (Table 6). 
<section> Tam et al. (2012) did a study to determine the knowledge, attitude and commitment of nursing students on
 students. A total of 40.6% of them were registered for organ donation. The mean score of the participant’s
 knowledge was 23.7±2.9 and the mean score of their attitudes was 70.2±7.7. About 3.7% of students stated that
 received several propagandistic advertisement about organ donation through public media such as television,
 radio, newspapers, magazines, Internet web pages and other media, while in the present study, 33.3% of
 participants had organ donation card and 35.3% trained about organ donation by the university and hospital’s
 curriculum. Stadlbauer et al. (2013) results showed that their primary source of information was media, friends,
 family, newspapers and seminars. About 44.9% stated their willingness to donate their organs and 77.8% were
 agreed to encourage people toward organ donation.
 
<section> In Georgiadou et al. (2012) research that evaluate the different factors related to the Egyptian's willingness to
 donate organs on 2263 people, about 3.8% of participants were registered for organ donation. Almost half of
 them (48.3%) would receive a membership card, and 49.1% expressed willingness to donate organs of their
 relatives, but 55.7%of theme expressed concern about organ removal and transfer procedures. They believed that
 organ donation is a sin. Women tend to receive organ donation card much more than men. Most participants
 stated their information resources were mass media (70.6%) and magazines (46.2%), also treatment groups
 (33.6%) played a main role in their awareness in this area (Georgiadou et al., 2012). In our study 60.7 % of
 people expressed their willingness to donate organs of their relatives. Also, no significant differences were
 observed between the genders to receive donation card.
 
<section> Zambudio et al. (2009) conducted a study on 305 nurses to analyze their attitudes toward organ donation and the
 factors determining these attitudes. About 63% want to donate their organs. Factors influencing their attitudes
 about organ donation included a favorable attitude toward family’s organ donation (p <0.001), knowing the
 concept of brain death (p <0.005), the definition of organ donation in the family (p = 0.001), favorable attitudes
 toward autopsy (p = 0.006), the fear of mutilation of the body (p <0.001), parental attitudes toward organ
 donation (p <0.001), and ultimately religious affiliation (p = 0.009). Also in this study, there was a significant
 and negative relationship between knowledge and attitudes (P <0.05 and r = -0.183) and a significant positive
 correlation between attitude and practice (Factors influencing attitude and practice) (P <0.05). In Salmani
 Nadoushan et al. (2014) study, about 78% agreed to donate organs after death and 68% had donation card. Also
 78% had a positive attitude to receive organ donation card.
 
<section> In another research 44.8% of participants reported that they have sufficient knowledge about organ donation and
 40.1% have enough knowledge about organ transplantation. They stated the most important sources of
 information include mass media (72.1%).Willingness to donate their organs and their relatives was seen 58.4%
 and 39.9%respectively. Donation of living organ was more acceptable than cadaver’s organs (74.6%). Among
 the participants only 1.2% received organ donation card (Bilgel, Sadikoglu, & Bilgel, 2006). In another study,
 46.8% of participants had organ donation card and 58% were willing to receive card and 13.8% were reluctant to
 do so (McGlade et al., 2014). In the present study, 82% and 60.7% were agreeing to donate their own and
 relatives’ organs, respectively.About36.7% stated that they would also counsel patients and their knowledge is
 sufficient in this domain.
 
<section> A similar study on 262 medical students was conducted to assess the attitudes of physician students about organ
 donation. The results showed that medical students have a positive attitude about organ donation (4.34±0.46).
 Participants were also more inclined to donate their own organs (85%), not relatives (49.2%). There was no
 relationship between age, gender, education level and attitudes to organ donation (Sanavi, Afshar, Lotfizadeh, &
 Davati, 2009). Another study, in most cases, participants orally and in writing stated that honor relatives
 regarding organ donation (Jernigan et al., 2013).
 
<section> 5. Conclusions
 
<section> In this study, the mean attitude in men was significantly lower than women (P <0.05), but there was no
 relationship between attitude and age.
 
<section> Researches show that the individual’s level of education, religious and attitude would be related to their
 commitment in organ donation. Because of effect of these factors on people’s willingness to donate organs, it
 seems that training and educational tools should be applied to improve employees’ attitudes towards this issue.
 Also findings highlight the need for training programs for treatment team and empowering them in all matters
 relating to donations of organs. Since the medical team have the most important guideline to promote activities
 related to organ donation, it seems educational curriculum should be involved this issue to change students
 behavior.
