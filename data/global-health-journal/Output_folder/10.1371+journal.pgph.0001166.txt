<section> Abstract
 
<section> Best practices for the dissemination of global health guidelines has not undergone rigorous
 research. We used a new approach to digitizing World Health Organization (WHO) global
 tuberculosis guideline recommendations (eTB RecMap) and compared its usability to the
 conventional method of accessing TB recommendations using the WHO website. We con-
 ducted a two-arm superiority randomised controlled trial using a survey among global stake-
 holders who were past or planned future users of TB guidelines, recommendations, or
 policy advice. We assigned participants randomly (1:1) to complete an activity using the
 WHO eTB RecMap or the conventional website. The primary outcome was the accessibility
 of information and secondary outcomes understanding, satisfaction, and preference for one
 of the two formats. Between February 26 and August 29, 2021, we received 478 responses
 from stakeholders, of whom 244 (122 per group) were eligible and provided analysable
 results. Participants rated the eTB RecMap as more accessible, on average, when com-
 pared to the conventional website (on a seven-point scale, the mean difference {MD} was
 0.9; 95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.6, 1.2; p < 0.001) and were more likely to correctly
 answer understanding questions. This is the first trial comparing digitized dissemination for-
 mats of health guideline recommendations. Stakeholders rated the WHO eTB RecMap as
 more accessible than the conventional WHO website for the tested recommendations. They
 also understood presented information better. The findings support better usability of TB
 information through the eTB RecMap and contribute to the effort to end the TB epidemic.

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent worldwide, with
 an estimated 10 million new cases in 2019 [1]. In a concerted effort to end the TB epidemic,
 the WHO Global TB Programme (WHO-GTB) has issued guidelines with recommendations
 on TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care [2,3]. Since 2009, these guidelines have been
 developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
 (GRADE) method [3], which is a transparent, evidence-based framework for the assessment
 the certainty in a body of evidence and recommendation development [4]. Specifically,
 GRADE assists guideline developers in question prioritization, certainty assessments, balanc-
 ing benefits and risks, and considering, among other criteria, cost, equity, acceptability, and
 feasibility in context [4,5].
 WHO TB recommendations were located in many discrete publications on the WHO web-
 site, including standard, consolidated, interim, and emergency guidelines. Given the potential
 challenges of navigating through guidelines to find a recommendation, ways to enhance their
 connectivity and accessibility should be explored like for guidelines in other fields. A mixed-
 methods study by Hajizadeh, et al. [6] suggested that stakeholders, including members of the
 WHO-GTB guideline development group (GDG), desire direct access to WHO TB recom-
 mendations and supplementary information, such as evidence to decision (EtD) tables and
 evidence profiles [6].
 In an effort to improve usability of WHO TB recommendations, we developed the WHO
 eTB recommendation map (RecMap) in a collaboration between the WHO Collaborating
 Center for Infectious Diseases, Research Methods and Recommendations, the Michael G
 DeGroote Cochrane Canada Centre and the WHO-GTB Programme [6,7]. The RecMap iden-
 tifies, lists, and maps WHO TB recommendations using recommendation mapping methodol-
 ogy. This methodology builds on the field of evidence mapping by visually organizing
 recommendations, thus allowing the identification of clusters and gaps [6]. Furthermore, it
 anticipated to facilitate the adoption, adaptation, or de novo development of recommenda-
 tions in a variety of countries and settings through an integrated linkage and access to original
 content on GRADEpro [8]. The approach has been used, but not tested formally, in other
 efforts including the eCOVID-19 RecMap to enhance access to all guidelines in general
 (covid19.recmap.org) and for WHO specifically (who.covid19.recomap.org).
 To evaluate if organising recommendations in a recommendation map improves usability,
 we conducted a randomised controlled trial in users of TB recommendations to evaluate the
 impact of the new WHO eTB RecMap compared with the conventional method of accessing
 TB recommendations on accessibility, understanding and satisfaction with the new format.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> This study was a two-arm randomised controlled superiority trial to compare the accessibility
 of the WHO eTB RecMap (WHO eTB) to the conventional method of accessing TB recom-
 mendations through the WHO publications website (WHO TB). A questionnaire was admin-
 istered using SurveyMonkey (Momentive Inc., California), accessible through a link shared
 email. Participants responded to demographic questions and were subsequently randomised
 using 1:1 allocation to access a recommendation using either WHO eTB or WHO TB (plat-
 forms). Participants completed Likert-scale and multiple-choice questions about the platform
 they were allocated to. After completing the key portion of the trial, they received information
 about the alternative platform to respond to a question on their preference. 
<section> This study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board, Hamilton, ON,
 Canada (7908). No data safety monitoring committee was used. This trial was registered with Clin-
 icalTrials.gov (NCT04745897). The protocol is available in the supporting information (S1 File).
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> Stakeholders who considered themselves to be users or potential users of TB guidelines, rec-
 ommendations, and policy advice were eligible. We defined a user as someone who responded
 “yes” to the question “have you ever accessed TB guidelines, recommendations or policy advice
 in the past?”. A potential user was someone who responded “yes” to the question “do you plan
 on accessing TB guidelines, recommendations or policy advice in the future?”. Eligible partici-
 pants could be part of any group with a stake in TB, including the public, healthcare providers,
 policymakers, and researchers, and there were no restrictions on country of origin, level of
 education, or prior TB work experience. Individuals who were involved in WHO eTB develop-
 ment were not eligible, and thus were not invited to participate.
 We used a targeted snowball recruitment strategy by emailing survey links to WHO TB
 Guideline Development Group (GDG) members, program managers, and other stakeholders
 involved in the process of using and applying TB guideline recommendations. We requested
 that these members disseminate the survey within their networks, which may have included
 healthcare providers, policymakers, researchers, and people living with TB (S2 File). Further-
 more, we shared the survey link with TB, infectious disease, and guideline groups on Twitter
 and LinkedIn. Participants gave written informed consent upon entry to the survey.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 
<section> Participant response to a question on their role as a participant in this study was used for strat-
 ification into one of four categories described in Fig 1. Participants within each of these catego-
 ries were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the WHO eTB or WHO TB arms. Participants
 were also randomly assigned to access one of two recommendations in a 1:1 ratio. The same
 two recommendations were presented for both arms and selected because they contain mostly
 plain language and were more accessible to non-clinical participants.
 The allocation sequence was concealed using SurveyMonkey software based on a commer-
 cial, but unknown algorithm without a pre-identified sequence. Participants were not aware
 their random allocation to WHO eTB or WHO TB until disclosure (Fig 1). Thus, participants
 in the control arm were blinded to the eTB RecMap for all outcomes except the secondary out-
 come of preference. Neutral language was used in both trial arms to prevent promotion of the
 intervention or comparison.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> In this randomised controlled superiority trial, the intervention was the new WHO eTB
 RecMap (WHO eTB), and the comparison was the conventional method of accessing TB rec-
 ommendations using the WHO website (WHO TB). We asked survey participants to complete
 an activity in searching for the same recommendation using the one platform which they had
 been randomly allocated. Instructions and questions for both arms were worded as similarly
 possible. See Table 1 for an overview of the differences between WHO eTB and WHO TB.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> This trial used several of the outcomes that have been validated in the evaluation of GRADE
 Summary of Findings (SoF) tables [9–12]. The primary outcome was the accessibility of

<section> information available on the WHO eTB compared to WHO TB. We defined accessibility as
 the ability to access and use the presented information. This outcome considered the four fol-
 lowing domains: (1) how easy it was to find the information (2) how easy it was to understand
 the information (3) whether the presentation facilitated decision-making (4) whether the web-
 site was easy to navigate. We used the original Likert-scale to obtain responses. We used the
 composite of these four outcomes as primary outcome, and the individual domains were also
 analyzed as secondary outcomes.
 Secondary outcomes were understanding, satisfaction, and preference. We defined under-
 standing as the correct comprehension of findings. This outcome was measured using three
 multiple-choice questions with five choices and one correct answer. The questions were: ‘what
 is the recommendation strength?’, ‘what is the certainty of the evidence?’ and ‘on which page
 does the EtD table for this recommendation start?’. We defined satisfaction as a stakeholder’s
 impression of platform presentation. This outcome considered the presentation of three
 domains: (1) home page (2) recommendation list (3) individual recommendation. We used
 the original Likert-scale to obtain responses. We defined preference as a greater liking of one
 platform over the other. All participants were provided with a short demonstration of both
 platforms. They were subsequently asked ‘between the WHO Tuberculosis Guidelines (current
 website), and the WHO eTB Guidelines (alternative website), which do you prefer?’. We mea-
 sured preference using a Likert-type scale to express the degree of preference with seven
 answer options (1 = strongly prefer WHO TB, 2 = prefer WHO TB, 3 = somewhat prefer
 WHO TB, 4 = same preference for WHO TB and eTB, 5 = somewhat prefer WHO eTB, 6 = pre-
 fer WHO eTB, 7 = strongly prefer WHO eTB).
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> For this two-sided (a ¼ 0:05Þ superiority analysis, sample size was calculated using the pri-
 mary outcome of accessibility in WINPEPI (PEPI-for-Windows) version 11.65. With a sample
 size of 122 per arm (244 total) we would achieve 80% power to detect a difference on the
 Likert-scale of 0.5 with a standard deviation of 1.0 between intervention and control groups,
 generally considered an important change on the seven-point Likert scale and observed in pre-
 vious studies measuring on GRADE SoF tables [9–13]. We assumed that 15% of those starting
 would not complete the survey, but we did not factor stratifying participants by stakeholder
 group into the calculation, as the aim of stratification was to balance participants rather than
 be sufficiently powered to detect subgroup effects.
 We summarized participant baseline characteristics and outcomes using means and stan-
 dard deviations (SD) for continuous variables, and proportions for categorical variables. We
 performed a primary analysis including all randomised participants, except for those who
 completed the survey in less than five minutes. We determined this cut-off a priori as part of
 the protocol because user testing determined that it would be impossible to comprehend and
 complete the work in that time. We conducted a second per-protocol analysis excluding par-
 ticipants who were flagged by pre-defined but unknown SurveyMonkey software for poor-
 quality responses known as straight-lining. Straight-lining is defined by SurveyMonkey as
 responses to questions with the same answer option or pattern. Participants flagged for
 straight-lining, as well as those who spent less than five minutes on the survey, were removed
 from the per-protocol analysis.
 For the outcomes of accessibility and satisfaction, we used t-tests and mean differences 95%
 confidence intervals (95% CIs) to compare means and standard deviations (SDs) between the
 intervention and control groups. For the outcome of understanding, we used w 2 tests and risk
 difference (RD) with 95% CIs to compare the proportion of correct responses between groups. 
<section> For preference, we presented preference as mean (SD) overall and for both trial arms. Skew-
 ness, Shapiro-Wilk tests, and histograms were used to evaluate whether the distribution was
 shifted toward the same preference in both groups. Levene’s test of equal variances was used
 for all t-tests and degrees of freedom were adjusted for p < 0.05. We conducted the analyses
 using IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version
 We performed a pre-planned interim analysis with data collected between February 26 and
 March 24, 2021, based on the thesis defence date of the first author (MM). The interim analysis
 was not intended or used to stop the study or draw final conclusions (S3 File).
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Between February 26 and August 29, 2021, 478 participants enrolled in the study. Of these,
 dropped out prior to randomisation and 42 did not satisfy the eligibility criteria. A total of
 participants were randomised. Of these, 16 were removed for less than five-minute completion
 time, leaving 244 for the primary analysis. In this sample, 48% (117/244) were female, 91%
 (223/244) were between the ages of 26 and 65, 63% (153/244) worked or lived in a low-and mid-
 dle-income country (LMIC), 26% (63/244) in a high-income country (HIC), and 11% (26/244)
 in both. Most participants (79%; 193/244) held a professional or graduate degree, and at least
 three years (77%; 189/244) of TB-related work experience. Most participants also considered
 themselves to be comfortable (26%; 64/244) or very comfortable (56%; 136/244) with basic
 information and communication technologies. Participant strata comprised of 7% (16/244) in
 the patient group, 25% (62/244) in the healthcare provider group, 36% (89/244) in the policy-
 maker group, and 32% (77/244) in the academic group. We found no differences in study out-
 comes between strata on stakeholder roles, so Table 2 describes non-stratified data per group.
 Across four domains, participants assigned to the new WHO eTB RecMap rated the infor-
 mation as more accessible compared to the conventional WHO TB website (MD on the seven-
 point scale: 0�9; 95% CI: 0�6, 1�2; p < 0.001). The largest mean differences were observed for
 the statements “it was easy to find the information” (MD 1.1; 95% CI: 0.7, 1.5; p < 0.001) and
 “this website was easy to navigate” (MD 1.3; 95% CI: 0.9, 1.7; p < 0�001). Participants assigned
 to WHO eTB also stated that it was easier to understand the information (MD 0.6; 95% CI:
 0.3, 0.9; p = 0.001) and that the information was presented in a way that would help them
 make a decision (MD 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3, 1.0; p < 0.001, Table 3).
 Participants assigned to the WHO eTB were more likely to correctly answer understanding
 questions: risk difference of 47% (95% CI 37, 57; p < 0.001, Table 4) for correct responses to
 the EtD question. There were also 20% differences (95% CI 8, 32) in correct responses to ques-
 tions on recommendations strength (p = 0.002) and certainty of evidence (p = 0.001).
 Participants assigned to WHO eTB were more satisfied with the presentation of the home
 page (MD 1.0; 95% CI: 0.7, 1.4; p < 0.001, Table 5) and individual recommendations page
 (MD 0.3; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.6; p = 0.048) compared to WHO TB. We observed that participants
 assigned to WHO eTB also appeared more satisfied with the list of recommendations page, but
 the difference was smaller than for the other outcomes (MD 0.2; 95% CI: -0.1, 0.5; p = 0.214).
 Overall, participants (n = 234) “somewhat preferred WHO eTB” (4.8; SD 1.8), after review-
 ing demonstrations of both platforms. This preference was stronger in participants who were
 assigned to first review the WHO eTB (5.0; SD 1.6) compared to those who first reviewed the
 WHO TB (4.5; SD 2.0) (p = 0.044) platform. Both arms were left-skewed toward this prefer-
 ence (p < 0.001).
 There were no differences between the primary and per-protocol analyses that excluded
 participants suspected of straight lining (responses to questions with the same answer option
 or pattern) (n = 227) (S3 File).

<section> Discussion
 
<section> The primary aim of this RCT was to determine if the WHO eTB RecMap [6,7] improved the
 usability of WHO TB recommendations for stakeholders of interest. Participants represented
 diverse group of users and potential users of TB recommendations. Our results suggest that
 the WHO eTB RecMap improves the usability of these recommendations for stakeholders
 when compared to the conventional method. Specifically, participants found, on average, that
 the information presented in WHO eTB was easier to find, easier to understand, that it was

<section> presented in a way that would help them make a decision, and that the website was easier to
 navigate. We sought to corroborate accessibility with the secondary outcome of understand-
 ing, and we found that the eTB RecMap improved the ability of participants to identify recom-
 mendation strength and certainty, and to access the supporting evidence and decisions
 underpinning the recommendation (EtD). Furthermore, stakeholders were more satisfied
 with the presentation of the WHO eTB home page and presentation of individual recommen-
 dations, although the effects were small. Overall, participants somewhat preferred the eTB
 RecMap to the conventional WHO TB website.
 To our knowledge, this is the first RCT comparing stakeholder feedback on the presenta-
 tion of two guideline platforms. However, several studies have explored stakeholder percep-
 tions of guideline development and presentation, as well as the factors that influence their
 uptake. One qualitative study by Fearns, et al. [14] explored public perceptions of clinical prac-
 tice guidelines and found that participants desired information to help them make decisions,
 but current numerical formats may not always be accessible to a public audience. Additionally,
 a content analysis by Santesso, et al. [15] found that patient versions of guidelines may not
 always address stakeholder needs, as they rarely include important EtD information, such as
 beliefs, values and preferences, accessibility, costs and feasibility. Furthermore, a realist review
 by Kastiner, et al. [16] which sought to identify the factors associated with guideline uptake,

<section> found that effective communication of content, including simple, clear and persuasive lan-
 guage, improved the implementability of guidelines by stakeholders.
 This trial expands on the methods of previous RCTs used to evaluate the presentation of
 guideline information, specifically, comparing new GRADE SoF tables to conventional for-
 mats. These studies also evaluated the outcomes of participant understanding, accessibility,
 satisfaction and preference [9,11,12]. Akl, et al. [17] found that participants demonstrated a
 better understanding of strength of recommendations and quality of evidence when this infor-
 mation was presented as symbols, rather than numbers. Carrasco-Labra, et al. [9] and Vand-
 vik, et al. [12] identified that stakeholders preferred the presentation of risk differences over
 absolute risk estimates, as well as the inclusion of narrative statements to supplement numeri-
 cal data. Similar, to our trial, these studies objectively evaluated perceptions of new to conven-
 tional formats to identify areas of improvement.
 This study had several strengths. First, we used a randomised design reported in accordance
 with the CONSORT statement on randomised trials, which reduces the risk of confounding,
 selection and reporting bias (S1 Table) [18,19]. Second, we used several previously validated
 outcomes from similar trials [9–12]. Third, we gathered feedback from diverse group of stake-
 holders, thus improving the generalizability of findings using a carefully developed approach
 to presenting recommendations [6]. Nevertheless, the snowball recruitment strategy through
 established guideline networks may limit the generalizability in potential users. This study has
 some additional limitations. First, the ability to blind participants was limited, as some may
 have been aware of eTB development. We consider this probability to be small, as the main
 publication and awareness campaigns began after the majority of participants had been
 recruited. Our pre-planned a priori interim analysis that coincided with publication of the eTB
 platform did not suggest differences in the results before and after these campaigns (S3 File).
 Second, data were collected using an online survey and, thus, there was limited control over
 the environment in which the survey was performed. Third, participants often claimed to be
 part of more than one stakeholder group (e.g., a healthcare provider involved in research), but
 they were required to select just one for stratification. Fourth, we did not power our trial to
 conclusively evaluate results by participant strata. Fifth, some of the secondary outcomes
 showed mean effects that were below the minimal important difference (MID) although the
 of the effects crossed the MID. Despite these small effects, a proportion of users would still
 experience benefit from the eTB platform presentation related to these secondary outcomes
 [20]. Furthermore, to improve the presentation on the eTB platform, we have made additional
 changes to the final presentation on the eTB RecMap and our new eCOVID RecMap that cata-
 logues recommendations related to COVID-19 guidelines [21]. 
<section> Tuberculosis guideline recommendations developed by the WHO assist stakeholders in
 making evidence-informed decisions on TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care [2,3].
 According to the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N) and the National Institute for
 Health and Care Excellence (NICE), stakeholder engagement is important to ensuring that
 guideline products are feasible and acceptable to end-users [22,23]. This study engaged stake-
 holders in evaluating the presentation of recommendations through the outcomes of accessi-
 bility, understanding, and satisfaction, which are surrogates for the correct implementation
 evidence in practice. Thus, our findings suggest that the new WHO eTB RecMap will help
 stakeholders make evidence-informed decisions on TB in support of the WHO End TB strat-
 egy [2]. This study demonstrates that RCTs may be used to compare stakeholder feedback on
 guideline platforms. Future studies should seek to explain the findings of this trial through
 qualitative and user testing techniques, such as the study by Rosenbaum, et al. for SoF tables
 [10]. Furthermore, additional trials should focus on specific stakeholder groups, such as
 patients and the public, to determine optimal ways to present recommendations. There are
 three trials underway that test the use of plain language recommendations presented as part
 a recommendation map for COVID-19 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05358990).
 In conclusion, the new WHO eTB RecMap [6,7] improved the usability of WHO TB rec-
 ommendations and supporting evidence for stakeholders of interest. Our findings support the
 continued use, promotion, and quality improvement of WHO eTB. Researchers should con-
 sider the use of RCTs to evaluate stakeholder feedback on guideline presentation in the future.
 The RecMap approach has been used for COVID-19 (covid19.recmap.org and who.covid19.
 recmap.org) and is being implemented by the PanAmerican Health Organization across all
 guidelines that use the GRADE approach (https://bigg-rec.bvsalud.org/en). This trial provides
 some evidence that this may be a wise decision.
