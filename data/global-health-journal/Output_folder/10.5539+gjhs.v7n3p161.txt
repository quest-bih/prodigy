<section> Abstract
 
<section> Introduction: The present study aimed to assess the association between nutritional status and depressive
 symptoms among elderly Iranians and to explore their impact on their Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL).
 
<section> Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 447 elders aging from 55 to 85 years were randomly selected and
 completed the Iranian version of Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA),
 and the Iranian version of Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).
 
<section> Results: Out of the 447 elderly, 72.1% were female with the mean age of 65.99 ± 7.89 years. The prevalence of
 depression was 38.1%. In addition, the SF-36 sub-scores tended to be lower among the elders with depressive
 symptoms according to GDS. The Physical Functioning (PF), Bodily Pain (BP), Role Physical (RP), Role
 Emotional (RE), and Mental Health (MH) dimensions of the SF-36 were also statistically poorer in the elders
 with depression. The mean MNA score was 24.6 ± 2.7; 35.4% of the participants were malnourished or at risk of
 malnutrition and 64.6% were adequately nourished. The sub scores of SF-36 were significantly lower in the
 elders with impaired nutritional status.
 
<section> Conclusions: Considering the importance of the association among psychological and nutritional problems and
 HRQoL in caring for and promoting the welfare of the elders, this study provided fundamental information and a
 basis for further evaluation of this issue in developing and undeveloped countries.

<section> 1. Introduction
 
<section> Aging is an unavoidable process of every living organism and is related to a reduction in the homeostatic control
 and reserve capacity of the organ systems, the capability to adapt to the environmental factors, and the capacity
 of a stress response. In addition to being an unavoidable physiologic process, aging is one of the most important
 causes of decrease in life quality due to its chronologic, biological, social, and psychological dimensions (DeLisa
 et al., 2005; Power et al., 1998). Assessment of quality of life has played an important role in development of
 health services (Keshavarzi et al., 2012; Klassen et al., 1996). Depression is the most frequent health problem in
 aged individuals that may significantly affect their quality of life (Blazer, 2003). Epidemiological studies have
 indicated the prevalence rates of depression in free living elderly to range from 10% to 15%, and it can reach up
 to 45% in institutionalized individuals (Jongenelis et al., 2004; Webber et al., 2005; Teresi et al., 2001). It is
 commonly observed that depressed elderly patients are more likely to have worse general health along with a
 significant decrease in their quality of life (Shmuely et al., 2001).
 
<section> The other common problem in late life is malnutrition with the prevalence rate of up to 60% in the
 institutionalized elders. Malnutrition has serious unfavorable effects on health and one of its correctable causes is
 depression (Vellas et al., 2001; Saletti et al., 2000; Suominen et al., 2005). In other words, a reduced energy
 intake causing body weight loss may be caused by social or physiological factors or a combination of both.
 Depression in the elderly can often lead to malnutrition or dehydration which in turn can induce various kinds of
 physical illnesses. On the other hand, physical conditions, such as malnutrition, in the elderly can induce
 depression because of their psychological vulnerability. Due to the strong relationship between the body and the
 mind in the elderly, psychiatric care seems to be necessary (Wada, 2000). One of the most common causes of 
<section> depression which leads to psychological issues and malnutrition in the elderly is related to the experience of loss
 or breakage of social networks (Pirlich & Lochs, 2001; Chapman, 2006; Cederholm & Hellström, 1995; Donini
 et al., 2003). Several studies have indicated that depression was a major factor contributing to weight loss in the
 elderly and malnourished patients had higher depression scores (Morley & Kraenzle 1994; Blaum et al., 1995).
 However, the casual relationship between depression and nutritional status is still unclear (Singh et al., 2014).
 
<section> A higher prevalence of untreated depression, malnutrition, and disabilities in the elderly compared to other age
 groups and the subsequent limitations in their social activities negatively affect the quality of life and well-being
 and, consequently, can increase mortality. Currently, there is a growing number of research and increased clinical
 interest in developing robust quantitative measures of quality of life that can be used in clinical assessments and
 economic models. Moreover, the increase in the elderly population makes it necessary to investigate the
 characteristics of depression whose presence adversely affects the social interaction and may cause malnutrition,
 decrease the quality of life, cause pain and discomfort, and have a significant economic impact due to the
 significantly high treatment costs (Bergquist & Frantz, 2001).
 
<section> In public health and medicine, the concept of quality of life refers to an individual’s perception of happiness and
 satisfaction with life and position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in
 relation to their expectations, values, and concerns (Power et al., 1998). The impacts of depression and
 malnutrition on the quality of life should be assessed and monitored. Instruments that assess Health-Related
 Quality of Life (HRQoL) measure the degree to which functional, physical, mental, and social aspects are
 impaired by symptoms, incapacities, and limitations caused by diseases (Hazzard et al., 2003). HRQoL can be
 measured by either generic or specific instruments that, for the most part, were originally developed in English
 language, translated into other languages, and validated for different cultures (McDowell et al., 2006; Ware Jr &
 Gandek, 1998). The SF-36 questionnaire (Medical Outcomes Trust, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) was
 translated and validated in Iran by Montazeri et al., (2005) in a population-based study on 4163 healthy
 individuals aging 15 years and above (Montazeri et al., 2005). It was considered as an appropriate instrument
 with regard to the socioeconomic and cultural characteristics of the study population. This instrument measures
 several dimensions of health and assesses the impact of diseases and the benefits of treatment. It is a generic
 HRQoL instrument composed of 36 items organized into eight health concepts, including physical function,
 social and psychological factors, life satisfaction, well-being, and awareness of health status (McDowell et al.,
 2006; Ware Jr & Gandek, 1998).
 
<section> The impact of nutrition on health and functional status of the elderly is well-known and studies in hospitalized
 and community dwelling elderly have shown that depression increased the risk of impaired nutritional status.
 However, there exists little information on these disorders among the elders in the community and their impact
 on the quality of life of this population especially in developing countries. Moreover, health maintenance and
 improvement in quality of life in the elderly population can be possible by implementation of recommendations
 based on scientific research. Thus, the present study aims to assess the nutritional status and the prevalence of
 depression and examine the association between these health-related problems and quality of life in the elders
 using SF-36. Furthermore, the effects of socio-demographic, medical, and emotional factors on the participants'
 quality of life were evaluated through a cross-sectional assessment. Our hypothesis was that the presence of
 depressive symptoms and malnutrition would have a significant negative impact on HRQoL.
 
<section> 2. Materials and Methods
 
<section> A total of 447 non-institutionalized individuals above 55 years of age were recruited into the present study. In
 general, old age is defined according to a range of characteristics, including chronological age, change in social
 role, and changes in functional abilities. In high-resourced countries, old age is generally defined in relation to
 retirement from paid employment and receipt of a pension at 60 or 65 years of age. With increase in longevity,
 some countries have defined a separate group of the oldest people; i.e., those over 85 years old. In low-resourced
 situations with shorter life-spans, old people may be defined as those over 50 years of age. The age of 50 years
 was accepted as the definition of old people for the purpose of WHO Older Adult Health and Ageing in Africa
 project (WHO, 2010).
 
<section> In the present study, the subjects were selected using two-stage cluster sampling. All the subjects signed written
 informed consents and the study was approved by the local Ethics Committee.
 
<section> The study data were collected using Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), the Iranian version of Geriatric
 Depression Scale-15 (GDS), and the Iranian version of Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).
 
<section> MNA is a valid instrument which can be used for identifying the geriatric patients who are malnourished or at
 risk of malnutrition (Barone et al., 2003). It is both a screening and assessment instrument for determination of 
<section> malnutrition in the elderly. This instrument eliminates the need for more invasive tests, such as blood sampling.
 It consists of items regarding general condition, appetite, anthropometry, food preference, and subjective
 perception of health status. In case a patient gains 12 points or more in the screening part of MNA, s/he is not at
 risk and is not required to complete the rest of the questionnaire (for collecting more data in the present study,
 the questionnaire was filled out completely). On the other hand, if a patient obtains 11 points or less, s/he may be
 at risk and the whole MNA should be completed. Based on the final scores, the study patients were categorized
 into three groups: scores below 17 (malnutrition), scores between 17 and 23.9 (at risk of malnutrition), and
 scores between 24 and 30 (well nourished).
 
<section> At the study center, the participants who were instructed to wear no shoes and light clothing had their weight (kg)
 and height (cm) measured to the nearest decimal using a Jenix DS-102 stadiometer (Dong Sahn Jenix Co., Ltd.,
 Seoul, Korea). In addition, Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2).
 
<section> GDS is a screening tool to identify the elderly patients who are at risk of depression. This screening instrument
 includes 30 yes/no items evaluating the level of depressive symptoms within the last week. This self-estimated
 scale was developed by Yesa-vage et al., (Yesavage et al., 1983) and the validity and reliability of its Persian
 version have been confirmed (Malakouti et al., 2006). In this scale, high scores indicate a high level of
 depressive symptoms. According to GDS, in case a patient gains 8 points or less, s/he is not at risk (Yesavage et
 al., 1983).
 
<section> In this study, HRQoL was evaluated using the Iranian version of SF-36 questionnaire (Montazeri et al., 2005).
 This questionnaire consists of 8 subscales namely Physical Functioning (PF), Role Physical (RP), Bodily Pain
 (BP), General Health (GH), Vitality (VT), Social Functioning (SF), Role Emotional (RE), and Mental Health
 (MH). PF, RP, and BP subscales measure physical limitations in daily life resulting from decreased functional
 status and pain. In addition, VT and GH represent the personal perception of the global health status. Finally, SF,
 RE, and MH evaluate anxiety as well as the effect of emotional problems on daily life and social contacts. The
 scores of this instrument range from 0 to 100 for each subscale, with higher scores representing a more desirable
 state. These scales range from 0-100 percent (absolute values), while the norm values differ substantially across
 the scales. Thus, to facilitate the interpretation and to compare the results with the norm values obtained in 1998
 (1998 SF-36 US population norms), all the scales were not only expressed as absolute values, but also as
 norm-based scores. This means that each scale was scored to have the same mean and standard deviation. In the
 current study, the standard (US) scoring algorithms were used as recommended by Ware et al., (1998). Hence,
 the results of the eight scales can directly be compared because they are all standardized relative to the
 population norms.
 
<section> In this study, all the questionnaires were administered through face to face interviews. The interviewers were
 trained and calibrated. Admission and data analysis was followed by examining the relationship between
 malnutrition and depression as well as education, gender, working status (employed, unemployed, and retired),
 BMI, and doing exercise. The effects of MNA and GDS scores and also some socio-demographic variables (such
 as education, gender, and working status) on the elders’ quality of life were investigated, as well.
 All the statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS statistical software (version19; SPSS Inc., Chicago,
 IL, USA). Normal distribution of the variables was assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The results of
 descriptive statistics were expressed as means ± SDs for continuous variables and as frequencies and percentages
 for categorical variables. The subjects with and without depression or malnutrition were compared by Chi-square
 test for categorical variables, including gender and years of education, and independent sample t-tests for
 continuous variables, such as different subscales of HRQoL. Moreover, Pearson correlation coefficients were
 calculated for the linear relations between the subscales of HRQoL and continuous variables, such as MNA
 scores, GDS score, and the measures of BMI. In order to identify the factors affecting the subjects’ quality of life,
 a two-step regression analysis with adjustment of the possible confounding effects was conducted for each SF-36
 subscale. Univariate analyses were initially performed and the variables that reached a value of P<0.15 were
 considered as the potential factors and incorporated into the second phase of the multivariate analysis to identify
 the factors associated with SF-36 scores. Besides, a two-sided P-value<0.05 was considered as statistically
 significant.

 depressed and non-depressed elderly regarding age, gender, years of education, working status, regular
 exercising, and MNA score. Moreover, the prevalence of depression was higher in females compared to males.
 Also, the subjects with depressive symptoms had a significantly worse nutritional status, lower level of education,

 Comparison of the mean scores of the 8 domains of SF-36 in the elders with and without depressive symptoms
 showed that the depressed elders’ HRQoL was significantly lower in RP, PF, BP, RE, and MH domains.
 Considering other dimensions, however, no significant difference was observed between the depressed and
 normal elders regarding their SF-36 scores (Table 3). We also compared the mean scores of SF-36 in the elders
 with and without malnutrition. According to the results, the elders who were malnourished or at risk of
 malnutrition had significantly worse HRQoL compared to the well-nourished elders in all the SF-36 domains,
 except for SF (Table 4).

 Linear regression analyses identifying the factors associated with different subscales of HRQoL have been
 presented in Table 5. In summary, the results showed that after adjustment for other variables, the effects of
 depressive symptoms persisted for 4 domains of SF-36; i.e., PF, BP, RE, and MH (P<0.05). Another important
 factor that had a negative effect on HRQoL was “nutritional status”. In comparison to the well-nourished elders,
 those who were malnourished or at risk of malnutrition had significantly worse HRQoL in the following domains:
 PF (P<0.05), RP (P<0.05), and VT (P<0.05). In addition, being unemployed had a significantly negative effect
 on VT (P<0.01) and higher age had a significantly negative effect on PF (P<0.001). Furthermore, male gender
 had a negative effect on PF (P<0.05) but a positive effect on VT (P<0.05). Another important factor that had a
 positive effect on HRQoL was “regular exercising”. In comparison to the elders who never exercised, those who
 exercised regularly had significantly better PF (P<0.05). However, with regards to the years of education and
 BMI, no significant effect was seen on the HRQoL subscales.

<section> 4. Discussion
 
<section> HRQoL has received increasing interest in epidemiology and health outcomes research recently. In the present
 study, we investigated the quality of life of 447 elders in relation to their evaluated GDS scores and their
 nutritional status. Our findings showed that both malnutrition and depressive symptoms were highly prevalent
 among the geriatric population. The large number of the individuals identified as malnourished or at nutritional
 risk is in concordance with the literature as is the number of the participants with depressive symptoms
 (Kvamme et al., 2011; Ahmadi et al., 2013; Eriksson et al., 2005; Norman et al., 2006; Smoliner et al., 2009)
 The findings of the current study showed that HRQoL was significantly reduced in the individuals with impaired
 nutritional status. Moreover, the perception of physical ability and various components of quality of life were
 impaired in the participants with depressive symptoms. As expected, the elderly individuals who reported
 depression presented HRQoL that was affected by all the subscales, except for VT, GH, and SF. The HRQoL of
 the elders suffering from depression was most evident on the RE, BP, and PF subscales. The damaging effect of
 emotional status was profound, and the fact that emotional condition significantly affected bodily pain was
 noteworthy, as well. Pihl et al., also found that among the elderly patients suffering from depression, the greatest
 losses were in the PF, BP, and GH areas (Pihl et al., 2005). On the other hand, Smoliner et al., reported the
 largest differences in RP and MH (Norman et al., 2006). Thus, providing the depressed elderly patients with
 adequate care can help reduce suffering as well as its impacts on the quality of life.
 
<section> In comparison to the well-nourished elders, those who were malnourished or at risk of malnutrition experienced
 a significantly lower quality of life scores, particularly in PF and RP scales. Of course, our findings regarding the
 poorer HRQoL among the elders with malnutrition or risk of malnutrition compared to the well-nourished ones
 were not unexpected. Other studies have also shown these subscales as the most affected ones among the
 patients with malnutrition (Kvamme et al., 2011; Ahmadi et al., 2013; Eriksson et al., 2005; Norman et al., 2006).
 Norman et al., found the greatest reductions to be in the RP, MH, and VT subscales (Norman et al., 2006). In
 Berlin, Smoliner et al., studied 114 residents of a nursing home and found the lowest means of the SF-36 values
 in GH and VT. On the other hand, Verma et al., reported the greatest reductions in MH and RE (Smoliner et al.,
 
<section> 2009; Pihl et al., 2005).
 
<section> It has been well documented that HRQoL in general population was influenced by socio demographic factors,
 such as age, gender, education level, physical activity, and marital status. Fewer problems on the descriptive
 system and higher scores in the subscales of HRQoL were most prevalent among the subjects who were younger,
 male, had higher education levels, were married, and did exercise (Quercioli et al., 2009; Cherepanov et al.,
 2010). Not surprisingly, our study findings revealed better PF among the younger patients compared to the older
 ones. It was also not surprising to find a positive association between regular exercising and the PF domain of
 HRQoL. However, by far the most significant negative impact on all the subscales of HRQoL was due to the
 presence of depressive symptoms and malnutrition. Similar findings have been reported in the previous studies,
 as well (Kvamme et al., 2011; Ahmadi et al., 2013; Eriksson et al., 2005; Norman et al., 2006; Smoliner et al.,
 2009; Pihl et al., 2005; Verma et al., 2010).
 
<section> The results of the current study emphasized the need for better organization of quality in healthcare services for
 the chronic conditions in the elderly. In fact, such improvements can help prevent the complications of these
 diseases. Hence, healthcare services should become more effective in management of the disorders, such as
 depression and malnutrition, which lead to various disorders that have a negative effect on autonomy and
 wellbeing. Moreover, the high prevalence of depression and malnutrition which are inevitable components of the
 aging process requires improvements and adjustments in prevention, control, and treatment procedures.
 Furthermore, along with the adequate medical care for the elderly patients, screening programs should also be
 established for early diagnosis of the aforementioned conditions. Besides, patients should be monitored regularly
 after diagnosis for treatment compliance. Of course, health disparities should be offset by paying more attention
 to the elderly with lower socioeconomic statuses.
 
<section> The importance of the present study comes from the fact that it is the first study on the Iranian elders quantifying
 the impact of depression, malnutrition, and a number of socio-demographic conditions on the eight areas of
 HRQoL assessed by SF-36. The study results were similar to those obtained in other countries, and there is
 general agreement regarding the mostly affected subscales.
 
<section> This study had some limitations. One of the limitations of the present study was that no inference could be made
 regarding the causal relationship among nutritional status, depression, and quality of life because the study
 followed a cross-sectional design. Yet, the study findings draw our attention to the fact that HRQoL that looks at
 health from an individual’s perspective is truly multi-faceted, and simple measures to detect and treat depression 
<section> can go a long way towards reducing the burden of malnutrition and disability. Further studies are needed to
 identify the direction of this relationship and to assess the effect of depression treatment on nutritional status as
 well as on HRQoL.
 
<section> 5. Conclusion
 
<section> Overall, the findings of the present study revealed the need for interventions that consider the effect of
 depression and malnutrition on different dimensions of HRQoL, with particular attention to the elders. Moreover,
 the effect of such disorders on HRQoL subscales should be evaluated occasionally in order to assess the
 improvements in healthcare and social services for the elderly individuals.
