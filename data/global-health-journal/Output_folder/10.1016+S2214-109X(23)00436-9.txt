<section> Summary
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> Background—Alcohol use is common among people with HIV and is a risk factor for
 tuberculosis disease and non-adherence to isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT). Few interventions
 exist to reduce alcohol use and increase IPT adherence in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this
 study was to test the hypothesis that financial incentives conditional on point-of-care negative
 urine alcohol biomarker testing and positive urine isoniazid testing would reduce alcohol use
 and increase isoniazid adherence, respectively, in people with HIV who have latent tuberculosis
 infection and hazardous alcohol use.
 
<section> Methods—We conducted an open-label, 2×2 factorial randomised controlled trial in Uganda.
 
<section> Author Eligible for the study were non-pregnant HIV-positive adults (aged ≥18 years) prescribed
 antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months, with current heavy alcohol use confirmed by urine
 ethyl glucuronide (biomarker of recent alcohol use) and a positive Alcohol Use Disorders
 
<section> Manuscript Identification Test—Consumption (AUDIT-C; ≥3 for women, ≥4 for men) for the past 3 months’
 drinking, no history of active tuberculosis, tuberculosis treatment, or tuberculosis preventive
 therapy, and a positive tuberculin skin test. We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1:1) initiating
 6 months of IPT to: no incentives (group 1); or incentives for recent alcohol abstinence (group
 2), isoniazid adherence (group 3), or both (group 4). Escalating incentives were contingent on
 monthly point-of-care urine tests negative for ethyl glucuronide (groups 2 and 4), or positive on
 IsoScreen (biomarker of recent isoniazid use; groups 3 and 4). The primary alcohol outcome was
 non-hazardous use by self-report (AUDIT-C <3 for women, <4 for men) and phosphatidylethanol
 (PEth; past-month alcohol biomarker) <35 ng/mL at 3 months and 6 months. The primary

 However, a typical contingency management model is not feasible in many resource-limited
 settings, given the high frequency of clinic visits required (eg, twice per week) in settings
 where direct (eg, travel) and indirect (eg, time away from work) costs of attending clinic
 are expensive. The effectiveness of pragmatic modifications to contingency management that
 use incentive-based approaches for alcohol use, but with less frequent visits and rewards
 to enhance feasibility, is unknown. Furthermore, contingency management relies on an

 a challenge for offering incentives conditional on isoniazid adherence. Whether incentive-

 point-of-care negative urine alcohol biomarker testing and positive urine isoniazid testing
 would reduce alcohol use and increase isoniazid adherence, respectively, among adults with
 HIV–tuberculosis co-infection and hazardous alcohol use.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Study design and participants
 The Drinkers’ Intervention to Prevent Tuberculosis trial is a 2 × 2 factorial randomised
 
<section> Manuscript controlled trial among adults with HIV and latent tuberculosis infection, and hazardous
 alcohol use in southwestern Uganda. We conducted the trial at two rural and two urban
 clinics. We also screened participants at 15 lower-level satellite clinics, with referral to the
 four study clinics for enrolment and study visits. We previously published the study design,
 procedures, and outcome measures, 14 and include the protocol in appendix 2 (p 16). 
<section> We first screened people with HIV attending clinic appointments at study sites to identify
 
<section> Author those reporting any current (past 3 months) alcohol use. Once we identified patients with
 any alcohol use, study staff obtained written consent to participate in screening for trial
 eligibility. Participants were eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria at screening:
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> adults (aged ≥18 years) with HIV prescribed ART for at least 6 months; current hazardous
 alcohol use confirmed by ethyl glucuronide (EtG), a metabolite of alcohol use that can be
 detected in urine for several days, using a commercial point-of-care dipstick test (Confirm
 Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) with a detection cutoff (indicating alcohol use in the past
 48 h) of 300 ng/mL, 
<section> 15 and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test—Consumption
 (AUDIT-C; ≥3 for women, ≥4 for men), 
<section> 16 modified for the past 3 months’ drinking; no
 history of active tuberculosis, tuberculosis disease treatment, or tuberculosis preventive
 therapy; fluent in Runyankole (the local dialect in southwestern Uganda) or English;
 residence within 2 h driving distance or 60 km of the study site; aspartate aminotransferase
 
<section> Author (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than two times the upper limit of normal;
 and positive tuberculin skin test (TST), defined as 5 mm induration or larger. TSTs were
 only performed on participants who met all other eligibility criteria. Participants were
 
<section> Manuscript excluded if they had suspected or confirmed active tuberculosis (determined by symptom
 screening, followed by chest x-ray and sputum Xpert MTB/RIF assay [Cepheid, Sunnyvale,
 CA, USA] testing, if symptomatic); use of medications not recommended during IPT by
 Ugandan Ministry of Health guidelines, including nevirapine, anticonvulsants, or recent
 initiation (past 3 months) of dolutegravir; plans to move out of the study clinic catchment
 area within the next 6 months; pregnancy (by urine test) at the time of screening; or gross
 inebriation or inability to provide informed consent. Individuals with severe alcohol use
 disorder were not excluded, and with their consent, we notified their HIV providers (to
 whom we provided training in the management of alcohol use disorders before the start of
 
<section> Author the trial) about their level of alcohol use. Eligible individuals who provided written consent
 were enrolled in the trial.
 
<section> Manuscript The Mbarara University of Science and Technology Research and Ethics Committee, the
 Makerere University School of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee, the Uganda
 National Council for Science and Technology, and the University of California San
 Francisco Committee on Human Research approved the study protocol. Our institutional
 review board (IRB) applications noted that IPT is not recommended for individuals
 considered “regular and heavy drinkers” in resource-limited settings (such as Uganda) per
 WHO guidelines, and explicitly indicated that the trial would comprise individuals with
 heavy alcohol use. However, given that people who consume alcohol at hazardous levels
 are at increased risk of active tuberculosis and thus a high priority group for prevention,
 we received IRB approvals to provide IPT to participants with hazardous alcohol use with
 
<section> Author
 
<section> several specific precautions: (1) we excluded anyone with ALT or AST values of more than
 two times the upper limit of normal in pretreatment tests at baseline; (2) we implemented
 
<section> Manuscript frequent monitoring of ALT and AST (every 2 weeks for the first month of IPT, and then
 monthly); and (3) we increased the frequency of monitoring for those with grade 2 ALT
 or AST elevations or symptoms, and discontinued IPT for grade 3 or higher adverse events
 attributed to isoniazid. The trial was conducted with oversight from a data safety monitoring
 board. 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 
<section> Author
 
<section> We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1:1) initiating 6 months of IPT to: no incentives
 (group 1) or incentives contingent on no recent alcohol use (group 2), recent isoniazid
 adherence (group 3), or both (awarded independently, group 4). Randomisation was
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> stratified by sex (female vs male) and study site. We used permuted blocks with random
 block sizes of 4 and 8 with the allocation sequence computer-generated before trial
 initiation. Participants selected a preprinted scratch card from eight cards presented by
 study staff that revealed randomisation assignment when scratched by the participant, with
 replacement of each card taken with the next card in the sequence, to ensure transparency
 and engagement in the randomisation process. Although participants and staff were not
 masked to study assignment given the nature of the intervention, the investigators, including
 the lead study statistician (SL), remained masked to participant randomisation assignment
 until trial completion.

<section> Procedures
 
<section> Manuscript Before randomisation, participants completed a questionnaire and blood draw for HIV
 viral load (Xpert HIV-1 RNA assay; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), CD4 + cell count,
 and phosphatidylethanol (PEth; by dried blood spot) measurement. PEth assays were
 performed at the US Drug Testing Laboratory (Des Plaines, IL, USA) with a limit of
 quantification of 8 ng/mL for the 16:0/18:1 analog. 
<section> 17 Research assistants selected male
 or female on the research form. The baseline questionnaire included screening for self-
 reported other hazardous or illicit substance use in the past 3 months. In addition, we
 repeated these screening questions to evaluate emergent substance use at the 6-month study
 visit, midway through trial implementation (ie, for approximately half of participants).
 The study provided isoniazid 300 mg by mouth daily and pyridoxine 25 mg by mouth
 
<section> Author
 
<section> daily (with the option to increase to pyridoxine 50 mg by mouth daily, at study clinician
 discretion) for all participants at enrolment, with initial follow-up and refills at 2 weeks
 and 1 month post-randomisation, and monthly thereafter, for a 6-month course of IPT. In
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> all groups, participants had liver function testing and screening for isoniazid side-effects
 and symptoms of active tuberculosis at each study visit. We allowed participants up to
 9 months to complete a 6-month isoniazid course (180 tablets), to account for missed or
 late visits; incentives were only given over the first 6 months. During Uganda’s initial
 national COVID-19 lockdown, we halted study visits from April 1 to May 26, 2020, for
 180 participants, as participants could not travel to study clinics. Participants resumed study
 visits, including intervention procedures, after the lockdown. All participants received brief
 (5-min) alcohol counselling at their baseline visit, and transport reimbursement (≤40
 Uganda shillings [USh]; approximately US$11·40) to cover costs of travel for study visits.
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Participants assigned to the incentive groups provided a urine sample for group-appropriate
 testing at each refill visit. At these visits, they were given escalating financial incentives
 
<section> Manuscript contingent on point-of-care urine tests that were negative for EtG (groups 2 and 4), or
 positive on IsoScreen (GFC Diagnostics, Chipping Warden, UK), a biomarker of isoniazid
 use over the previous 1–3 days (groups 3 and 4; appendix 2 p 2). 
<section> 18 Participants assigned
 to alcohol reduction incentives who had a negative urine EtG test, and those assigned to
 isoniazid adherence incentives who had a positive urine isoniazid test, instantly won cash 
<section> prizes, with prize value determined by drawing one or more lottery scratch cards. Scratch
 
<section> Author cards revealed low-value, medium-value, and high-value cash prizes, valued at 5000 USh
 (US$1·50; low), 10 000 USh (US$2·85; medium), and 50 000 USh (US$14·30; high),
 with each card having at least a low-value prize. Probabilities of winning were 90% for
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> low-value, 7% for medium-value, and 3% for high-value prizes. The number of scratch
 cards awarded per participant increased by one card at each subsequent visit with a negative
 urine EtG or positive urine isoniazid test, thereby providing escalating prizes for sustained
 reductions in alcohol use or sustained isoniazid adherence. Escalating prizes were used
 based on previous studies demonstrating that escalating reinforcements maintain smoking
 abstinence longer than fixed reinforcements. 
<section> 19 If a participant had a positive urine EtG or
 negative urine isoniazid test, no cards were given, and the participant “reset” to drawing one
 card if meeting the incentive condition at the subsequent visit.
 
<section> Author If participants discontinued isoniazid due to toxicity or pregnancy, they remained in the
 study for follow-up monitoring. However, these participants were no longer eligible to
 receive isoniazid adherence incentives if in groups 3 or 4, but were still eligible to
 
<section> Manuscript receive alcohol reduction incentives (groups 2 and 4). In the isoniazid adherence group,
 all participants on isoniazid who returned to the clinic for their first visit after the 8-
 week COVID-19 lockdown (during which they could not obtain isoniazid refills) received
 incentives for adherence according to their escalating schedules, independent of urine
 isoniazid test results.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary alcohol outcome used to assess the alcohol intervention was non-hazardous
 use by AUDIT-C (<3 in women and <4 in men, in the past 3 months) and PEth below
 
<section> Author ng/mL at 3 months and 6 months post-enrolmentr. The PEth cutoff was chosen a priori based
 on a previously recommended cutoff for no or low alcohol use. 
<section> 20 The primary isoniazid
 adherence outcome used to assess the adherence intervention was more than 90% electronic
 
<section> Manuscript pill bottle cap opening (using medication event monitoring system [MEMS] caps [AARDEX
 Group, Seraing, Belgium]) of days isoniazid prescribed. Secondary outcomes included PEth
 and MEMS cap openings as continuous measures at 6 months, and isoniazid discontinuation
 due to grade 3 or higher hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity was defined as elevation of AST or
 ALT to at least five times the upper limit of normal (grade 3) or at least ten times the upper
 limit of normal (grade 4) or based on symptoms that met prespecified grade 3 or 4 criteria
 for hepatotoxicity.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> Author The trial sample size (n=680) was determined based on the a priori goal of detecting a 10–
 12% or greater difference in outcomes, comparing intervention to non-intervention groups
 (eg, groups 2 and 4 vs groups 1 and 3 for the alcohol intervention). We found that we
 
<section> Manuscript needed to enroll 680 participants (170 per group, 340 per intervention), assuming 10% loss
 to follow-up for both 3-month and 6-month visits. For a two-sided χ2 test with continuity
 correction and alpha=0·05, this sample size would have given our study 80% power to
 detect a 10% absolute difference in the alcohol intervention versus no alcohol intervention
 groups, assuming proportions of participants with non-hazardous drinking of 25% and 15%, 
<section> respectively. This sample size would have given our study 80% power to detect a 12%
 
<section> Author absolute difference in the isoniazid adherence versus no adherence intervention groups,
 assuming proportions with adherence of 62% and 50%, respectively.
 
<section> Manuscript For the alcohol outcome, we used a multivariable logistic regression model to estimate
 the effect of the alcohol intervention while adjusting for the adherence intervention and
 stratification randomisation factors (sex, study site). For the adherence outcome, we used
 a multivariable logistic regression model to estimate the effect of the isoniazid adherence
 intervention while adjusting for the alcohol intervention and stratification randomisation
 factors. For each model, we used the parameter estimates to predict the probability of the
 outcome under the intervention versus no intervention and obtain the adjusted absolute risk
 (proportions with outcome value=1) for intervention and no intervention, the risk difference
 (primary treatment effect measurement), and risk ratio, with 95% CIs and p values (two-
 
<section> Author sided, α=0·05; appendix 2 pp 5–15 [statistical analysis plan, also available online]). For
 both outcomes, we tested for effect modification by sex, very heavy alcohol use at baseline
 (AUDIT-C ≥6 or PEth ≥200 ng/mL [a PEth level that corresponds to approximately 4–
 
<section> Manuscript 5 drinks per day on a regular basis ]), and urban versus rural site, with p<0·10 being
 considered significant.
 
<section> For the secondary continuous PEth outcome, we log-transformed PEth, and fit a linear
 regression model, with adjustment for baseline log PEth, sex, site, and randomisation
 to isoniazid adherence incentives. When PEth was below the limit of quantification, we
 substituted 0 for log PEth. For the secondary continuous MEMS cap opening outcome, we
 fit a negative binomial model for the number of MEMS cap opening days with an offset term
 defined as the natural logarithm of number of days of follow-up (given different follow-up
 times due to isoniazid discontinuation), adjusting for sex, site, and randomisation to alcohol

<section> reduction incentives.
 
<section> For the hepatotoxicity outcome, we used a logistic regression model including study group

<section> and randomisation stratification factors (sex, study site). We conducted three pairwise
 comparisons between groups 2, 3, and 4 versus control (group 1).

<section> Results
 
<section> From April 16, 2018, to Aug 2, 2021, 5508 people with HIV underwent initial screening
 for eligibility: 1812 (33%) met eligibility for TST placement. Of individuals screened by
 TST, 712 (39%) tested TST positive, of whom 680 (96%) enrolled in the trial. Reasons for
 non-enrolment are shown in figure 1. At baseline, participant median age was 39 years (IQR 
<section> 32–47), 470 (69%) were male, 598 (90%) of 663 had an HIV viral load below 40 copies per
 
<section> Author mL, median AUDIT-C was 6 (IQR 4–8), and median PEth was 252 ng/mL (IQR 87–579). At
 baseline, 181 (27%) of 680 participants reported smoking cigarettes, 22 (3%) used chewing
 tobacco, two (0·3%) used e-cigarettes, 46 (7%) used khat, 17 (3%) used marijuana, 11 (2%)
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> used kuba, two (0·3%) sniffed petrol, and no participants reported use of cocaine, heroin,
 speed (methamphetamine), or hookah. Baseline characteristics of participants are shown
 in table 1. Participants with study visits impacted by the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown were
 evenly distributed by group (appendix 2 p 3).
 
<section> There were 636 (94%) participants who had self-report and PEth data measured at
 months and 6 months post-enrolment and for whom the primary alcohol use outcome (ie,
 reduction in drinking to non-hazardous use) could be evaluated (figure 1). The proportion
 of participants with non-hazardous alcohol use was 17·6% (57 of 323) in the alcohol
 
<section> Author reduction incentives groups (groups 2 and 4) and 9·9% (31 of 313) in the groups without
 alcohol reduction incentives (groups 1 and 3): adjusted risk difference (aRD) 7·6% (95%
 CI 2·7–12·5; p=0·0025, adjusting for sex, study site, and adherence intervention; figure
 
<section> Manuscript 2). The number needed to treat with this intervention is 13·2 people for one person to
 reduce their alcohol use to non-hazardous levels. In a prespecified sensitivity analysis in
 which we assumed that the 44 participants with missing primary alcohol use endpoint
 data continued to have hazardous alcohol use (ie, did not meet the primary outcome),
 the effect of the alcohol intervention remained significant (aRD 7·1% [95% CI 2·5–11·8];
 p=0·0027). Prespecified subgroup analyses evaluating the effect of the alcohol intervention
 on the primary alcohol outcome by sex, rural versus urban site, and very heavy alcohol
 use at baseline are shown in table 2. The proportions of participants with non-hazardous
 alcohol use were higher in the alcohol intervention versus no alcohol intervention groups
 in all subgroups, particularly for women, urban participants, and those with lower baseline
 
<section> Author
 
<section> PEth levels. In a post-hoc analysis that reanalysed the primary alcohol outcome while
 adjusting for log PEth at baseline to account for higher baseline PEth level in group 1,
 
<section> Manuscript non-hazardous alcohol use remained significantly more likely in the alcohol intervention
 versus no intervention groups.
 
<section> Median PEth measured at 6 months post-enrolment (n=645 participants) was 134·0 ng/mL
 (IQR 25·0–379·0) in the alcohol intervention versus 170·5 ng/mL (58·5–483·5) in the
 no alcohol intervention groups. In a linear regression model evaluating PEth (log
 transformed) at 6 months post-enrolment, the alcohol intervention was associated with
 lower PEth levels (β=–0·08 [95% CI −0·18 to 0·01]; p=0·084) after adjusting for sex, site,
 randomisation to incentives for isoniazid adherence, and log PEth at baseline, but this
 finding did not meet statistical significance. Among the subset of 286 participants who
 
<section> Author underwent repeat screening for other substance use at 6 months post-randomisation, 57
 (20%) reported smoking cigarettes, one (0·3%) used chewing tobacco, five (2%) used khat,
 six (2%) used marijuana, one (0·3%) used kuba, and no participants reported use of cocaine,
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> heroin, speed (methamphetamine), hookah, sniffing petrol, or e-cigarettes.
 
<section> For the primary isoniazid adherence outcome, 656 (96%) participants had data on isoniazid
 adherence by MEMS cap opening. The proportion of participants with more than 90%
 adherence by MEMS cap openings during IPT was 72·8% (244 of 335) in the isoniazid 
<section> incentive groups (groups 3 and 4) and 72·9% (234 of 321) in the no isoniazid incentive
 
<section> Author groups (groups 1 and 2): aRD −0·2% (95% CI −7·0 to 6·5; p=0·94, adjusting for sex, site,
 and participation in the alcohol intervention; figure 2). There was no independent effect of
 the alcohol incentives intervention on the isoniazid adherence endpoint. In a prespecified
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> sensitivity analysis in which we assumed that the 24 participants with missing isoniazid
 adherence endpoint data did not achieve more than 90% adherence (ie, did not meet the
 primary adherence outcome), the effect of the isoniazid adherence intervention remained
 non-significant (aRD 0·2% [95% CI −4·8 to 8·9]; p=0·56). In subgroup analyses of the
 primary isoniazid adherence outcome by sex, baseline alcohol use, and rural versus urban
 site, there were no significant differences in proportion of participants with more than 90%
 adherence by MEMS cap opening in the isoniazid incentive versus no incentive groups.
 Median MEMS cap openings out of days prescribed isoniazid was 96·7% (IQR 89·4–99·4)
 
<section> Author in the isoniazid incentive groups and 96·7% (89·4–99·4) in the no isoniazid incentive groups.
 In a negative binomial regression model evaluating adherence as a continuous measure, there
 was no significant association between the isoniazid intervention and isoniazid adherence
 
<section> Manuscript (p=0·15), after adjusting for sex, site, and randomisation to incentives for reduced alcohol
 use.
 
<section> Isoniazid discontinuation due to a grade 3 or higher adverse event occurred in 53 (8%)

 and hepatotoxicity resulting in isoniazid discontinuation, after adjusting for sex and site
 (table 3). There was significant heterogeneity in hepatotoxicity by site: one rural site had
 significantly greater hepatotoxicity rates than the urban site used as a reference (appendix

<section> Discussion
 
<section> Manuscript In this factorial randomised trial, escalating financial incentives contingent on recent alcohol
 abstinence led to significantly lower biomarker-confirmed alcohol use compared with no
 incentives over 6 months among adults with HIV–latent tuberculosis co-infection and
 hazardous alcohol use in Uganda. In contrast, escalating incentives contingent on adherence
 to isoniazid did not lead to significant increases in isoniazid use. The alcohol reduction 
<section> intervention was efficacious despite less intensive frequency of incentives and clinic visits
 
<section> Author than traditional contingency management programmes for substance use, suggesting that
 pragmatic modifications of contingency management for resource-limited settings can have
 efficacy. Despite an intervention effect, a large proportion of participants continued to
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> drink at hazardous levels. The lack of isoniazid adherence intervention effect adds to a
 mixed literature on the effectiveness of incentives in promoting daily medication adherence,
 suggesting other interventions are needed to support adherence to tuberculosis preventive
 therapy among people with HIV at high tuberculosis risk (with >25% of participants not
 achieving >90% daily IPT adherence), including those with hazardous alcohol use.
 
<section> To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate efficacy of incentives for reducing
 alcohol use in sub-Saharan Africa. To date, strategies to reduce hazardous alcohol use
 in sub-Saharan Africa have relied on counselling-based interventions ranging from brief
 
<section> Author (one session) to lengthy (12 sessions) counselling, with mixed success. 
<section> 22 Some studies
 among people with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa have shown efficacy for counselling-based
 interventions; 
<section> 23,24 others have not. 
<section> 25–27 However, alcohol use is frequently under-reported,
 
<section> Manuscript which can lead to spurious results; only a few of these previous studies included an objective
 alcohol use measure, such as PEth, as part of their main alcohol outcomes, 
<section> 25,27 which
 might explain, in part, the mixed findings. Our study is one of the first to show a biomarker-
 confirmed effect of an intervention on alcohol use among people with HIV in sub-Saharan
 Africa.
 
<section> For our primary alcohol use outcome, we used a stringent definition of non-hazardous
 use, defined by self-report and PEth below 35 ng/mL at both 3-month and 6-month visits:
 only 18% of participants in the intervention group and 10% in the control group met this
 definition. We chose this outcome with the goal of promoting very low levels of alcohol
 
<section> Author
 
<section> use to reduce risk of hepatotoxicity during IPT. Baseline severity of alcohol use was
 high, with a mean PEth level of 252 ng/mL, above the suggested cutoff of 200 ng/mL
 (akin to approximately four drinks per day) for chronic high-risk use. 
<section> 21 Therefore, our
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> secondary analysis that showed greater declines in PEth levels in intervention versus control
 (p=0·084) suggests intervention efficacy in reducing alcohol use, even without abstinence.
 Our subgroup analyses found that people with HIV with lower baseline alcohol use (PEth
 <200 ng/mL and AUDIT-C <6) experienced a greater intervention effect compared with
 those with higher baseline alcohol use. More work is needed to confirm these findings
 and their impacts on other health and psychosocial outcomes, including implementation
 considerations and combining economic incentives with effective elements of counselling
 interventions. Moreover, pharmacotherapy should be considered as a potential adjuvant, or
 stepped intervention, in future studies. Additionally, several previous studies of incentive
 
<section> Author interventions have found that incentivised behaviours might decrease after incentives
 are withdrawn. 9 Long-term, post-intervention effects of our alcohol intervention merit
 evaluation and are ongoing for this study at time of publication.
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> The isoniazid adherence intervention did not result in increased isoniazid pill bottle opening,
 with overall high adherence. One explanation for this finding is that we enrolled people
 with HIV engaged in care and with high baseline viral suppression. As such, we might
 have selected for participants who were largely adherent to medications despite alcohol use, 
<section> limiting our ability to detect an intervention effect. We also included reactive TST as an
 
<section> Author inclusion criterion to identify people with HIV at very high risk of active tuberculosis.
 Global guidelines recommend tuberculosis preventive therapy for people with HIV in
 high tuberculosis prevalence settings without TST, due to benefits of IPT in TST-negative
 
<section> Manuscript individuals and the logistical challenges of TST interpretation. 8 Anecdotally, study staff
 noted that some participants reported motivation to take IPT after seeing their reactive TSTs
 at baseline, considering it evidence of tuberculosis infection in need of preventive therapy.
 Our findings add to the literature of interventions to promote adherence to tuberculosis
 preventive therapy. In a systematic review of such interventions, incentives had mixed
 results in increasing tuberculosis preventive therapy adherence, whereas use of short-course
 preventive therapy had positive effects. 6 Increasing availability of short-course therapy for
 people with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, including weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for
 12 weeks or daily isoniazid and rifapentine for 4 weeks, might improve adherence to
 
<section> Author tuberculosis preventive therapy among people with HIV with hazardous alcohol use. Our
 results suggest incentives for isoniazid use are unlikely to impact IPT adherence in this
 population.
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> We did not find significant differences in grade 3 or higher hepatotoxicity by study group,
 although point estimates of hepatotoxicity were lower in the alcohol intervention group and
 closer to expected hepatotoxicity rates among non-drinkers (around 3–5%). 
<section> 28 We excluded
 individuals with abnormal transaminase levels (more than two times the upper limit of
 normal) and conducted monthly liver function testing during IPT, limiting generalisability of
 our findings to people with abnormal baseline transaminase levels or settings where no liver
 function testing is available. Our observed hepatotoxicity levels are consistent with other
 recent studies from sub-Saharan Africa, 
<section> 29,30 suggesting isoniazid might not increase the risk
 for serious toxicity under these circumstances.
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Our study has limitations. First, bottle opening might not reflect pill ingestion. Long-term
 biomarkers of adherence, such as hair isoniazid measures, could provide a more accurate
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> adherence measure, and analyses of hair measures in this trial are underway. Second,
 we did not conduct cost-effectiveness analyses. Our goal was to evaluate efficacy of the
 interventions. Based on our findings, cost-effectiveness modelling of the alcohol reduction
 intervention is merited. Third, our results might not be generalisable to people with
 HIV with hazardous alcohol use offered short-course tuberculosis preventive therapy or
 isoniazid for active tuberculosis treatment. However, there are substantial health benefits
 to reduced alcohol use, and incentives to reduce alcohol use merit further evaluation for
 other health outcomes where periods of low (or no) alcohol use are needed, such as
 active tuberculosis treatment or pregnancy. Fourth, intervention masking was not possible.
 
<section> Author This could have discouraged control (group 1) participants from decreasing alcohol use
 or increasing isoniazid adherence. We think this was unlikely, given the high retention
 across groups. Furthermore, the relatively high attention provided to group 1, with surveys,
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> liver function testing, MEMS cap measures, and counselling, compared with standard care,
 would probably bias the results towards a null effect (ie, greater reduction in alcohol use
 in our control group than in an unobserved control receiving standard care), suggesting
 that we might have observed a conservative estimate of our alcohol intervention. Lastly,
 Uganda’s national COVID-19 lockdown resulted in an 8-week period during which study 
<section> activities were paused for a subset of participants. However, the lockdown did not result in
 
<section> Author participants missing study procedures, apart from delayed refills of isoniazid. Our study also
 has strengths, including a randomised controlled trial design, high trial retention, objective
 measures of alcohol use and isoniazid pill bottle opening, and measures of fidelity to
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> intervention implementation.
 
<section> In conclusion, escalating financial incentives contingent on reduced alcohol use led to
 significantly lower biomarker-confirmed alcohol use, whereas incentives based on recent
 isoniazid adherence did not lead to changes in isoniazid adherence, among people with HIV
 with latent tuberculosis infection and hazardous alcohol use receiving IPT. Given the high
 prevalence of heavy alcohol use among people with HIV in this setting, the positive effect of
 our intervention is promising and merits further study and implementation.

<section> Evidence before this study
 
<section> Manuscript Alcohol use, a major contributor to morbidity and mortality globally, is common among
 people living with HIV and is a risk factor for tuberculosis. Sub-Saharan Africa has the
 highest burden of disease and injury attributable to alcohol use, as well as the highest
 prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis co-infection, worldwide. Hazardous alcohol use
 contributes to worse HIV and tuberculosis outcomes due to non-adherence to isoniazid
 preventive therapy (IPT) and antiretroviral therapy (both of which significantly reduce
 the risk of tuberculosis disease among people with HIV) and hepatotoxicity during
 IPT. Interventions are urgently needed to reduce hazardous alcohol use and improve
 IPT adherence among people with HIV. We searched PubMed on June 14, 2023,
 for literature on interventions to reduce hazardous alcohol use in sub-Saharan Africa,
 
<section> Author
 
<section> using the search terms (alcohol AND intervention AND Africa AND HIV), as well
 as (alcohol AND [contingency management OR incentive] AND Africa AND HIV),
 without language or date restrictions. We also searched PubMed on June 14, 2023, for
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> literature on interventions to increase adherence to tuberculosis preventive therapy, using
 the search terms ([tuberculosis preventive therapy OR isoniazid preventive therapy] AND
 adherence AND intervention), without language or date restrictions. To date, strategies
 to reduce hazardous alcohol use in sub-Saharan Africa have relied on counselling-based
 interventions with mixed success. In addition, alcohol use is frequently under-reported
 which can lead to spurious results: only a few of these previous alcohol intervention
 studies included an objective alcohol use measure as part of their main alcohol outcomes,
 which possibly explains the mixed findings. To our knowledge, incentive-based strategies
 to treat alcohol use have not previously been evaluated in sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly,
 
<section> Author data supporting incentives to promote tuberculosis preventive therapy adherence are
 limited, despite evidence that adherence to IPT is a challenge. In a 2016 systematic
 review, mixed results were found for the use of incentives to promote tuberculosis
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> preventive therapy. Like alcohol use, tuberculosis preventive therapy studies are subject
 to reporting biases, including overestimation of adherence when relying on self-report.
 Whether incentive-based interventions can improve IPT adherence remains unknown.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 
<section> In this 2 × 2 factorial randomised trial that enrolled adults with HIV–tuberculosis
 co-infection and hazardous alcohol use initiating a 6-month course of IPT in Uganda,
 escalating financial incentives contingent on recent alcohol abstinence led to significantly
 lower biomarker-confirmed alcohol use compared with no incentives. In contrast,
 
<section> Author escalating incentives contingent on adherence to isoniazid did not lead to significant
 increases in isoniazid use, as measured by electronic pill bottle opening monitoring.
 The alcohol reduction intervention was efficacious despite less intensive frequency of
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> incentives and clinic visits than traditional contingency management programmes for
 substance use, suggesting that pragmatic modifications of contingency management for
 resource-limited settings can have efficacy. Our study is one of the first studies to show a
 biomarker-confirmed effect of an intervention on alcohol use among people with HIV in
 sub-Saharan Africa. 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 
<section> Author
 
<section> To date, published interventions to reduce hazardous alcohol use in sub-Saharan Africa
 have focused on counselling-based interventions, with mixed results, due in part to
 
<section> Manuscript limited use of objective alcohol use measures. Our study demonstrates that escalating
 financial incentives contingent on recent alcohol abstinence (a pragmatic modification
 to traditional, more intensive, contingency management interventions) are efficacious in
 lowering biomarker-confirmed alcohol use, adding a novel alcohol reduction intervention
 for use in resource-limited settings to the literature. Despite an intervention effect,
 a large proportion of participants continued to drink at hazardous levels, and more
 work is needed, including evaluation of combination intervention approaches, to reduce
 hazardous alcohol use. In addition, our study adds to mixed evidence in the literature on
 the efficacy of incentive interventions to promote adherence to tuberculosis preventive
 therapy. Our results suggest that incentives are not efficacious in increasing adherence to
 
<section> Author
 
<section> IPT, and other interventions are needed to support adherence to tuberculosis preventive
 therapy among people with HIV at high risk of tuberculosis, including those with
 
<section> Manuscript 
<section> hazardous alcohol use.
