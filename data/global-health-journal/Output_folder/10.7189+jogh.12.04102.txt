 controlled trial
 
<section> Background In Sub-Saharan Africa, 41 to 58% of the caregivers of children with
 disabilities experience psychological distress and have poor mental well-being.
 Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has a moderate effect on improving mental
 well-being. However, no study has examined its effects among caregivers of chil-
 dren with disabilities at home and in schools. This study evaluated the effectiveness
 of CBT in improving mental well-being among caregivers of children with disabil-
 ities in urban Uganda.
 
<section> Methods We conducted a two-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial in 11 schools
 across the Kampala district of Uganda. The intervention was a multi-modal CBT
 training program conducted for six months among 392 home and school caregivers
 of children with disabilities. In the first three months, caregivers received group-
 based CBT, and in the next three months, they received phone-based CBT. We used
 generalized linear mixed-effects regression to examine the differences in the men-
 tal well-being of caregivers in the control group vs those in the intervention group.
 
<section> Results Home caregivers’ mental well-being was significantly higher after phone-
 based CBT (unstandardized coefficient of the estimate (B) = 4.31, 95% CI = 1.18-
 
<section> 6.82; P < 0.001, Cohen’s D (d) = 0.27). School caregivers’ mental well-being was sig-
 nificantly higher after group-based CBT (B = 3.98, 95% CI = 0.22-7.47; P = 0.038,
 d = 0.25).
 
<section> Conclusions Group-based CBT improved mental well-being among school care-
 givers, and phone-based CBT improved mental well-being among home caregivers.
 Interventions targeting school caregivers of children with disabilities should employ
 group settings and those targeting home caregivers should utilize peer-to-peer net-
 works to enhance the caregivers’ mental well-being.
 
<section> Registration The study protocol was registered with UMIN Clinical Trials Registry
 (UMIN-CTR). Trial ID: UMIN000040912.
 The mental well-being of caregivers of children with disabilities is a global health con-
 cern. Globally, over 38% of caregivers of children with disabilities have clinical depres-
 sion [1,2], and 41 to 58% in Sub-Saharan Africa face psychological distress [3]. In low-
 and middle-income countries (LMICs), the caregivers face up to 15% increased financial
 burden because of their children’s disabilities [4]. The burden of poor mental well-be-
 ing among caregivers of children with disabilities is amplified in LMICs because of 1)
 a lack of financial resources, 2) scarcity of trained mental health professionals, and 3) a
 negative outlook on disability [5,6]. These precarious dynamics cause heightened stress
 and anxiety for home and school caregivers, resulting in poor mental well-being [5,7]. 
<section> In Sub-Saharan Africa, only about 10% of the population can access mental health care or evidence-based
 treatments [3]. The lack of access is partly due to insufficient numbers of trained mental health care profes-
 sionals. For instance, one occupational therapist is available for every 100 families of children with disabili-
 ties in Uganda [8]. Moreover, approximately 88% of the families cannot meet their daily necessities, let alone
 afford professional health care for their children [8,9]. In addition, many communities in Sub-Saharan Africa
 still harbour negative attitudes towards disability and consider having a child with a disability a curse [10,11].
 In response to these challenges, home caregivers in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda, sometimes send
 their children to schools because they believe schools are a safe abode for them.
 
<section> At school, children with disabilities receive care primarily from school caregivers [12,13]. School caregivers
 are those designated to support children with disabilities at school or teachers of the children [13]. In Uganda,
 school caregivers often feel ill-equipped to provide adequate care for children with disabilities because most do
 not receive formal training in special needs education [11,12]. They sometimes face difficulties bonding with
 children with disabilities due to sudden changes in the children’s behaviour [14,15], face unrealistic expec-
 tations, and feel unappreciated by home caregivers [16,17]. Upon the recommendation of the World Health
 Organization, the government of Uganda adopted community-based rehabilitation (CBR) to overcome these
 challenges [18]. However, because of financial and infrastructural constraints, few (35% of 2 million) families
 of children with disabilities in Uganda can access CBR services at local health centres [19,20]. A lack of access
 to CBR services perpetuates the challenge of poor mental well-being among caregivers. Interventions, such as
 cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), could democratize access to mental health care and improve caregivers’
 mental well-being and their ability to care for children with disabilities [21-23].
 
<section> CBT is a treatment package that aims to reduce individuals’ negative beliefs about themselves or their capabil-
 ities [24,25]. A meta-analysis of 16 systematic reviews spanning 322 clinical trials found that CBT interven-
 tions were moderately superior to anti-depressants for treating depression in adults [26]. Moreover, one study
 reported that CBT interventions effectively reduced 16 psychological disorders, including generalized anxiety
 and psychological distress [26]. However, there remains much uncertainty about how the benefits of CBT may
 vary among different groups, such as home and school caregivers of children with disabilities.
 Understanding the effectiveness of different CBT modalities is crucial for researchers and policymakers to plan
 effective interventions for caregivers of children with disabilities. Previous studies offer no insight into the ef-
 fectiveness of different modalities of CBT among groups of people who face similar challenges [24-27]. No
 study has investigated the efficacy of CBT delivered by trained therapists vs peer mentors. There is also no ev-
 idence on the effects of non-treatment aspects of CBT, such as group settings vs phone-based settings, on the
 mental well-being of caregivers of children with disabilities [27]. We hypothesized that group-based CBT, led
 by trained therapists, and phone-based CBT, led by peer mentors, would have distinct benefits for home and
 school caregivers. Thus, this study examined the effectiveness of a multi-modal CBT intervention for improv-
 ing the mental well-being of caregivers of children with disabilities in Kampala district, Uganda.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Study design and setting
 
<section> The study was a cluster-randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of multi-modal CBT in im-
 proving the mental well-being of caregivers of children with disabilities. We followed a two-group, parallel-arm
 design with equal allocation and variable cluster sizes [28,29]. The clusters were schools of children with dis-
 abilities registered by the Kampala Capital City Authority. At the time of the study, Kampala district had
 schools for children with disabilities, with a potential population of 1000 home caregivers and 350 school
 caregivers. Of the 14 schools, two were recruited for a pilot study and the remaining 12 for the main study. Of
 the 12 schools, six were allocated to the intervention group and six to the control group.
 Home and school caregivers in the intervention group joined a six-month multi-modal CBT program. In the
 first three months (April-June 2021), the caregivers received group-based CBT led by trained therapists. In
 the next three months (July-September 2021), the caregivers received phone-based CBT led by peer mentors.
 Caregivers in the control group received treatment as usual.

<section> tial attrition. Home and school caregivers in the participating schools were invited to an information seminar
 by researchers and school administrators. Caregivers who did not wish to be contacted were requested to in-
 form the school’s administration to remove their contacts from the lists before they were available to research-
 ers. After obtaining the contact lists, all caregivers were invited to an information seminar to join the study.
 
<section> Randomization and masking
 
<section> Schools were stratified based on their type (inclusive or special needs) and potential population size. A com-
 puterized program, “Randomization in Treatment Arms,” with a 1:1 allocation ratio was used to assign schools
 to either the control group (n = 6) or the intervention group (n = 6). Allocation was concealed from schools,
 trainers, research assistants, and participants until recruitment was completed. Study participants and train-
 ers were not blinded due to the educational nature of the intervention [31]. Caregivers gave their consent
 to participate in the study before randomization, and they received an intervention based on the allocation
 of the school.
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> The intervention was a multi-modal CBT program conducted over six months [32]. The CBT modules were
 selected from the manual “a therapist’s guide to CBT” [33]. Trained therapists and peer mentors delivered the
 modules separately in two distinct phases. The structure of the CBT program is shown in 
<section> Table 2.
 
<section> Phase one: Group-based cognitive behavioural therapy
 
<section> Caregivers were divided into groups of 15-20 and received the intervention in their assigned cohorts. One oc-
 cupational therapist and a clinical psychiatric officer delivered the CBT modules following a standard training
 manual. Home and school caregivers received bi-monthly sessions for an hour. The caregivers used exercise
 books and pencils for taking notes or drawing pictures to depict emotions that were difficult to express ver-
 bally. They also used the exercise books to complete homework assignments at the end of each group session.
 The caregivers used both English and Luganda during the group activities. Each group-based CBT session
 lasted 60-80 minutes.
 
<section> Phase two: Phone-based cognitive behavioural therapy
 
<section> Peer mentors delivered phone-based CBT by making phone calls at the beginning of each month and send-
 ing follow-up messages at the end of the month. The peer mentors used a logbook detailing topics for phone
 discussions and structured text messages. Peer mentors then made monthly reports that were used for guided
 group discussions with their mentees.
 
<section> Intervention development
 
<section> The modules for group-based and phone-based CBT were examined for cultural relevance and acceptability
 in a pilot study. Four experts, two from Kyambogo University and two from local non-governmental organi-

 zations (Cheshire services and L’Arche Uganda), monitored and evaluated the pilot study and recommended
 substituting activities such as breathing and meditation with singing, dancing, and using local dramas to stim-
 ulate discussions among caregivers.
 
<section> Conditions for the control group
 
<section> Caregivers in the control group received treatment as usual from schools. Typically, schools for children with
 disabilities in the Kampala district, Uganda, provide directive and non-directive counselling through guidance,
 emotional support, and sign language classes for home and school caregivers. Counselling is provided only by
 school nurses who do not use specific psychotherapeutic treatments but can write hospital referrals for caregiv-
 ers who need mental health care services. At the time of the study, the nurses conducted counselling services
 on the phone. Phone calls between nurses and caregivers lasted an average of 20 minutes.
 
<section> Outcome measures
 
<section> The primary outcome was mental well-being, measured by the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale
 (WEMWBS) [34]. We assessed mental well-being scores at the individual level rather than the cluster level.
 We examined differences in caregivers’ mental well-being at three intervals: baseline, three months follow-up
 (immediately after phase one; group-based CBT), and six months follow-up (immediately after phase two;
 phone-based CBT).
 
<section> Two language experts from Makerere University, Uganda, translated the WEMWBS from English to Luganda
 (the most spoken language in urban Uganda). A third translator from Naruto university, Japan, back-translated
 it for confirmation. The forward and back translation processes underwent five iterations through discussions
 among the three language experts and researchers. The final draft of the translated questionnaire was pre-test-
 ed in a pilot study with 20 caregivers from two schools. The Luganda WEMWBS contained 14 items rated on
 a 4-point Likert scale. Caregivers used a questionnaire either in Luganda or English.
 
<section> Socio-demographic characteristics
 
<section> Caregivers’ socio-demographic characteristics were assessed at baseline. The data were categorized into con-
 tinuous variables (age and years of education) and categorical variables (sex, religious affiliation, employment,
 forms of social support, and family type). Cognitive behavioural therapy and mental well-being
 
<section> Data collection
 
<section> Data were collected using a self-reported questionnaire. Three trained research assistants facilitated data col-
 lection by reading aloud questions for caregivers who could not read or preferred to have the questions read
 to them. The research assistants demonstrated how to select responses by circling or ticking. Caregivers used
 40-60 minutes to complete the survey.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted separately for school caregivers and home caregivers. Data from
 clusters in the intervention group and 5 clusters from the control group were used in the analysis.
 
<section> Preliminary analyses
 
<section> First, we used histograms to gain a high-level view of the distribution of the outcome variable: mental well-be-
 ing. Then we performed a Shapiro-Wilk test to examine the normality of the residues of the outcome variable
 [35,36]. We considered data to be normally distributed if the P-value was above 0.05 or skewed if the P-val-
 ue was below 0.05. We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with continuity correction to check for differences
 in median outcomes of caregivers in the intervention group and control group at baseline, three months, and
 six months.
 
<section> Mixed-effects regression analysis
 
<section> Variables that were significantly associated with the outcome (based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum tests) were en-
 tered into generalized linear mixed-effects regression models to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on
 caregivers’ mental well-being. All analyses were conducted using RStudio (Packages: Tidyverse, lme4, Lavaan,
 sensemakr, and simr) at 5% significance level [37]. We considered the results statistically significant when the
 
<section> P value was lower than 0.05.
 
<section> Ethical considerations
 
<section> The study conformed with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki for clinical trials. Participa-
 tion was voluntary, and caregivers could withdraw from the study at any time. All caregivers who participated
 in the study provided written informed consent. Those who could not write used a fingerprint on the consent
 forms. All data were collected in private classrooms. Research assistants and field coordinators were recruited
 from Kyambogo University Uganda from the special needs education faculty to promote diversity and inclu-
 sion. Moreover, the peer mentors who led phone-based CBT were selected from the study’s participants. The
 study findings have been shared with all participating schools and the Kampala Capital City Authority.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Flow of participants through the study
 
<section> Of 852 caregivers that were invited, 573 (67.2%) accepted to join the study. Of them, 447 were home caregiv-
 ers, and 126 were school caregivers. After allocation, one school in the control group (55 caregivers) dropped
 out, citing administrative reasons. Thus, the study included 11 schools and analysed data from 392 caregiv-
 ers. Before the intervention, the intra-cluster correlation was 0.067. The baseline characteristics of the clusters
 (schools) are presented in Table S1 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document.
 
<section> Baseline characteristics of the participants
 
<section> Out of 392 caregivers, 50.7% of the home caregivers and 48.3% of the school caregivers attended all six group-
 based CBT sessions. Of all, 80% of the caregivers received phone-based CBT. At three months follow-up, 84.7%
 responded to the survey, while 83.9% responded at six months follow-up. There were no statistically signif-
 icant differences among caregivers lost to follow-up in the intervention group vs those in the control group.
 The flow of participants through the study is shown in 
<section> Figure 1.
 
<section> Table 3 shows the baseline characteristics of the caregivers. Home caregivers in the intervention and control
 groups were similar across education levels and religious affiliations. More than 50.0% had vocational educa-
 tion, and approximately one-third (34.0%) were protestant by religion. Home caregivers in the intervention
 group had a mean age of 42.3 (standard deviation (SD) = 11.4) years, and those in the control group had a
 mean age of 40.8 (SD = 11.4) years. About one-third (27.9%) of the caregivers in the intervention group were
 unemployed.

<iend>

 School caregivers in the intervention and control groups were also similar in their levels of education and re-
 ligious affiliations. The lowest level of education among them was incomplete secondary school (9.9%), and
 50.0% of them had completed university. Of all, 46.2% were protestant by religion. School caregivers in the
 intervention group had a mean age of 36.6 (SD = 10.1) years, and those in the control group had a mean age
 of 38.5 (SD = 9.9) years.
 
<section> Caregivers in the intervention and control groups had children similar in gender and severity of the disability.
 Approximately 60.0% of them had female children, and 43% considered their children’s disabilities moder-
 ate. Caregivers in the intervention group had children with a mean age of 11.5 (SD = 3.8) years. Also, 16.8%
 of the caregivers in the intervention group had children with intellectual disabilities compared to 9.4% in the
 control group.

 in the intervention group had higher mental well-being scores than those in the control group, although it was

 home caregivers in the intervention group had higher mental well-being than those in the control group, based
 on models 1 and 2.

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> The study examined the effectiveness of multi-modal CBT in improving the mental well-being of caregivers of
 children with disabilities in urban Uganda. School caregivers’ mental well-being was higher after group-based
 CBT and home caregivers’ mental well-being was higher after phone-based CBT. Thus, the study confirms the
 hypothesis that CBT has distinct benefits for home and school caregivers of children with disabilities, based
 on its mode of delivery.
 
<section> Group-based CBT effectively improved school caregivers’ mental well-being. However, there was no signif-
 icant change in the caregivers’ mental well-being after phone-based CBT. Like this study, a previous study
 reported that group-based CBT was effective for managing work-related stress among adults with depres-
 sion [38]. The school caregivers in the current study may have been more receptive to group-based CBT
 than phone-based CBT because they faced similar challenges and could quickly build a shared identity and
 social cohesiveness [39]. In group-based CBT, social cohesiveness acts as a springboard that launches par-
 ticipants toward improved mental well-being [27]. Therefore, the individualized nature of phone-based
 CBT was not a good crucible for managing the work-related stress that school caregivers of children with
 disabilities commonly face.
 
<section> Home caregivers’ mental well-being was higher after phone-based CBT but not group-based CBT. This finding
 contrasts with a previous study among caregivers of people with dementia and depression, where the effects
 of group-based CBT gradually improved but not for phone-based CBT [40]. The contrast is likely because in
 this study, phone-based CBT was led by peer mentors who were also caregivers of children with disabilities.
 Given that caregivers of children with disabilities face varied challenges, the peer mentors in this study were
 well-equipped to provide targeted psychosocial support, improving their mentees’ well-being [41]. It follows
 that group-based CBT may not have been sensitive to the vast challenges associated with caring for children
 with varied disabilities, as was the case for home caregivers in this study [27]. The influence of variation in
 home caregivers’ challenges was reflected in the differences in their mental well-being, based on the type of
 disability of their children.
 
<section> Unlike previous studies, this study combined four CBT techniques of cognitive reframing, problem-solv-
 ing, relaxation, and behavioural activation. Earlier studies focused on either one or a combination of the four
 techniques [42,43]. This study shows that incorporating all four CBT techniques in an intervention improves
 mental well-being of caregivers of children with disabilities at home and school. Thus, the study highlights
 the possibility of expanding CBT’s current application beyond single techniques and delivery by trained thera-
 pists. Moreover, the study’s approach increases the potential to reach more people needing mental health care
 services, including caregivers of children with disabilities.
 
<section> Strengths and limitations
 
<section> The study’s findings have been interpreted considering the following biases. First, the study could not achieve
 the targeted sample size of 960 participants. The low recruitment rate was caused by the prolonged closure
 of schools and a total ban on internal travel in Uganda during the study period. Second, the study employed
 self-reported measures. Respondents may have exaggerated or underreported their responses, affecting the
 validity of estimates [44] However, the translated WEMWBS used in the study showed good internal validity.
 Therefore, this study has availed tools that other researchers can use in Uganda. Third, the study was conduct-
 ed for a short time. Given that the intervention and time interaction was positive and statistically significant
 for home caregivers’ mental well-being, it is possible that the actual effect of the intervention is greater than
 what was observed in this study [45] Future studies could conduct the intervention for a longer time span to
 determine its effects over time. Fourth, the study included only caregivers of children in schools. These care-
 givers may be different from those whose children are not enrolled in school and therefore experience differ-
 ent effects of the intervention. Future studies can now explore the effects of multi-modal CBT among caregiv-
 ers of children with disabilities in school and in the community. Lastly, the absence of blinding of participants
 and therapists may have caused contamination between caregivers in the intervention group and those in the
 control group [32]. Such contamination lowers a study’s ability to conclude on the effectiveness of a trial [46].
 However, contamination reflects the reality of caregivers and indicates that the intervention is relevant and ac-
 ceptable for them.
