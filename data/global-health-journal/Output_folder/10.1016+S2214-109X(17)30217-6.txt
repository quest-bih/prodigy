<section> Research in context
 
<section> Evidence before this study
 Before this study, systematic reviews had shown that
 interventions designed to improve water quality, sanitation,
 and hygiene (WASH) practices were generally effective at
 preventing reported diarrhoea among young children in
 low-income settings. There was less evidence that WASH
 interventions could improve children’s nutritional status. In
 general, reviews found the underlying evidence to be of low
 quality. Moreover, randomised controlled trials of WASH
 interventions delivered programmatically showed no
 protective effect against diarrhoea, possibly because of poor
 delivery and uptake of the intervention. Community health
 clubs had been promoted in many countries in Africa and
 southeast Asia as a means of improving WASH practices and
 nutrition. However, they had never been evaluated rigorously
 for their effect on health or other outcomes.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 The results of our cluster-randomised controlled trial show no
 effect of a community health club intervention on
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial to assess the
 CBEHPP and community health club approach in a district
 of Rwanda. To choose a location for the study, we worked
 with the Rwandan Ministry of Health and the programme
 implementer to select a district based on two criteria. First,
 the district had to have no previous implementation of
 CBEHPP and no existing donor commitment to support
 implementation. Four of 30 districts nationwide met this
 first criterion. Second, we sought a district with a high
 burden of the diseases targeted by the planned intervention.
 Using existing administrative data and focusing on diseases
 such as malaria and helminth infection, the implementation
 and research team examined the composition and severity
 of the disease burden. The disease burden and absence of
 donors across these four districts are strong predictors for a
 high poverty concentration. We selected Rusizi district of
 western Rwanda for this trial.
 In Rwanda, districts are divided into sectors, followed
 by cells, then villages. Cells contain two to eight villages.
 Villages, as defined by the National Institute of Statistics
 Rwanda (NISR), are the smallest geographical unit to
 describe the allocation of the population. Village size is
 heterogeneous: data from the national census of 2012
 indicate that the mean village population is 600 (SD 300).
 For our trial, we defined a cluster as a village. The
 intervention entailed formation of community health
 clubs at the village level.
 The protocol for this study was reviewed and approved
 by the Rwandan National Ethics Committee and the
 Institutional Review Board of Innovations for Poverty
 Action. We obtained written informed consent from the
 main respondent before interview.
 
<section> caregiver-reported diarrhoea among children younger than
 5 years or on nutritional status among infants younger than
 2 years. We noted positive effects of community health clubs on
 some household-level intermediate outcomes within villages
 allocated the full-length intervention (ie, 20 community health
 club sessions), but these did not translate into improvements in
 individual-level health and nutrition outcomes. Approaches
 that use group education sessions for behaviour change with
 the aim of improving maternal and child health and nutrition
 are common in low-income and middle-income countries. Our
 study suggests that these approaches might not be effective in
 producing measurable improvements in health and nutrition.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 There is a need for more rigorous investigations to identify
 low-cost interventions that are effective at improving child
 health and nutrition, either independently or in combination.
 These studies will need to assess programme delivery and
 adherence to understand whether provision of interventions
 can be improved to achieve greater effects.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 Of 598 villages in Rusizi district, we randomly selected
 150 to take part in our trial (figure). We did the random
 selection of villages in collaboration with NISR, which
 shared a recently updated sampling frame of sectors, cells,
 and villages for Rusizi district but did not share any
 geographical identifiers. To minimise contamination, we
 randomly selected five complete study samples of
 150 villages each, then requested that NISR map the five
 samples. Based on the resulting maps, we chose the one
 sample that minimised the number of villages with shared
 borders. For each of the five samples, the study team had
 used a simple random sampling routine in Stata to select
 at most two villages from large cells (≥3 villages) and one
 village from small cells (<3 villages). We then randomly
 sorted the cells and selected the villages numbered
 from 1 to 150 to comprise the study sample.
 We did a baseline survey of the 150 villages, which
 included water sampling. 8 To increase the study’s power
 to accurately detect improvements in child health, we
 stratified the 150 villages along two dimensions: average
 fraction of children younger than 2 years with caregiver-
 reported diarrhoea in the previous 7 days; and average
 wealth index, which is a standardised variable (mean 0·04
 [SD 0·67]). The wealth index is a weighted average of a
 household’s ownership of 17 assets in three categories:
 durable goods such as refrigerator, television, and bicycle;
 large livestock such as cattle, goats, or sheep; and
 attributes of the housing structure, such as the roofing,
 wall, and floor materials. Data for both diarrhoea and
 wealth came from the baseline survey. Along both of
 these dimensions, we divided the sample into three
 equally sized groups representing high, moderate,
 and low levels of diarrhoea and wealth. We then

<section> Procedures
 Full details of the intervention background and activities
 are described elsewhere. 8 Briefly, community health
 clubs in villages allocated to the Lite intervention held
 eight sessions on village mapping, personal hygiene,
 handwashing, diarrhoea, water sources, safe storage of
 drinking water, treatment of drinking water, and
 sanitation. The Classic intervention included 20 sessions,
 consisting of all the Lite sessions plus common diseases,
 skin diseases, infant care (weaning and immunisation),
 worms and intestinal parasites, food hygiene, nutrition,
 food safety and food security, the model home, good
 parenting, respiratory disease, malaria, bilharzia
 (schistosomiasis), and HIV/AIDS. In each village, the
 facilitator determined the meeting times and frequency.
 All sessions were open to any community members,
 with no inclusion or exclusion criteria. Most sessions
 had associated homework assignments to reinforce
 participants’ learning. Implementation of the community
 health club model was consistent with the approach
 described elsewhere.
 For both interventions, community health club
 sessions were typically led by the In-Charge of Social
 Affairs (referred to in this report as the facilitator), who is
 one of five members of the village-level Executive

 Implementation of community health clubs was
 complete in all intervention villages by March, 2015.
 In the baseline survey, we targeted for inclusion all
 households with a child younger than 5 years in the study
 area, with no exclusion criteria. Data collection methods
 for the baseline survey have been described elsewhere.
 Methods for the endline survey followed those of the
 baseline, including a structured survey, observation, and
 collection of drinking water samples from roughly 10% of
 households. All follow-up, including water sampling,
 took place during one visit. For the endline survey, data
 collectors attempted to visit all households that had
 enrolled in the baseline survey. If the data collector visited
 a household three times in 1 day, with an interval of at
 least 2 h between each visit, and was not able to enrol the
 household, we recorded the household as a temporary
 absence. In the endline survey, we gathered data for
 caregiver-reported diarrhoea prevalence and anthro­ po­
 
<section> (68%) metric measurements for all children younger than
 5 years. The baseline survey included length measure­
 ments for children younger than 2 years and weight
 measurements for children younger than 5 years;
 therefore, some older children in the endline survey had
 data from both baseline and endline surveys.
 All data collectors were trained in pairs to obtain
 
<section> (90%) anthropometric measurements according to a standard
 procedure. The training included standardisation
 sessions at local health centres. 12,13 We retrained any pairs
 of data collectors whose interobserver reliability was
 outside a predetermined range, and the pair attended
 another standardisation session to confirm improvement.
 We weighed all children younger than 5 years once, to
 the nearest 20 g (for weight <20 kg) or 50 g (for weight
 between 20 kg and 50 kg) using a Seca 385 scale (Seca,
 
<section> was Hamburg, Germany). We measured length (for children

<section> toilet. boards and height (for children ≥24 months) to the
 nearest 0·1 cm with Seca 213 stadiometers. We measured
 length and height in duplicate; we calculated the average
 of the two measurements for the analysis. If the two
 the Classic measurements differed by more than 0·7 cm, we asked
 in data collectors to obtain a third length or height

 We obtained data for demographics (eg, child age and
 point after sex) and validated children’s birth dates through
 dates and immunisation cards when possible. We calculated
 villages, stunting (defined as height-for-age or length-for-age
 such as Z score <–2) and wasting (defined as weight-for-height

<section> the comparison of two proportions, and a design effect
 calculated on the basis of the intravillage correlation and
 village size, we estimated that 50 villages per arm would
 yield 80% power to detect the 25% reduction in diarrhoea.
 We calculated descriptive statistics for each study group
 at baseline. Analysis of primary, secondary, and
 intermediate outcomes was by intention to treat and per
 protocol (for the Classic intervention only) at household
 and individual levels. For dichotomous outcomes at the
 individual level, we used log-binomial regression with a
 log-link function and generalised estimating equations
 (GEE) to account for village-level clustering, then
 calculated the exponential of the coefficients to obtain
 prevalence ratios (PRs). For dichotomous outcomes at
 the household level, we used binomial regression with
 an identity link function and GEE to obtain risk
 differences (RDs). For the ordinal variable representing
 household food security, we used ordinal logistic
 regression then calculated the exponential of the
 coefficients to obtain odds ratios (ORs). For continuous
 variables, we used linear regression with GEE to account
 for village-level clustering.
 The primary analysis of anthropometric data included
 children measured both at baseline and endline. These
 children were all younger than 2 years at the time of the
 baseline survey and, hence, were aged 2–4 years at the
 time of the endline survey. Additional analyses included
 all children with anthropometric data, including but not
 restricted to those with baseline anthropometric data. For
 the main analysis of the effect of the interventions on
 height-for-age Z score and weight-for-height Z score
 among children who had been measured at baseline, we
 included that child’s baseline length-for-age Z score or
 weight-for-length Z score, respectively. The adjustment
 for baseline values was done to improve precision of the
 estimates. The anthropometric analysis including all
 children was further stratified for children younger than
 2 years and infants younger than 1 year, because the first
 two years of life are judged an important window for
 child growth. 20,21 No baseline adjustment was possible for
 these calculations.
 In all analyses, we estimated coefficients for villages
 assigned the Classic and Lite interventions as differences
 between these villages relative to those allocated the
 control. We did not adjust for imbalance between study
 groups at baseline, because the size of the differences
 was small.
 In the per-protocol analysis, we defined compliance
 as self-reported attendance of any household members
 at all 20 sessions. To investigate a potential dose-
 response relation between session attendance and
 effect size, we also calculated the effect size in those
 attending between one and 20 sessions. Because the
 per-protocol analysis showed no evidence for an effect,
 we did not further subdivide by the number of sessions.
 To reduce the risk of bias in the per-protocol analysis,
 we adjusted for baseline values of each outcome
 variable.
 All analyses were done using Stata version 14.1. This
 trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
 NCT01836731.

<section> Results
 
<section> Between May, 2013, and August, 2013, the baseline
 survey of households was done, and between
 Sept 21, 2015, and Dec 22, 2015, households were
 re-enrolled for the endline survey. Of 8734 households
 that consented to participate in the baseline survey,
 7934 (91%) households gave written consent to participate
 in the endline survey, with no difference in attrition
 between intervention groups (figure). The most common
 reasons for loss to follow-up were because the household
 moved away or because of a temporary absence, defined
 as being unavailable after data collectors visited the
 household three times in 1 day, with an interval of at least
 2 h between each visit. Of households that moved
 between the baseline and endline surveys, most moved
 outside the study area. Six households moved within the
 study area and were enrolled in the endline survey. Only
 one of these households moved to a village allocated a
 different intervention; this household was included in
 analyses based on its location at baseline. At baseline,
 anthropometric measurements were obtained for
 4598 children younger than 2 years; 3872 older children
 in the endline survey had anthropometric data from both
 baseline and endline surveys, whereas 5606 children had
 only post-intervention anthropometric data.

 Further analysis of the relation between adequate water

<section> The findings of our cluster-randomised trial indicate
 that community health clubs, as implemented under
 Rwanda’s national CBEHPP campaign in this setting in
 western Rwanda, had no effect on health outcomes
 (diarrhoea and anthropometric measures) or faecal
 contamination of household drinking water. Our results
 suggest positive effects on several intermediate
 outcomes, including reported household water
 treatment and type and structure of sanitation facilities.
 A somewhat higher proportion of households in villages
 assigned the Classic intervention reported treating their
 drinking water, and were seen to have improved and
 completed the structure of sanitation facilities, compared
 with households in villages assigned the control.
 However, these augmented intermediate outcomes did
 not lead to decreases in caregiver-reported prevalence of
 diarrhoea or improvements in children’s nutritional
 status.
 The increased prevalence of reported household
 water treatment did not translate into a difference in
 water quality, as measured by the number of
 thermotolerant coliforms per 100 mL water. The
 reasons for this discrepancy are not clear, but could be
 attributable to social desirability bias in self-reported
 treatment of drinking water. Respondents in
 intervention villages might have learned that they
 should be using adequate methods but were not actually
 using those methods. This theory is supported by data
 showing no association between self-reported
 household water treatment and water quality. The
 results suggest a need for studies to use quantitative 
<insert> widespread among children younger than 5 years. The
 absence of acute malnutrition in a context of relatively
 high food insecurity, as measured by the household
 hunger scale, is surprising. Our results suggest that
 families could be accessing and providing their children
 with adequate calories but inadequate dietary diversity.
 Since both disease and inadequate dietary intake are
 immediate causes of undernutrition, programmes that
 reduce diarrhoea prevalence and increase dietary diversity
 could also reduce stunting. 26 Finally, coverage of improved
 sanitation remains low, and handwashing stations remain
 almost non-existent among our study households.

<section> 11 Our
 were similar with respect to sanitation but
 with respect to other behaviours, such as 
<section> Articles
 
<section> handwashing, and we saw no effect on diarrhoea or
 anthropometric measures. Few other studies have
 examined the effectiveness of community-group-based
 models for health outcomes, with the exception of
 women’s groups for maternal and neonatal survival.
 Our results suggest that the community health club
 approach alone could be insufficient and that alternative
 or supplemental approaches might be needed to reduce
 the prevalence of diarrhoea in this population. For
 example, programmes could consider distributing
 water disinfection or filtration products to improve
 water quality. 28,29 Innovative approaches are needed to
 promote the presence of improved sanitation facilities
 and handwashing with soap, both of which are
 associated inversely with diarrhoea prevalence. 29–32
 Alternatively, an integrated agriculture and nutrition
 approach has shown success in reducing the prevalence
 of diarrhoea in young children in Burkina Faso; further
 research is needed on the effectiveness of this
 intervention in other settings. In general, future
 programmes should promote intervention adherence
 and should actively target households for which the
 need is greatest.
 A key limitation of this study is the reliance on self-
 reported data for several variables, including diarrhoea,
 treatment of drinking water, disposal of child faeces,
 infant and young child feeding practices, and attendance
 at community health club sessions. Limitations of the
 per-protocol analysis include that it is prone to bias and
 that compliance is not easily defined. The per-protocol
 analysis could be particularly at risk of bias because of the
 use of self-reported data for attendance. We were able to
 reduce the risk of bias in the per-protocol analysis by
 adjusting for baseline differences, but results nevertheless
 need to be treated with caution. Finally, we did not assess
 the quality of delivery of the programme. Poor delivery
 could offer an explanation for the lack of an effect. 34–36
 The community health club model, as implemented
 under the CBEHPP in this setting in western Rwanda,
 had no effect on any main outcomes. Neither did it
 achieve the broader aims of the CBEHPP campaign,
 including zero open defecation and at least 80% hygienic
 latrine coverage. It had mixed results with respect to
 health behaviours, achieving positive results in some
 outcomes (eg, coverage of improved sanitation and type
 and structure of sanitation facility) but not in others
 (eg, handwashing with soap and water). Our results are
 strictly generalisable only to Rusizi district, but they are
 probably relevant to the rest of Rwanda; therefore, they
 raise questions about the value of implementing this
 intervention at scale with the goal of improving health
 outcomes.
