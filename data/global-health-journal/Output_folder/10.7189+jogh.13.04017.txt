<section> social-emotional
 
<section> in poverty-stricken
 
<section> controlled trial
 
<section> Background Social-emotional ability is key to the
 well-being and future success of children; however, dis-
 parities in social-emotional development during an in-
 dividual’s early age can last a lifetime, which is particu-
 larly evident among children living in poverty-stricken
 areas. We aimed to determine the effectiveness, cost-ef-
 fectiveness, and feasibility of a group-based intervention
 called the Care Group on social-emotional development
 for families living in poverty-stricken counties.
 
<section> Methods We conducted a cluster (township) random-
 ized controlled trial (C-RCT) every two weeks from July
 2019 to June 2020 in a poverty-stricken area located in
 Shanxi, China. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandem-
 ic suspended the implementation of the intervention in
 January 2020. The caregiver-child pairs in the inter-
 vention group participated in 12 group-based sessions
 with a structured curriculum and learning materials
 emphasizing nurturing ability and early childhood de-
 velopment. We applied a difference-in-differences (DID)
 model to estimate the intervention’s impact. The anal-
 ysis follows the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. We
 used standard economic costing methods to estimate
 the cost of implementing the Care Group over the in-
 tervention period and adopted a societal perspective in
 the analysis.
 
<section> Results We included 322 eligible caregiver-child pairs in
 the baseline (intervention n = 136, control n = 186) and
 surveyed 258 pairs in the endline (intervention n = 117,
 control n = 141). Compared with the control group, chil-
 dren in the intervention group had significantly fewer
 social-emotional problems (adjusted mean difference of
 Z score = -0.374, 95% CI = -0.718, -0.030, P = 0.033) six
 months after intervention. In the first year, the annual
 cost of implementing Care Group was US$146.10 per
 child, reduced to US$47.20 per child in the second year
 due to the exclusion of non-recurrent costs. The incre-
 mental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$390.60. 
<section> Conclusions Care Group is an effective approach for promoting children’s social-emotional develop-
 ment in poverty-stricken areas at an affordable cost and with high feasibility for scale-up. Considering
 the planned per capita health expenditure of the Chinese government for 2022, we believe that the pre-
 sented evidence makes a solid scientific and financial case for integrating the Care Group intervention
 into the basic public health services (BPHS) package.

 There is increasing evidence confirming that social-emotional skills serve as the critical foundation for the
 well-being and future success of children; however, disparities in social-emotional development in the early
 years can last a lifetime, particularly evident among children living in poverty [1-3]. Previous studies found
 a prevalence of social-emotional delay ranging from 14% to 59%, with a weighted average of 36.5% among
 infants and toddlers in rural areas of China [4], while the prevalence in the entire Chinese sample was 20%
 [5]. An empirical study also found that the key window of opportunity for improving a child’s development
 is during or prior to the infancy stage [6]. Moreover, nurturing care practices have been positively correlat-
 ed with children’s social and emotional development [7,8].
 
<section> Group-based interventions have the advantages of modeling positive nurturing care behaviors and environ-
 ments [9] and fostering a strong sense of belonging [10] at a lower cost [11]. Smaller group size (2-10 care-
 giver-child pairs), structured curricula, opportunities for practice among caregivers, feedback on nurturing
 care behaviors, and adequate intervention frequency were found to be crucial for successful group-based
 interventions [12]. Based on data from previous studies, the cost of group-based intervention on early child-
 hood development (ECD) was about US$400-933 per child annually in the United States [13] and US$38-
 135 per child annually without non-recurrent costs in India [14].
 
<section> An estimated 17 million children under the age of five in China were denied the opportunity to develop to
 their fullest potential due to various risk factors in 2017, such as child poverty, malnutrition, lack of psy-
 chosocial stimulation, and poor parenting environment [15]. While China has achieved remarkable prog-
 ress in poverty alleviation [16], the incidence of early childhood developmental delays, especially for on
 non-cognitive development [17], has been worse [18,19] in poverty-stricken areas due to persistent wealth
 disparities between urban and rural areas [20].
 
<section> We aimed to examine the effectiveness of the Care Group intervention on social-emotional development
 of children under the age of three, evaluate its cost-effectiveness, and determine the feasibility of the deliv-
 ery paths (eg, facilitator selection, training, supervision) and compliance to its implementation in pover-
 ty-stricken areas in China. The data presented is not only relevant for expanding ECD services for children
 aged 0-3 in poverty-stricken areas of China, but also valuable to other countries with similar social and
 economic situation.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Study design and participants
 
<section> We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial (C-RCT) every two weeks from July to December 2019
 in eight townships of Fenxi County, a poverty-stricken area in Shanxi Province of China [21]. Gross domes-
 tic product (GDP) per capita in Fenxi County in 2019 was US$2151 [22], much lower than that of China
 (US$10 144) [23] and Shanxi Province (US$2465) [24] in 2019. We conducted the endline evaluation survey
 six months later in July 2020 due to the interruption of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The intervention group participated in Care Group Intervention while also receiving child health care ser-
 vices included in the basic public health services (BPHS) package, while the control group received only the
 child health care services included in the BPHS package. We intended for the caregiver-child pairs in the in-
 tervention group to participate in 24 group-based sessions over 12 months between July 2019 to June 2020.
 However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the pairs in the intervention group were only able to participate
 in a maximum of 12 group-based sessions from July to December 2019. Since January 2020, we suspended
 the offline intervention for six months, and facilitators switched to sending age-appropriate messages and
 relative links of nurturing care and child health to caregivers via Wechat (a free mobile application for text
 and voice messaging communication service), to encourage them to keep practicing and maintain positive
 nurturing practices learned before. Intervention to improve social-emotional development of young children
 
<section> Recruited by the village doctors, children who were aged 6-18 months by July 1, 2019, and their primary
 caregivers were eligible for inclusion in the intervention group. Each primary caregiver signed the informed
 consent form after confirming they completely understood the content and information. Exclusion criteria
 for data analysis were: 1) children with physical disabilities; 2) multiple births (eg, twins, triplets); 3) pre-
 mature babies; and 4) children living more than five kilometres from the intervention site.
 
<section> Sample size and power calculation
 
<section> The Care Group Intervention is designed to increase children’s social-emotional development by 0.35 stan-
 dard deviations (SDs). Assuming a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a power of 0.80, we calculated the
 minimum sample size as 102 per group using the G*Power 3.1 software. We estimated a 90% valid data
 and 80% follow-up rate. We thus aimed to recruit 142 participants in each group, with a total 284 partic-
 ipants (142 × 2).
 
<section> Randomization and masking
 
<section> We matched the townships (n = 8) into pairs based on the order of the socioeconomic index (per capita dis-
 posable income in 2018). Each township was marked as A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, and D2 after four pairs
 were decided. We used IBM SPSS V.24.0 (IBM Corp) to randomly choose one number in each pair as the
 intervention township, after which its paired township automatically became a control group. We assigned
 all the children living in intervention/control townships to the intervention/control groups. We could not
 blind the participants and facilitators due to the nature of the Care Group intervention.
 
<section> Care Group intervention
 
<section> The Care Group Manual, developed by the University of Colorado in the United States, has been proven as
 a practical tool to improve the health and development of children aged 0-3, and advance caregivers’ knowl-
 edge and skills on nurturing care in Guatemala [25,26] Adapted to the Chinese context, the Care Group
 Flipchart and the Care Group Toolkit were developed as part of the ECD program (2017-2020) jointly sup-
 ported by UNICEF and the National Health Commission of China.
 
<section> The Care Group intervention aims to promote children’s comprehensive development by strengthening pri-
 mary caregivers’ knowledge and skills on nurturing care practices. The focus of the Care Group content spans
 five key components (good health, adequate nutrition, responsive caregiving, security and safety, and oppor-
 tunities for early learning) under the Nurturing Care Framework promoted by the World Health Organiza-
 tion and UNICEF [27]. We emphasized the five fundamental philosophies (responsive caregiving, sufficient
 early stimulation, play and communication, encouragement and praise, and security) and the corresponding
 nurturing care skills during the entire intervention. After brief lectures on child health and nurturing care
 at the beginning of each session, two facilitators demonstrated nurturing care skills, organized play/read-
 ing interaction activities, and responded to the parents’ and caregivers’ questions. Each session lasted
 minutes and had a structured curriculum. The agenda is available in Figure S1 in the 
<section> Online Supplemen-
 
<section> tary Document. Facilitators recorded participation, children and caregiver performance, and questions/
 feedback after each session. More details on the Care Group can be found in the published protocol [21].
 
<section> Delivery path
 
<section> We delivered the Care Group intervention through the BPHS system at the township level. We established
 a three-tiered supervision mechanism at the national, county and village levels, carrying out quality assur-
 ance at the national and county levels at a quarterly, and at the village level at a monthly basis. We selected
 nine local women (including one health worker, one family planning worker, three experienced volunteers,
 three female caregivers, and one kindergarten teacher) who at least completed senior secondary education
 as facilitators after rounds of interviews and training. We used a two-phase training to help facilitators fa-
 miliarize with the key messages and skills outlined in the Care Group Manual, and the training specifical-
 ly emphasized and demonstrated how to promote positive relationships and cultivate a warm environment
 for participants.
 
<section> Measurement and data analysis
 
<section> We evaluated the children’s social-emotional development using the Ages & Stages Questionnaires: Social
 Emotional, Second Edition (ASQ: SE-2), a caregiver-reported screening tool to identify social-emotional
 problems among children aged 1-72 months; The ASQ: SE-2 has been introduced in many countries and is 
<section> widely used in research and clinical settings. It has been adapted to the Chinese context and approved as
 a reliable tool for assessing the social-emotional development of children aged 0-6 [25]. The tool includes
 16 to 36 questions depending on the specified age group, and caregivers are asked to provide answers on a
 three-point Likert scale. The questions focus on typical behaviors for the specified age group in seven di-
 mensions, including self-regulation, compliance, communication, adaptive functioning, autonomy, affect,
 and interaction with others. The total score is the sum of each question, and a higher score indicates poorer
 social-emotional development.
 
<section> We trained four graduate students to help caregivers log into the ASQ: SE-2 electronic system which pro-
 vides uniform illustration and audio-visual materials. Raw data were automatically uploaded. Child demo-
 graphic characteristics (including gender, age and order of birth) and maternal demographic characteristics
 (including education, marital status, attendance, caregiver’s satisfaction toward intervention and socioeco-
 nomic status) were chosen as control variables. All questionnaires were administered by the GoodData soft-
 ware (GoodData, Beijing, China) using an Android system. We set the range and logistics of each response
 in advance to guarantee data accuracy completeness.
 
<section> According to the rules of the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, we performed the data distribution before
 the data analysis. For the descriptive analysis on the children (age group, gender, and birth order), parents
 (i.e. education, age, and stay-at-home parent) and the family’s socioeconomic status (i.e. annual income in
 2018, vehicle ownership, and household appliance ownership), we used t test or χ 2 test. We applied a dif-
 ference-in-differences (DID) model to estimate the intervention’s impact on the children’s social-emotional
 developmental outcomes. We calculated a Z-score according to each child’s score on ASQ: SE-2 in their age
 group. We reported the odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), coefficient of control variables,
 and their P-values, setting the threshold for statistical significance at P > 0.05 (bilateral). We conducted the
 data analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0.
 
<section> Cost-effectiveness analysis
 
<section> We used standard economic costing methods to estimate the cost of implementing the Care Group over the
 intervention period [28] and adopted a societal perspective in the analysis adopted. We included all inter-
 vention-related costs: recruitment, initial training, group material (e.g. basic parenting pack, books, dolls
 etc.), and care group costs. We collected all costs data through qualitative interviews with implementing
 staff and referenced the intervention budget and expenditure records. We utilized the human capital ap-
 proach [29] to calculate the time cost of all staff. We converted all the calculated costs in 2019 from Chinese
 RMB to US dollars (US$1 = RMB6.908). We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios by dividing the
 intervention costs by the differences between the intervention and control groups in terms of developmen-
 tal outcomes (i.e. overall ASQ: SE-2 Z scores). As we obtained all costs within a one-year time horizon, dis-
 counting costs or effects were not needed. We used univariate sensitivity analyses to determine the impact
 of cost variation by allowing the personnel costs to fluctuate up and down by 50%.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> We recruited 322 children aged 6-18 months recruited in the baseline survey, assigning 136 to the interven-
 tion group and 186 to the control group. The endline survey in July 2020 included 117 children from the
 intervention group (86.03%) and 141 children from the control group (75.81%). Forty-eight caregiver-child
 pairs dropped from the project due to migration (intervention group n = 33; control group n = 15). The spe-
 cific exit time and drop-out reasons from the intervention group are available in Table S1 in the 
<section> Online
 
<section> Supplementary Document. Sixteen caregivers refused to participate in the endline survey (intervention
 group n = 4; control group n = 12) (Figure 1).
 
<section> Comparison of demographic characteristics between intervention and control
 
<section> groups
 
<section> The demographic characteristics were normally distributed. At the baseline, there was no significant differ-
 ence in the demographic characteristics of children (e.g. age group, gender, and birth order) between the in-
 tervention and control groups (Table 1). Mothers in the intervention group were significantly younger than
 those in the control group (intervention = 27.89; SD = 3.44; control = 29.20; SD = 4.13; P = 0.007). We found
 no significant difference in the mother’s level of education, father’s level of education, and age. The propor-
 tion of stay-at-home (not working) mothers was 81.2% in the intervention group and 85.5% in the control

<section> Comparison of social-emotional changes between intervention and control groups
 
<section> The Z-scores in the intervention group were slightly higher than in the control group at the baseline, without
 a significant difference (intervention = 0.099 SD = 1.040; control = -0.082; SD = 0.942; P > 0.05). In the end-
 line survey, however, the Z-scores were significantly lower in the intervention group (intervention = -0.106,
 SD = 0.952; control = 0.088, SD = 1.026; P < 0.05). The alteration (i.e. intervention group minus control group)
 was significantly different (difference-in-difference = -0.374, P < 0.05), demonstrating that children in the
 intervention group had fewer social-emotional problems (95% CI = -0.718, -0.030, P < 0.05,

<section> Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and univariate sensitivity analysis
 
<section> The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with and without non-recurrent costs were US$390.60
 and US$126.20, respectively. The univariate sensitivity analysis showed that the up-and-down variance of
 the personnel costs by 50% yielded intervention costs per child of US$103.70 to US$188.50, with corre-
 sponding ICERs varying from US$277.30 to US$504.00. When non-recurrent fees were excluded, the cost
 per child ranged from US$35.10 to US$59.30, and the ICERs varied from US$93.90 to US$158.60 (Table 4).
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in China to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effective-
 ness of group-based intervention on the social-emotional development of children in poverty-stricken areas.
 The positive findings indicated that the Care Group is scalable. Most importantly, the endline survey found
 that the Care Group had a sustained positive impact on the social-emotional development of children six
 months after the intervention was interrupted by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

<section> The positive effect of group-based intervention on promoting social-emotional development in our find-
 ings was similar to or larger than the effect found by previous studies [4,9]. Hamadani et al. [9] had a much
 larger effect size in Bangladesh because the intervention targeted underweight children and lasted longer.
 Based on our analysis, there are three key factors that contributed to this positive effect. First, a safe and se-
 cure environment is fundamental for children to explore their surroundings and interact with others [30].
 The Care Group provided children with this opportunity and encouraged caregivers to extend positive sur-
 roundings full of stimulate and nurturing care practices at home. Second, modeling played an essential role.
 According to social learning theory [31], children and caregivers tend to learn from observations through
 imitation and internalization. In our study, we focused on improving the nurturing care behaviors through
 lectures and discussions, demonstrations of responsive care practices, and effective feedback for caregivers.
 We also showed that the positive nurturing behaviors in the intervention group significantly increased after
 the intervention (Table S4 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document). One study [32] showed that the link
 between parenting skills and the social-emotional development of children was more vital than the cogni-
 tive, language, and motor development of children. Third, the Care Group provided a valuable opportunity
 for caregivers to openly share their feelings and thoughts. Depressive symptoms, parenting stress, and mar-
 ital adjustment have been significantly associated with maternal sensitivity [33-35] and a mother’s ability
 to promptly and appropriately respond to their infant’s behavioral signals. We found that mothers in the
 intervention group received more peer support, and they were more willing to share their inner thoughts
 and feelings after a few sessions.
 
<section> Cost-effectiveness of the Care Group
 
<section> Several studies targeting group-based intervention on ECD were found to be cost-effective and efficient in
 other countries [36-39]. For example, the Video Interaction Project [40], a targeted intervention in the pe-
 diatric primary care setting designed to enhance parenting skills and boost school readiness in the Unit-
 ed States, has an annual cost of US$150-200 per child. The Incredible Years [41] parenting program in the
 United Kingdom, with costs ranging from £1612-2418 (US$2524-3787) per child depending on the num- 
<section> ber of children in the group, was found to have a high probability of being cost-effective. The cost of our
 group-based intervention adjusted by consumer price indices, ranging from US$50-150, is relatively lower
 and more efficient compared with these programs. Compared with other domestic studies in China, such
 as the one by Shi et al. [42] on parenting intervention and ECD, the average costs are very similar, yet we
 believe the Care Group may be more cost-effective because we implemented our intervention in rural areas
 where children and caregivers have decreased access to resources and services. Moreover, if the number of
 children in each Care Group doubles from four to eight children per group, the average cost of the project
 will be further reduced, greatly increasing the return on investment.
 
<section> From the perspective of government health investment, the public health expenditure per person was
 US$0.32 (RMB2.20), calculated by dividing the total cost of the Care Group by the population of Fenxi
 County (104 627 permanent residents). According to the governmental project report of Basic Public Health
 Service in 2021 [43], Chinese government would increase the per capita public health expenditure by RMB5
 (US$0.72) beginning in 2022. Therefore, available government funds can fully cover the total costs of the
 Care Group.
 
<section> Feasibility of scaling up the Care Group nationwide
 
<section> We found the implementation of the Care Group to be feasible regarding the delivery path, facilitator selec-
 tion, capacity building, and materials preparation. The three-tiered “national-county-village” supervision
 mechanism relied on the existing health system and guaranteed the quality of the implementation of the
 Care Group. This supervision mechanism provided an excellent preliminary foundation for sample enrol-
 ment, facilitator recruitment, training, and regular supervision.
 
<section> While selecting potential facilitators, we prioritized a candidate’s capacity for empathy, their level of respon-
 sibility and communication, and relevant work experience. With the continuous improvement of education
 access among women and the growing awareness of the importance of ECD in rural areas of China, many
 full-time mothers of children under the age of three have been great candidates as facilitators. We also en-
 sured sufficient pre-intervention training and frequent capacity building. According to the feedback from
 supervisors, the two-week training before implementation of the intervention and the high frequency of
 trainings in the first three months of implementation played an essential role in developing and improving
 the skills of supervisors and facilitators.
 
<section> Finally, the Care Group Toolkit materials were economical, portable, and substitutable (see Table S5 in the
 
<section> Online Supplementary Document), allowing caregivers the possibility to purchase or make similar toys.
 This was beneficial for the creation of home-based early learning opportunities. We believe that our find-
 ings demonstrate the scalability of the Care Group intervention to a national level and its potential for inte-
 gration the Care Group into the BPHC package.
 
<section> Limitation
 
<section> Our study had some limitations. The increasingly apparent circumstance of frequent migration between
 the townships and the nearby urban areas impacted both enrolment and participation. With better edu-
 cational and medical resources, job opportunities, and recreational facilities, young parents tend to work
 in nearby counties or urban areas. Meanwhile, they choose to settle down in the townships because of the
 low level of consumption [44]. Another limitation was the interruption of the Care Group intervention due
 to the COVID-19 pandemic. We could neither implement the intervention on-site nor adequately assess
 the immediate outcome and the social-emotional development of children. To adapt to the COVID-19 con-
 text, local facilitators used WeChat to maintain limited online interaction with caregivers. While we did
 not survey and quantify the level that the caregivers put into effect, this might be a reason of the sustained
 effect. This is also an interference factor for cost-effectiveness. Because the network system in China is very
 convenient and inexpensive, we had no expense for training and supervision in message transferring; we
 assumed no economic input was included during the epidemic period. The effect immediately after inter-
 vention was supposed to be greater than it was six months later, so we still believe the current results to be
 conservative and credible.
 
<section> Further study
 
<section> During the implementation, we were concerned with the overall participation rate (Online 
<section> Supplementary
 
<section> Document). Lack of awareness and attention on ECD were also related to some caregivers’ absence. Strate-
 gies to alleviate these difficulties should be considered in future studies. Moreover, researchers can further Intervention to improve social-emotional development of young children
 
<section> explore diversified forms of intervention. For example, a mixed media approach may be more engaging and
 interactive for caregivers and children; intervention frequency can be altered to examine the most appro-
 priate frequency; and caregiver-only sessions can be implemented to assist in deeper learning of nurturing
 care knowledge and sharing of feelings and challenges with less distraction.
 
<section> CONCLUSIONS
 
<section> The Care Group is an effective approach for promoting social-emotional development of young children in
 poverty-stricken areas at an affordable cost and with high feasibility for scale-up. Considering the planned
 per capita health expenditure of the Government of China for 2022, we believe that the evidence present-
 ed makes a solid scientific and financial case for integrating the Care Group intervention into the BPHS
 package.
