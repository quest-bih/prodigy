<section> Abstract
 
<section> In Shared Medical Appointments (SMAs), patients with similar conditions meet the physician
 together and each receives one-on-one attention. SMAs can improve outcomes and physi-
 cian productivity. Yet privacy concerns have stymied adoption. In physician-deprived
 nations, patients’ utility from improved access may outweigh their disutility from loss of pri-
 vacy. Ours is to our knowledge the first SMA trial for any disease, in India, where doctors
 are scarce. In a 1,000-patient, single-site, randomized controlled trial at Aravind Eye Hospi-
 tal, Pondicherry, we compared SMAs and one-on-one appointments, over four successive
 visits, for patients with glaucoma. We examined patients’ satisfaction, knowledge, intention-
 to-follow-up, follow-up rates, and medication compliance rates (primary outcomes) using
 intention-to-treat analysis. Of 1,034 patients invited between July 12, 2016 –July 19, 2018,
 1,000 (96.7%) consented to participate, and were randomly assigned to either SMAs (N SMA
 
<section> = 500) or one-on-one appointments (N 1-1 = 500). Patients who received SMAs showed
 higher satisfaction (Mean SMA = 4.955 (SD 0.241), Mean 1-1 = 4.920 (SD 0.326); difference
 means 0.035; 95% CI, 0.017–0.054, p = 0.0002) and knowledge (Mean SMA = 3.416 (SD
 
<section> 1.340), Mean 1-1 = 3.267 (SD 1.492); difference in means 0.149; 95% CI, 0.057–0.241, p =
 0.002) than patients who received one-on-one appointments. Across conditions, there was
 no difference in patients’ intention-to-follow-up (Mean SMA = 4.989 (SD 0.118), Mean 1-1 =
 4.986 (SD 0.149); difference in means 0.003; 95% CI, -0.006–0.012, p = 0.481) and actual
 follow-up rates (Mean SMA = 87.5% (SD 0.372), Mean 1-1 = 88.7% (SD 0.338); difference in
 means -0.012; 95% CI, -0.039–0.015, p = 0.377). Patients who received SMAs exhibited
 higher medication compliance rates (Mean SMA = 97.0% (SD 0.180), Mean 1-1 = 94.9% (SD
 0.238); difference in means 0.020; 95% CI, 0.004–0.036, p = 0.013). SMAs improved satis-
 faction, learning, and medication compliance, without compromising follow-up rates or mea-
 sured clinical outcomes. Peer interruptions were negatively correlated with patient

<section> Introduction
 
<section> The demand for healthcare worldwide is soaring and exceeds supply. Public healthcare provi-
 sion in low and low-middle income countries (LLMICs) is especially scarce [1–3]. Yet in most
 LLMICs, access to private care offered by qualified providers is the privilege of the relatively
 wealthy. For example, India’s poorest citizens resort to either informal healthcare providers
 [4, 5] or immensely-crowded government care facilities with long waits–often resulting in
 delayed care or no care at all [6].
 A highly-cited review of care quality in LLMICs published over a decade ago called for ways
 to improve the quality of both publicly and privately-provided care, by improving care delivery
 and outcomes for the poor, and better managing the burden of chronic diseases [7]. Accord-
 ingly, physicians, healthcare administrators, and policy makers worldwide continue to seek
 and implement new service delivery models to improve the efficiency and efficacy of health-
 care delivery. One such model, introduced over two decades ago in the United States, is the
 shared medical appointment (SMA) [8]. In an SMA, multiple patients with the same condition
 meet with the physician in a group, and each receives one-on-one attention in turn. In a one-
 on-one appointment, the physician shares both customized information, tailored to a patient’s
 specific needs, and standardized information that is also relevant to other patients with the
 same condition. SMAs reduce the repetition of standardized information while enabling the
 entire group to hear the physician’s answers to questions posed by individual patients. Thus,
 SMAs have the potential to facilitate learning, while cutting costs by reducing physician time
 per patient.
 The productivity gains from SMAs have been shown to be considerable [8–10]. In “drop-
 in” shared medical appointments, a patient’s peers may vary from one SMA to the next, and
 productivity increases are typically 300% or higher [8]. As an example, in the US, a routine
 one-on-one appointment for cardiac preventive care can take 30 minutes, whereas a cardiolo-
 gist may see 8–10 patients for this purpose in a 90-minute SMA, a 300% productivity improve-
 ment [11]. The productivity gains from SMAs could fuel expanded access to public healthcare
 and might also lower the price-point for accessing care privately. Also, because physicians
 divide their time across SMAs and one-on-one appointments, the improved productivity in
 SMAs reduces waiting times even for patients who choose not to attend SMAs, resulting in
 waiting time reductions of as much as 70% [10]. Moreover, a growing body of evidence from
 high-income countries (HICs) suggests that SMAs can yield superior medical outcomes for
 wide variety of conditions, including neonatal care, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascu-
 lar disease, and most notably type-2 diabetes, in both primary and secondary care settings
 [12, 13]. Conducive to their implementation, NHS England & Improvement in the UK offers
 training in the use of SMAs in primary care [14]. In the US, payors offer highly favourable
 reimbursement rates for SMAs [15]. SMAs have been implemented successfully for chronic
 disease follow up and for other non-urgent care [13].
 Nevertheless, despite evidence of their efficiency and efficacy, availability of training and
 favourable reimbursement rates, SMAs adoption in HICs–except by a few leading providers, 
<section> e.g., Kaiser Permanente and the Cleveland Clinic in the United States–has been extremely lim-
 ited [13]. Doctors and patients alike fear that the loss of privacy that is inherent to shared
 appointments may hinder the discussion of sensitive medical issues [16], and dampen patients’
 learning, satisfaction, and engagement [17]. More time with the doctor during one-on-one
 appointments is known to improve patients’ knowledge and satisfaction [18], but little is
 known about how patients’ experience and behaviour is impacted when a physician’s time is
 shared among a group of patients [12].
 In HICs, when SMAs are offered, patients are typically choosing between an SMA available
 at short notice vs. a one-on-one appointment on a later date. Since SMAs are for non-urgent
 care, patients may prefer to wait–to avail of the privacy of a one-on-one visit. In stark contrast,
 if SMAs were offered in poorer subpopulations in LLMICs, patients would likely face a very
 different choice: attending an SMA vs. receiving no qualified care at all. Faced with this trade-
 off, disutility from the loss of privacy may be outweighed by the utility gains from access to
 care. However, there is virtually no adoption of, or research on, SMAs in LLMICs. We
 searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for articles on shared medical appointments
 (SMAs) published as of Nov. 26, 2022, using combinations of search terms for systematic
 reviews, shared medical appointments, group appointments or group visits. We also searched
 for articles on SMAs from Asia, Africa and Latin America, and for articles on SMAs for eye
 disease. (See S1 Appendix page 2 for search details.) To our knowledge, only 7 randomized
 controlled trials have evaluated SMAs across Asia, Africa, and Latin America–where health-
 care demand far exceeds its supply–with none in India, a country with almost a fifth of the
 world’s population, that spends only 1.1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health and
 faces a dire shortage of healthcare capacity [2]. In 2021, the Chief Scientist of the World Health
 Organization (WHO) called for research on SMAs in the developing world [19].
 Although SMAs have received no attention in India, recent community-based research in
 India suggests that shared care delivery is both feasible and promising. Community health
 worker (CHW)–led group-based education and monitoring has been shown to reduce blood
 pressure [20]; facilitator-supported women’s groups for perinatal care in Mumbai slums found
 evidence of behaviour change, despite no population-level effects on health care or mortality
 [21]; and a community-based peer-support lifestyle intervention led to type-2 diabetes preven-
 tion by lay peers while significantly improving some cardiovascular risk factors and physical
 functioning [22].
 To study the effect of shared care delivery in the context of medical appointments, we con-
 ducted, to our knowledge, the first randomized controlled trial of SMAs for any disease in
 India, which is also only the th trial of SMAs across Asia, Africa and Latin America. Ours is
 also, to our knowledge, the first SMAs trial for glaucoma–which is a chronic condition that
 requires regular follow-up appointments and the second biggest cause of blindness worldwide.
 It is also distinguished among prior pragmatic randomized controlled trials of SMAs by its
 scale (most SMA trials have investigated fewer patients), its single-site nature (most large SMA
 trials have been conducted across multiple sites), and the extent to which, by design, aspects
 the patient experience beyond the composition of the appointment itself have been carefully
 controlled. Our goal was to assess how SMAs affect two important aspects of patients’ experi-
 ence (knowledge gained and satisfaction) and two key behavioural outcomes (follow-up rates
 and medication compliance rates), while also examining two clinical outcomes (change in
 intraocular pressure (ΔIOP) and change in optic nerve head cup-to-disc ratio (ΔONH)) for
 patients with primary glaucoma as secondary outcomes. Additionally, we examined physician
 time per patient and aimed to explore how patients’ perceptions of shared appointments
 changed as they gained more experience with this format, by analysing verbal and nonverbal
 engagement measures obtained via video recording of every appointment. 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Ethics statement
 
<section> This study was approved by the ethics review boards at the Aravind Eye Hospital, Pondicherry,
 London Business School and Harvard Business School. All study participants provided written
 informed consent prior to participating in the study. The trial was registered with Clinical Tri-
 als Registry of India with reference no. REF/2016/11/012659 and registration no. CTRI/2018/
 02/011998. The trial protocol and amendments can be found in the supporting information
 
<section> (S2 Appendix).
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> We conducted a large-scale, single-site, randomized controlled trial at the Aravind Eye Hospi-
 tal in Pondicherry, India, which is one of 6 tertiary eye hospitals in the Aravind Eye Care Sys-
 tem (AECS) in Southern India. AECS has served as a WHO Collaborating Centre, serves 4.5
 million patients a year and trains over 300 hospitals across Africa and Asia in methods to
 deliver high-quality, low-cost care [23–25]. The Aravind Eye Hospital, Pondicherry’s glau-
 coma clinic, where we conducted our trial, has five glaucoma consultants and four glaucoma
 fellows who collectively serve approximately 180 patients per day. In March 2023, the Aravind
 Eye Hospital, Pondicherry glaucoma clinic’s median time from registration to exit was
 minutes, median waiting time was 154 minutes, and median consultation time was 6 minutes.
 In our trial, 1,000 patients with primary glaucoma were randomly assigned to either attend
 SMAs with four other patients (N 
<section> SMA = 500), or one-on-one appointments (N 
<section> 1-1 = 500), dur-
 ing four successive routine follow-up visits scheduled four months apart. Enrolment occurred
 over two years.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> A glaucoma specialist on our research team reviewed the medical records of incoming patients
 to identify those who were eligible for our study. Eligible patients had primary glaucoma with
 no other vision-threatening conditions and had undergone no more than one surgery in each
 eye. Patients who had undergone a tube/shunt surgery in the past, were monocular, were likely
 to require surgical intervention soon, or were part of another trial, were excluded.
 Eligible patients were invited to enrol in the trial. S1 Table provides a comparison of the
 demographics of the 34 patients who declined to participate with those of the 1,000 patients
 who enrolled.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 
<section> Enrolled patients were randomly assigned in groups of five to either the treatment arm
 (SMAs) or the control arm (one-on-one appointments) by means of a random number gener-
 ator, which ensured allocation concealment [26]. Throughout the trial, medical appointments
 for patients in the treatment and control arms were scheduled to occur at different times, so
 to avoid bias due to patients in one condition observing the experiences of patients in the
 other condition. As ours was a service delivery intervention, it was not possible to mask
 patients and study doctors on our research team to group assignment.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> Outside of our intervention, there were no systematic differences in the number or nature of
 physician interactions, nor in any other aspect of patient care [12]. Upon arriving in the Glau-
 coma Clinic, all patients met with a mid-level ophthalmic professional and a junior glaucoma 
<section> consultant, and underwent all or some of the following steps, depending on their disease stage
 and care requirements: patient medical history review, vision check, eye pressure check, field
 analysis and preliminary testing, dilation, and optical coherence tomography. After these ini-
 tial steps, patients were escorted to a waiting room to await their medical appointments with
 one of the investigators (SK, RV). Both of the investigators were fellowship-trained glaucoma
 consultants with more than 10 years of experience who are well versed with the local language.
 The selection of these two investigators balanced care experience across providers and enabled
 us to avoid language barriers.
 Our intervention determined whether groups of patients whose appointments were sched-
 uled proximally were seen separately (in consecutive one-on-one appointments) or together
 (in an SMA). During their appointments, patients in the control arm (who received one-on-
 one appointments) experienced an eye examination, before receiving individualized recom-
 mendations from the doctor. Patients in the treatment arm (who received shared medical
 appointments) entered the appointment room together and waited their turn to experience
 eye examination, before receiving individualized recommendations from the doctor. Patients
 experienced SMAs in groups of five during their first appointments and concluded their visit
 by scheduling their next appointment with a study coordinator. If the need arose due to
 changes in a patient’s or a doctor’s availabilities, the coordinator would reschedule the patient,
 as well as other enrolled patients, to fill in gaps in groups. Managing patients in both arms in
 groups enabled us to use identical scheduling and reminder procedures to ensure consistent
 experiences beyond the experimental manipulation. Nevertheless, due to such rescheduling,
 group size in follow-up SMAs varied from 2–6 patients (Mean = 4.262, SD = 0.991). Patients
 in both arms were welcome to ask questions at any time during their appointments. In one-
 on-one appointments, questions arose as a natural extension of the conversation between the
 doctor and the patient. In SMAs, after administering recommendations to the last patient, the
 doctor asked whether anyone in the group had questions. In both arms, an appointment
 ended naturally when there were no more questions.
 All data–including physician notes, demographic information on each patient: age, gender,
 urban or rural residence, and education level, as well as medical information: glaucoma type,
 and the existence of relevant comorbidities–were recorded in participating patients’ case report
 forms as described in the protocol provided in the supporting information (S2 Appendix). After
 each appointment, patients in both arms responded to a survey with questions assessing their
 satisfaction with the appointment, their knowledge about glaucoma, and their intention to
 return for a follow-up appointment (see S2 Table).
 At the conclusion of the survey, patients were scheduled for their next appointment. An
 identical procedure was used to schedule or reschedule follow-up appointments for patients
 both arms. One week and again one day prior to each appointment, the study coordinators
 called patients in both arms to remind them of their upcoming appointment.
 Every appointment was videotaped with consent using a wall-mounted camera. The total
 time spent by the doctor on each patient group (in an SMA or in consecutive one-on-one
 appointments), and interruption measures, were obtained from this recording.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> For each patient, we examined four primary outcomes: satisfaction, knowledge, patient-
 reported medication compliance rate, and follow-up rate. Our secondary outcomes were two
 key medical outcomes–change in intraocular pressure (ΔIOP) and change in optic nerve head
 cup-to-disc ratio (ΔONH) over 4 visits–appointment durations, as well as the number of verbal
 interruptions and gestures made by peers during each patient’s examination. 
<section> Patient satisfaction and knowledge levels were measured at the end of each appointment.
 We recorded patient satisfaction levels on multiple dimensions (satisfaction with the appoint-
 ment, with the degree to which their doubts were addressed, with their levels of learning, and
 with the degree to which they understood instructions) using a 5-point scale. We assessed each
 patient’s knowledge level about glaucoma by administering a 5-question multiple choice test.
 To assess intended and actual follow-up rates, at the end of each appointment we asked
 patients to report their intention to return for a follow-up visit. We subsequently tracked their
 follow-up behaviour, in particular, whether they returned within 30 days of their next sched-
 uled appointment.
 During each appointment, medication compliance rates were reported by each patient to
 the doctor. Doctors subsequently assessed each patient’s condition through an eye examina-
 tion by measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) and optic nerve head cup-to-disc ratio (ONH)
 levels. Since these measures tend to evolve slowly over time, ΔIOP (in mm Hg) and ΔONH (in
 mm) were calculated as the change in each measure from the first to the last appointment in
 the trial, which was 12 months by design (Mean = 13.211, SD = 1.855). For each patient, demo-
 graphics, glaucoma type and systemic comorbidities were recorded at the start of the trial. All
 survey and knowledge assessment questions are included in S2 Table.
 Videos of the appointments in both arms were transcribed and decoded to obtain measures
 of verbal and non-verbal engagement dynamics among the patients and physicians, as well as
 to measure appointment durations. Appointment durations were used to estimate physician
 time per patient.
 Patient health and safety were continually monitored by the physicians engaged in the trial.
 As our trial involved no direct medical interventions, no adverse events were identified.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> As we mention in our study protocol in the S2 Appendix, we determined the sample size for
 our trial by using effect sizes in line with prior research on shared medical appointments [27],
 and conducting power analyses using data gathered prior to the start of our trial, on knowledge
 levels and follow-up rates of patients who experienced pilot SMAs and regular one-on-one
 appointments.
 Using a 10-point knowledge survey administered to 50 patients attending pilot SMAs and
 50 patients attending regular one-on-one appointments prior to the start of our trial, the mean
 knowledge in the SMAs arm was 6.68 (SD = 2.00) and the mean knowledge in the one-on-one
 arm was 6.18 (SD = 2.07) using the power method [28]. The mean difference in knowledge lev-
 els was 0.5. Using α = 0.01 and β = 0.10, we estimated the required sample size to be
 patients in each arm. Using a similar method, we also examined follow up rate for patients in
 pilot SMAs and regular one-on-one appointments prior to our trial start and obtained a simi-
 lar sample size. Based on these analyses we chose an initial target sample size of 1,000 (with
 500 patients in each condition). As we had specified that we would do in our protocol, we used
 trial data collected in the first month of the trial to further calibrate the sample size and decided
 to continue with 1,000 as our target sample size (500 in each arm). Continuous outcomes were
 analysed using linear regression and binary outcomes were analysed using logistic regression.
 For both regression types, dependent variables were patient outcomes and the predictor was
 dummy variable that denoted whether the patient was a part of the SMA treatment. We pres-
 ent our outcomes as predicted means (SD) for both trial arms. Standard errors were clustered
 at the patient level. Results are presented as mean differences. We note and show in S3 Table
 that all results are substantively similar when we control for the patient’s biological sex, age,
 urbanity, the presence of comorbidities, and education level, as well as an indicator variable 
<section> denoting the identity of the doctor. For ordinal outcomes, while for ease of exposition we used
 linear regression, we acknowledge that such models have some limitations. Our results are
 robust to the use of generalized ordered logit regressions for the treatment effect on our ordi-
 nal outcomes (see S32–S37 Tables) [29].
 Five different subgroup analyses were performed based on patients’ sex, age, urban vs. rural
 residence, education, and comorbidities. The treatment effect within each subgroup was exam-
 ined by including appropriate treatment-by-subgroup interaction variables in the regression
 models. Pairwise comparisons of the predicted means (SD) were reported after running these
 regressions to calculate the treatment effect within each subgroup with a 95% confidence inter-
 val. A chi-squared test was used to determine whether the effects of SMAs and one-on-one
 appointments differed across subgroups in each analysis. We note, and show in S4–S22 Tables
 that all results are substantively similar when we control for the patient’s biological sex, age,
 urbanity, the presence of comorbidities, and education level, as well as an indicator variable
 denoting the identity of the doctor. All analyses were generated using STATA software version
 
<section> IC 14.2.
 As patient safety was not assessed to be compromised by this intervention, a data monitor-
 ing committee was not formed to oversee this study. Our trial was registered through Clinical
 Trial Registry in India with reference number REF/2016/11/012659 and registration number
 CTRI/2018/02/011998.

<section> Results
 
<section> From July 12, 2016 through July 19, 2018, a total of 1,034 patients were identified as being eligi-
 ble for the trial and were invited to participate. Of those invited, 1,000 (96.7%) consented to
 participate (Fig 1). We analyse the data from these patients, 500 (50%) of whom experienced
 SMAs and 500 (50%) of whom experienced one-on-one appointments. Details of participants’
 baseline characteristics in each group are provided in Table 1. Of our participants, 38% lived
 in rural areas, over half had at most secondary school education, 42% were female and 37%
 were diabetic.
 The results for each primary outcome are provided in Table 2. Relative to patients who
 experienced one-on-one appointments, patients who received SMAs reported significantly
 higher levels of satisfaction with their appointments on three out of four measured dimen-
 sions, exhibited higher levels of knowledge about glaucoma, and reported higher medication
 compliance rates.
 On a 5-point scale, patients’ overall satisfaction with the appointment was 4.955 (SD 0.241)
 among patients who experienced SMAs and 4.920 (SD 0.326) among patients who experienced
 one-on-one appointments (difference in means 0.035; 95% CI, 0.017–0.054, p = 0.0002).
 Patients who experienced SMAs also reported higher satisfaction with the degree to which
 their doubts were addressed (difference in means 0.036; 95% CI, 0.019–0.054, p = 0.0001) and
 with their levels of learning (difference in means 0.090; 95% CI, 0.059–0.121, p<0.0001).
 Patients reported an insignificant difference in satisfaction with understanding instructions
 across SMAs and one-on-one appointments (difference in means 0.006; 95% CI, -0.007–0.018,
 p = 0.362).
 Consistent with their higher reported satisfaction with the degree to which their doubts
 were addressed and their levels of learning, patients in SMAs exhibited higher knowledge

 ence in means 0.149; 95% CI, 0.057–0.241, p = 0.002). Moreover, the patient-reported medica-
 tion compliance rate was significantly higher for patients who experienced SMAs: 0.970 (SD
 0.180) in SMAs and 0.949 (SD 0.238) in one-on-one appointments (difference in means 0.020;

 ferences in intended or actual follow-up rates, nor were there significant differences in ΔIOP
 
<section> or ΔONH during the period of our study. Results for these secondary outcomes are in S5–S8
 Tables. S23–S30 Tables demonstrate baseline medication compliance rates, probability of
 returning within 30 days of the scheduled appointment date, intraocular pressure, and optic
 nerve head cup-to-disc ratio levels in both arms when the trial started. Physician time per
 patient was 3.446 minutes (SD 0.803) in the treatment arm and 3.041 minutes (SD 0.690) in
 the control arm (difference in means 0.405; 95% CI, 0.356–0.454, p<0.0001).
 Across five subgroup analyses for each of the four primary outcomes, SMAs were in no case
 detrimental to a subgroup. Analyses that showed statistically significant differences across sub-
 groups are described below. We observed significant subgroup effects for the medication com-
 pliance rate in two of five subgroup analyses (see Table 3). For female patients, the medication
 compliance rate was 0.987 (SD 0.126) in SMAs and 0.943 (SD 0.260) in one-on-one appoint-

<section> Discussion
 
<section> In this randomized controlled trial, which is, to our knowledge, the first trial of SMAs in India,
 and first SMAs trial worldwide for glaucoma, we examined the performance of SMAs relative
 to one-on-one appointments for regular follow up of patients with glaucoma, at the Aravind
 Eye Hospital, Pondicherry. We find that relative to one-on-one appointments, SMAs

 tion and knowledge, and one key behavioural outcome–medication compliance rate, with no
 significant difference in a second key behavioural outcome–follow-up rate. Patients in both
 arms were equally stable during the trial, based on two medical outcomes–ΔIOP and ΔONH.
 
<section> Physician time per patient was higher in the treatment arm.
 Patients who were randomly assigned to receive SMAs reported higher levels of satisfaction
 with their appointments, with their doubts being addressed and with their levels of learning.
 is important to note that these significant improvements in satisfaction were detected despite
 high baseline satisfaction levels in the control group across all measured dimensions
 (Mean>4.807/5.000 in all cases). The significant improvement in medication compliance rates
 arising from SMAs was similarly striking. Despite a high baseline medication compliance rate
 of 94.9% (SD 0.238) for patients who received one-on-one appointments, a 39% reduction in
 non-compliance was observed among patients who were randomly assigned to receive SMAs.
 Fig 2 shows that after the first trial appointment, the percentage of non-compliant patients fell
 significantly in both arms. We found that patients who were assigned to receive SMAs exhib-
 ited significantly lower non-compliance rates in trial appointments 2–4 (because non-compli-
 ance is measured at the start of each appointment, non-compliance in trial appointment 1 was
 not impacted by our intervention). The improvement in non-compliance in the treatment arm
 suggests that SMAs may be well-suited to increase medication compliance in developing coun-
 tries, where compliance with medication is known to be lower than in developed countries
 [30]. Future work can also delve into the effect sizes of SMAs on other patient outcomes.
 The large sample size in this trial enabled additional investigations of the primary outcomes
 through five subgroup analyses, based on sex, urban vs. rural residence, age, education level,
 and comorbidities. We find that SMAs differentially impact medication compliance rates for
 subgroups based on sex and age. Specifically, our subgroup analyses reveal that the beneficial
 impact of SMAs on medication compliance rates is significantly greater for female patients.
 That women benefited from SMAs is heartening considering that India ranks nd out of
 countries on the World Economic Forum’s global gender gap index [31], mortality and care
 access is lower for girls and women globally [32], and women are more likely than men to be
 sight impaired [33]. The beneficial impact of SMAs on medication compliance rates is also sig-
 nificantly greater for patients aged 65 or younger.
 Although SMAs have been shown to improve efficiency and outcomes in HICs [12], loss
 privacy has severely hampered their adoption [34, 35]. Our results indicate that in our Indian
 sample, patients’ satisfaction is higher in shared appointments, and that through SMAs,
 patients’ knowledge levels and medication compliance rates are improved. Our exit survey
 indicate that patients viewed SMAs as more fair than one-on-one appointments, felt more at
 ease in SMAs, and felt that the physician was more caring towards both them and their fellow
 patients, in SMAs (see S31 Table). Patients also perceived that the physician spent more time
 with them individually in an SMA (see S31 Table).
 To further explore privacy concerns, we used video recordings (obtained with consent) of
 every trial SMA, to identify instances when a patient’s one-on-one time with the doctor was
 interrupted by a peer’s comment or gesture. S1 and S2 Figs, which plot patient satisfaction
 against interruptions, provide descriptive evidence that interruptions by their peers at first
 hurt patient satisfaction, but with experience of SMAs, patients grew to value such interruptive
 interactions.
 In our trial, physician time per patient in the control arm was 3.04 minutes (vs. about 8–10
 minutes in US-based glaucoma studies [36, 37]). The dramatically lower time per patient at
 our trial site reflects AECS’s design philosophy: senior doctors perform only those tasks that
 cannot be performed by junior doctors or other staff [38]. Also, at the Aravind Eye Hospital, 
<section> Pondicherry, patients are given a follow-up appointment date, but no scheduled time slot. An
 appointment finishes when there are no more questions. Because patients in SMAs asked
 more questions, doctor time per patient was 13.32% more in SMAs than in one-on-one
 appointments. Importantly, however, our related research from the same trial indicates that
 a duration of 80% of the average duration of five consecutive one-on-one appointments, SMAs
 resulted in the same number of questions asked [39]. This indicates that the Aravind Eye Hos-
 pital, Pondicherry glaucoma clinic could have improved information exchange while reducing
 physician time per patient, by shortening the duration of the SMAs. Also, in our trial we kept
 peers together over the trial appointments, to enable easier implementation of the experiment.
 In practice, “drop in” SMAs, in which the peers may vary from one appointment to the next,
 result in greater productivity gains by design [9].
 We studied patients with glaucoma, a disease for which patients may be less concerned
 about privacy. Moreover, glaucoma appointments are quite protocol-based and therefore may
 be more amenable to a group format than appointments for other conditions. In HICs, SMAs
 have been successfully implemented for a wide range of conditions. Future research in
 LLMICs should investigate the effects of SMAs on the experiences and behaviours of patients
 with other diseases.
 Although our results are robust and consequential, we cannot pinpoint with this rando-
 mised controlled trial the exact underlying mechanisms that drive observed differences in out-
 comes between SMAs and one-on-one appointments. Nevertheless, our findings that more
 doubts are addressed, and that greater learning occurs in SMAs, may contribute to the greater
 satisfaction and knowledge gained in SMAs, and to patients’ increased willingness to adhere
 prescribed medications. Future work could delve more deeply into the mechanisms underly-
 ing these relationships and explore the impact of SMAs in a broader array of conditions and
 contexts. In HICs SMAs have been studied most widely for type-2 diabetes, a disease with high
 prevalence with LLMICs, and for many other diseases pertinent to the world’s poorest
 populations.
 As many of the world’s poorest billion reside in rural areas in LLMICs [2], one potentially
 promising application of SMAs is in telehealth. By enabling a lower yet profitable price point–
 as with in person SMAs–virtual SMAs could spur private provision of telehealth in rural areas
 [19]. Also, as online care delivery may feel isolating, bringing together groups of patients
 online may foster the satisfaction, knowledge, and compliance benefits observed in this study,
 while also providing social connection. Indeed, just as shared learning environments in class-
 rooms around the world gave way to shared online learning in the shadow of the global
 COVID-19 pandemic, virtual SMAs might enhance the efficacy and efficiency of online
 patient care [14, 40], and we leave this promising area of inquiry to future scholars.
 Taken together, this study suggests that SMAs can improve patient satisfaction, knowledge,
 and medication compliance, without compromising follow-up rates, change in intraocular
 pressure (ΔIOP) or change in optic nerve head cup-to-disc ratio (ΔONH) for patients with
 glaucoma–results which may help allay concerns about the viability of SMAs, spurring further
 consideration of this care delivery model worldwide, and in LLMICs in particular [15]. The
 high representation of less-educated, rural, diabetic, and female patients in our sample suggests
 that SMAs may be valued in underprivileged LLMIC populations.
 More satisfied and knowledgeable patients are likely to engage more in their own health
 care, which is consistent with the higher medication compliance rate observed in our trial [41].
 For chronic conditions, low medication compliance rates and low follow-up rates for regular
 appointments are known to catalyse adverse events that result in expensive hospitalizations
 and degraded patient quality of life. Because the documented improvements in health out-
 comes from SMAs in HICs are likely a result of patients’ experience and behaviours, and 
<section> acceptance of SMAs may be culture-specific, further careful scientific evidence on how SMAs
 affect patient-experience-related outcomes and patient behaviours in other chronic disease
 contexts is needed for hospital systems and policy makers to encourage wider implementation
 of SMAs in primary and secondary care settings, in both HICs and LLMICs.
