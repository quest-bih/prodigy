<section> Abstract
 
<section> Patient experiences and perspectives on trial participation and follow-up may influence their
 compliance with research procedures or negatively impact their well-being. We aimed to
 explore the acceptability and feasibility of home-based and hospital-based follow-up modali-
 ties among COVID-19 patients enrolled in the ANTICOV ANRS COV33 Coverage-Africa
 trial in Burkina Faso and Guinea. The trial (2021–2022) evaluated the efficacy of treatments
 to prevent clinical worsening among COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms.
 Patients were either based at home or hospitalized, as per national recommendations, and
 followed-up through face-to-face visits and phone calls. We conducted a mixed-methods
 sub-study administering a questionnaire to all consenting participants and individually inter-
 viewing purposively selected participants. We performed descriptive analyses of Likert
 scale questions for the questionnaires and thematic analysis for the interviews. We con-
 ducted framework analysis and interpretation. Of the 400 trial patients, 220 completed the
 questionnaire (n = 182 in Burkina Faso, n = 38 in Guinea) and 24 were interviewed (n =
 and n = 8, respectively). Participants were mostly followed-up at home in Burkina Faso; all
 patients from Guinea were first hospitalized, then followed-up at home. Over 90% of partici-
 pants were satisfied with follow-up. Home follow-up was considered acceptable if (i) partici-
 pants perceived they were not severely ill, (ii) it was combined with telemedicine, and (iii) the
 risk of stigma could be avoided. Hospital-based follow-up was viewed as a way to prevent

 development of home-based follow-up for mildly ill patients in West-Africa, provided that
 both emotional and cognitive factors at individual, familial/inter-relational, healthcare and
 national levels be addressed when planning the implementation of a trial, or developing any
 public health strategy.
 
<section> Introduction
 
<section> The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health systems and societies over the world. Despite
 the relatively low number of confirmed cases [1], the virus causing COVID-19 has spread
 widely on the African continent, with an estimated rate of two-thirds (65.1%) of Africans hav-
 ing been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [2].
 The response of national health authorities to the COVID-19 pandemic and crisis, whether
 in terms of prevention, management and treatment guidelines, has differed between African
 countries and has evolved over time. The previous Ebola Virus epidemic in Guinea, Liberia,
 and Sierra Leone played an important role in triggering partial or full lockdowns of uninfected
 persons and/or isolation of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the current
 COVID-19 pandemic [3, 4]. In some countries for instance, all people with COVID-19 were
 immediately and strictly isolated in healthcare facilities, while in others, only people with severe
 COVID-19 symptoms were hospitalized and milder cases were asked to self-isolate at home [5].
 In addition, mainly because this emerging epidemic disease was not well understood at first and
 effective treatments were lacking back in 2020, many people expressed fear of contamination
 and death [6–8]. Stigmatization towards those sick and recovered from COVID-19 has thus
 been reported [9–12], especially in settings that have faced the recent Ebola epidemic [13].
 A large number of clinical trials have been conducted over the world [14] to find safe and
 efficient treatments for COVID-19, but very few have been conducted in Africa [15]. While
 some hospital-based trials aimed to reduce the risk of death among hospitalized COVID-19
 patients with severe symptoms, others aimed to prevent clinical worsening among ambulatory
 COVID-19 patients with mild and moderate symptoms [16]. Such patients do not require spe-
 cialized inpatient care, and can therefore be followed in outpatient units or at home.
 Participating in a clinical trial often requires extensive follow-up beyond the disease itself,
 which may be experienced differently depending on whether participants are followed-up at
 home or in a healthcare facility. Their experience may consequently negatively affect their
 well-being and ultimately impact the implementation and outcomes of the trial. Conducting
 therapeutic trial on COVID-19 among mildly symptomatic patients may add further particu-
 larities to their trial experience, including if they are followed-up at home. They may not feel
 sick, which may reduce their compliance to treatment and research procedures; they may feel
 constrained in their daily routine by the strict requirements of research procedures; or they
 may fear the indirect disclosure of their COVID-19 disease to their entourage/neighbors when
 being visited by the medical team. There is scarce literature exploring the experiences and
 points of view of patients followed-up once they are enrolled in a therapeutic clinical trial for
 an emerging infectious disease. Only one qualitative study was found, which described experi-
 ences and challenges in participating in a hospital-based COVID-19 trial among patients with
 severe symptoms in Austria [17]. Outside of the infectious disease field, some studies assessed
 the implementation of home-care strategies for diverse indications including chronic 
<section> obstructive pulmonary disease [18], chemotherapy for cancer [19], and care following knee
 hip replacement [20]. However, no literature exploring the experiences and points of view of
 patients with mild symptoms participating in a clinical trial for an emerging infectious disease
 was found, whether followed-up at home or in a hospital, including in the African context.
 We sought to explore the acceptability and feasibility of home-based and hospital-based fol-
 low-up among patients with mild to moderate symptoms enrolled in a COVID-19 clinical trial
 in Burkina Faso and Guinea.
 
<section> Materials and methods
 
<section> Study setting: The ANTICOV ANRS COV33 Coverage-Africa
 
<section> This research was conducted as part of the ANTICOV ANRS COV33 Coverage-Africa (Clini-
 calTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04920838), a clinical trial, sponsored by ANRS-MIE and nested
 in the 01-COV ANTICOV platform trial, that aimed at evaluating the efficacy of repurposed
 drugs to prevent clinical worsening among COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symp-
 toms. The trial was implemented in the West-African urban contexts of Conakry (Guinea,
 Apr 2021–30 Dec 2021), Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso, 29 July 2021–21
 Nov 2022). This randomized clinical trial tested several treatments, including inhaled and oral
 drugs (in tablet form). Patients eligible for trial enrolment were at an early stage of their disease
 (less than 7 days of symptoms), had symptomatic but non-severe disease, i.e. with peripheral
 oxygen saturation equal of above 94% as measured by pulse oximetry, and were 40 years of age
 or older, or 18 years of age or older with comorbidity including obesity, treated hypertension
 or treated diabetes mellitus.
 Recommendations for COVID-19 management have differed between countries. In Bur-
 kina Faso, individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had mild to moderate symp-
 toms have been asked to stay at home: they can either be visited at home by mobile teams, or
 be followed-up in outpatient settings (i.e. going back and forth to a nearby health facility for
 their follow-up). Hospitalization has been restricted to patients with more severe symptoms
 at risk of clinical worsening. In Guinea, all patients (both symptomatic and asymptomatic)
 have been hospitalized in dedicated treatment centers; patients were discharged home when
 they tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
 Trial procedures regarding patient enrolment and follow-up were defined in line with these
 national COVID-19 management recommendations prevailing during the study period. Trial
 participants were followed-up for 28 days. Clinical follow-up included: 1) face-to-face assess-
 ments (at inclusion and on days 7, 14 and 21), either in a hospital, at home or in a local outpa-
 tient clinic; and 2) daily follow-up phone calls for three weeks except at days 7, 14 and 21, with
 a final end-of-study phone call on day 28; patients could contact the trial medical team when-
 ever they needed to.
 
<section> Study design and participants
 
<section> As part of the trial, we conducted a mixed-methods sub-study following a convergent parallel
 design, aiming at assessing the acceptability and feasibility of trial implementation (thereafter
 called the ‘Accept study’), from the point of view of different stakeholders. The present paper
 focuses on patient perspectives regarding follow-up in the trial, combining quantitative and
 qualitative data collected from the first enrolment in April 2021 to the end of February 2022.
 The quantitative component aimed at measuring, in an exhaustive and standardised way, the
 level of patients’ satisfaction and agreement regarding specific statements, and facilitating
 comparisons between the different follow-up models and between countries. The qualitative
 component aimed at exploring in depth participants’ individual experiences, views, and 
<section> feelings about these modalities of follow-up. Combining both quantitative and qualitative data
 aimed at providing a comprehensive assessment of the acceptability and feasibility of the dif-
 ferent modalities of follow-up from patients’ perspectives. The ‘Accept study’ was introduced
 to all trial patients, using an information sheet presented by the investigator during trial enrol-
 ment; those who agreed to participate in the sub-study signed a consent form. All consenting
 participants were invited to respond to a structured questionnaire. A sub-sample of partici-
 pants was also invited to consent to individual in-depth interviews. We purposively selected
 these patients to maximize heterogeneity in their profiles and experiences within the trial [21],
 mainly according to the following criteria: gender; age; schooling level; follow-up setting
 (home or hospital); and treatment administration method (inhalation or oral tablets).
 
<section> Conceptual framework
 
<section> We assessed participants’ experiences and views about the acceptability of the different follow-
 up models, referring to their satisfaction and subjective assessment of the appropriateness of
 these models; this evaluation was based on both cognitive and emotional responses. To do so,
 we used Sekhon’s Theoretical Framework of Acceptability [22], which includes seven domains
 such as the affective attitude (feeling) towards the intervention–in this case, the follow-up
 model–, the perceived burden for participating in the intervention, and the perceived effective-
 ness of the intervention. In addition, we investigated one specific aspect of the concept of feasi-
 bility [23], that is participants’ views about the contextual conditions that made a follow-up
 model possible for them or not. During data analysis and interpretation, we used the Socio-
 ecological Model [24], to make sense of our results according to the following levels: individual
 (i.e. participant’s experience or views concerning him/herself only); familial and inter-rela-
 tional (i.e. relative to the participant’s family members or entourage/neighbors); healthcare
 (e.g. relating to aspects concerning healthcare providers’ work); national (i.e. regarding
 national policies or recommendations). Finally, participants’ narratives were analyzed in the
 light of the sociocultural context in which they live, including the fact that West African socie-
 ties are generally characterized by a culture of interdependence among family/community
 members [25, 26], as opposed to individualism.
 
<section> Data collection
 
<section> Data for the Accept study were collected by phone (mainly to avoid the risk of COVID-19
 transmission) by interviewers who were independent from the trial medical team, and who
 received extensive training on the objectives of the study and data-collection tools.
 For the quantitative component, a 30-minute questionnaire was administered to patients
 days (D8) after their inclusion in the trial. The questions addressed the following: socio-demo-
 graphic information, perceptions regarding COVID-19, circumstances of the COVID-19 diag-
 nosis, lived experience and satisfaction with follow-up within the trial, contacts with the
 medical team, treatment experience, perceptions of clinical trials, mental health, and contact
 with family and entourage. Satisfaction of a specific follow-up model was assessed only among
 those who reported having experienced that said model. Satisfaction questions were phrased
 statements, with which participants could agree or not, using a five points ordinal Likert scale.
 Interviewers entered responses directly on a tablet dedicated to the study, using the Research
 Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software.
 For the qualitative component, two semi-structured individual interviews were conducted
 for each selected participant: 4 days (D4), and between 14 and 21 days (D14-21) after the trial
 enrolment. This two-step process aimed at preventing possible fatigue associated with a long
 interview over the phone (vs in person). D4 interviews lasted an average of 35 minutes, and 
<section> D14-21, 38 minutes. The interview guide explored at D4: experience of COVID-19 disease;
 beliefs regarding COVID-19; experience of taking part in the clinical trial; at D14-21: experi-
 ence and points of view of the different types of follow-up; and consequences of the trial partic-
 ipation on their life. Data were audio recorded.
 Study tools were designed in French and, when necessary, questions were translated into
 local languages and/or adapted to local culture to maximize participants’ understanding [27].
 In particular, key words and expressions were pre-translated into the main local languages to
 ensure maximum standardization in data collection. Interviews were conducted in French
 (n = 21) or in a local language (Guinean local languages: Soussou n = 1, Pular n = 1; Burkina
 
<section> Faso local language: Dioula n = 1), following participant’s preference, and were thereafter tran-
 scribed into French. The quotes presented in this paper were translated into English.
 
<section> Data analysis
 
<section> We analyzed participants’ experiences and perceptions of being followed-up face-to-face and
 on the phone, while they were based at home or hospitalized. We did not investigate their
 experiences and views of being followed-up in outpatient settings as this modality was not part
 of the original trial implementation plan.
 For the quantitative component, we performed descriptive analyses of Likert scale questions
 stratified by country and excluding missing values, using R software version 4.1.0.
 For the qualitative component, we performed a classical thematic analysis [28], consisting
 of the following steps: 1) a codebook was developed, based on the themes of the interview
 guides as well as on the key elements relating to acceptability and feasibility of home, facility-
 based, and telephone follow-up modalities; 2) all transcripts were read, and then deductively
 coded using the MAXQDA qualitative data analysis management software (version 2022); 3)
 recurring sub-themes were identified and summarized.
 Both quantitative and qualitative findings were then integrated for joint analysis and triangula-
 tion of all results. Our mixed-methods analysis aimed at revealing underlying meanings of partici-
 pants’ views and experiences, in context. To do so, we performed framework analysis, a systematic
 thematic analysis method which consists of managing and organizing results into a matrix, facili-
 tating the identification of patterns (tendencies) in the data [21, 29, 30]. We conducted 3 phases
 results classification: first within a three-dimensional matrix, comprising the acceptability and fea-
 sibility dimensions [22, 23], for each follow-up modality (home, hospital, telephone), and each
 country (S1 Table); then distinguishing between cognitive and emotional responses [22], i.e. pri-
 marily based on reason or emotions; finally according to the levels of the Socio-Ecological Model
 [24]. Overall, we interpreted the results taking into account the sociocultural contexts of Burkina
 Faso and Guinea. Results and interpretations were validated by the co-researchers in Burkina Faso
 and Guinea, acting as “cultural brokers” (i.e providing validation of cultural meanings) [31].
 
<section> Ethics
 
<section> The Coverage-Africa study was approved by the National Ethics Committee for Health
 Research in Burkina Faso (No2021-02-047) and the National Ethics Committee for Health
 Research of the Republic of Guinea (No043/CNERS/21).
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Description of study participants
 
<section> As of February 28, 2022, of 548 persons eligible for inclusion in Burkina Faso and Guinea,
 were enrolled in the trial, of whom 334 consented to participate in the Accept study (Fig 1).

<section> Among them, 220 completed the questionnaire (182 in Burkina Faso and 38 in Guinea) (see
 description in Table 1); and 24 patients were also interviewed (16 in Burkina Faso and 8 in
 Guinea) (see characteristics in Table 2).
 All participants responding to the questionnaire in Burkina Faso were based at home from
 trial enrolment; 2 of them were subsequently hospitalized before D8 because of symptoms
 worsening; at D8, 114 reported having had at least one follow-up visit at home since enrol-
 ment. In Guinea, all participants were hospitalized in a ‘COVID-19 treatment center’ at trial
 enrolment; at D8, 11 were back home among which 4 reported having received at least one fol-
 low-up visit at home (Table 1). As per the participants who were selected for the interviews,
 were based at home for the entire duration of their trial participation in Burkina Faso. In
 Guinea, all were hospitalized for at least one week and 7/8 had returned home before D14. In
 addition, 11 participants in Burkina Faso and 5 in Guinea had at least one home-based visit
 before D14-D21 (Table 2).
 
<section> Overall acceptability and feasibility of follow-up models
 
<section> More than 90% of participants reported being “completely satisfied” or “satisfied” overall with
 the different follow-up models implemented during the trial, either at home or in the hospital,
 and through complementary phone calls (Fig 2). Participants’ satisfaction was however
 nuanced in the qualitative interviews as well as with specific quantitative statements.
 
<section> Acceptability and feasibility of home-based follow-up
 
<section> Health considerations. Participants from both countries generally expressed the view
 that home was a suitable environment for being followed-up, if one has no or mild symptoms,
 i.e. that “the person’s physical condition [. does not require 24-hour supervision” (Burkina
 Faso, woman, 65 y.o.), and is not worried about a worsening health condition. This positive
 opinion was supported by–and even conditional on–the reassurance that they were also fol-
 lowed-up by phone during the days without home visits, and that they could call the medical
 team at any time in case of health concerns. No participant reported having difficulties with
 taking the treatment at home, either by inhalation or orally. Only a few respondents (12%)
 were worried about not being able to see a healthcare professional every day during their
 home follow-up (Fig 2); for example, in his interview, one participant from Burkina Faso was
 convinced that his level of illness would have required hospitalization and close monitoring.

 me, so that I could really know that [. there were people who could help me at any time,
 
<section> but that was not the case.” (Burkina Faso, man, 44 y.o.)
 
<section> Concerns related to the entourage. The large majority of participants (92%) were afraid
 of transmitting COVID-19 to their family (Fig 2), and many of those who participated in the
 qualitative interviews stated they appreciated the advice given by healthcare providers on how
 to avoid contamination of family members and neighbors.
 Moreover, about 25% of participants in Burkina Faso and 45% in Guinea reported being
 concerned that their neighbors would know they were sick from COVID-19 when followed
 home (Fig 2): in the qualitative interviews, participants explained that home visits by medical
 teams usually trigger curiosity from neighbors–even gossip or indiscretions–, especially when
 living in a shared compound.

 monitoring, that’s why [the caregivers] came to visit me." (Guinea, man, 45 y.o.)
 
<section> Comfort and practicality. Participants appreciated being at home while being sick from
 Covid-19 (Fig 2); in the interviews, they reported that they felt more at ease being in their own
 personal environment and it allowed them to do their household chores. Some women
 explained that staying at home while they had COVID-19 allowed them to take care of their
 children–and thus have peace of mind.

 explained in the interviews, they could indeed avoid the burden of going to the hospital (i.e.

<section> travel time; expenses for fuel) and the constraints and inconveniences of being in the hospital
 (e.g. completing all the administrative procedures; waiting time).
 
<section> "I prefer [that the medical follow-up team comes to my home] because it is less effort for me,
 with the traffic in Conakry, there you come and find me at home, you do your work and
 
<section> leave”. (Guinea, woman, 71 y.o.)
 
<section> In both countries, all participants felt comfortable having the medical team in their home,
 even if two persons (one in Burkina Faso, one in Guinea) reported that it was not easy to find
 private space for the consultation (Fig 2).
 
<section> Continuity of care. For participants from Guinea who were initially hospitalized, sus-
 tained follow-up at home after hospital discharge was seen as a continuity of care. In both
 countries, participants expressed that home visits were an indication that healthcare workers
 were serious and took care of their patients. Some said home visits made them feel important, 
<section> as it is unusual to have a visit from a doctor “if you are not a boss or a businessman” (Guinea,
 man, 64 y.o.). Home visits by the medical team were also seen by some as a novelty, an excep-
 tional innovation that deserves to be encouraged.
 
<section> "Following a patient in a hospital, [. declaring him cured and coming to visit him at home,
 asking about [his] reality, I think that this is an exceptional professionalism, it is an innova-
 tion in health that must be encouraged. [. it shows the professionalism of the medical team
 because we are the focus of their interest”. (Guinea, man, 64 y.o.,)
 
<section> Acceptability and feasibility of hospital-based follow-up
 
<section> Health considerations. In Burkina Faso, participants shared that if they had experienced
 more severe symptoms, they would have been in favor of being followed-up as inpatients. In
 Guinea, several participants stated they appreciated having been hospitalized and followed in
 treatment center during the infectious phase of their disease. In both countries, participants
 expressed a sense of reassurance that, in a hospital, there would be increased monitoring and
 quicker intervention by health professionals if their health deteriorated; in the questionnaires,
 all the Guinean participants (100%) declared that seeing health care professionals every day
 was reassuring.
 
<section> "[. if it’s necessary and [the doctor] feels that my condition requires internment [hospitali-
 zation], there’s no reason for me to refuse. In my case, that was not the case." (Burkina Faso,
 
<section> man, 68 y.o.)
 
<section> “I think the best thing for me is to stay in the hospital until the test is negative. Because noth-
 ing reassures me about those who are followed at home.” (Guinea, man, 45 y.o)
 However, 50% of participants from Guinea agreed that it was difficult to be hospitalized for
 COVID-19 while they were not having severe symptoms. As explained in the individual inter-
 views, some participants perceived that their health condition did not require hospitalization.
 
<section> “I’m here, I don’t suffer from anything, nothing hurts me, I’m only here to waste time.”
 
<section> (Guinea, woman, 32 y.o.)
 
<section> Concerns related to the entourage. In the interviews, hospitalization was often perceived
 as a good strategy to prevent contamination of other family members; this was also reported
 by 37/38 of questionnaire respondents in Guinea (Fig 2). Interviews also suggested that, in the
 Guinean context, patients perceived hospitalization as advantageous because the neighbor-
 hood would not know that they had COVID-19; half of the respondents to the questionnaire
 agreed with this statement (Fig 2).
 
<section> “[. no one around me knows that I am ill with COVID-19 and hospitalized at the treat-
 ment center, for them I have traveled, I am in Kankan.” (Guinea, woman, 32 y.o.)
 Some participants were however unhappy with hospitalization. Not being able to get out
 from the facility was seen as a barrier to managing family life and providing basic care for their
 children, leading to feelings of worry and frustration. Mandatory hospitalization as in Guinea
 was even experienced by some participants as being in a prison from where they wanted to
 leave as rapidly as possible. In addition, the ban on visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic 
<section> led hospitalized patients to feel anxious, deprived from customary visits by at least one family
 member for moral support and care.
 
<section> "I had no choice [to be followed in a hospital]. [. my father [. told me to be brave until
 the day I was released. But this bothers me, as I’m the head of the family. I left my child [who
 is] ill, I had to borrow money to give to my mother so that she could send my child to a hospi-
 tal. Every morning I have to go out to get food for my children, otherwise they can’t have food.
 I’m here, I don’t suffer from anything, nothing hurts me, I’m here only to waste time [. for
 nothing. [. I am really upset. [. My mother called me [to tell me] that my child is lying
 sick, that he even had a seizure. I explained this to the doctor who [. told me to wait. I
 waited until the evening, [and] I escaped." (Guinea, woman, 32 y.o.)
 “I’m losing my time [. it’s not a place for leisure so I want to run away and get out.”
 
<section> (Guinea, man, 64 y.o.)
 
<section> Hospital environment considerations. While some patients were totally satisfied with
 hospitalization–to the point of making one of them "forget the disease" (Guinea, man, 64 y.o.),
 other patients shared difficult experiences of being in dirty and/or overcrowded rooms.
 
<section> "I told Dr [X] that I can’t live in this, I can’t leave my home, come, and you put me in this. If
 that’s it, I would rather stay at home and confine myself there. At home, I can’t say I have lux-
 ury, but still, I know it’s clean. If I’m sick, I can’t come and live where it’s dirty. (Guinea,
 
<section> woman, 55 y.o.)
 
<section> In Burkina Faso, some participants mentioned that hospital settings were perceived as
 poorly organized, providing inadequate quality of care at the beginning of the pandemic, and
 were thus psychologically disruptive to COVID-19 patients (and their families). One partici-
 pant even feared that hospitalization would equate to death.
 
<section> "[. the information and images that we saw at the beginning [of the pandemic] of COVID
 cases that were interned [i.e. hospitalized], are not very positive. When we see that, we don’t
 expect to have all the care. So I wouldn’t want to be [hospitalized] for the study. Because we
 get the impression that the care is not correct." (Burkina Faso, woman, 40 y.o.)
 "All of those I knew who were hospitalized, none of them survived. They all passed away. In
 my opinion they kill them on purpose. It looks like the doctors are giving these patients injec-
 tions to kill them. It is for this reason that I do not like to go to the hospital." (Burkina Faso,
 
<section> woman, 43 y.o.)
 
<section> Acceptability and feasibility of phone follow-up
 
<section> Health considerations. In both the interviews and in the questionnaire (Fig 2), phone
 calls were mainly perceived as reassuring, as participants would be quickly assisted in case of
 health deterioration, especially for patients followed at home. Participants underlined the
 importance of combining telephone calls with face-to-face assessments so that the medical
 team could assess their actual health status. Only a few people (<4%) found it difficult to talk
 about their illness over the phone (Fig 2).
 
<section> [The phone calls] are always a relief, it makes me feel better, it shows that I’m being well fol-
 
<section> lowed.” (Burkina Faso, man, 46 y.o.) 
<section> "[. through phone calls they can’t see my blood pressure and so, if they come to my house,
 they can see my condition concretely." (Guinea, man, 45 y.o.)
 
<section> Practicality. The majority of participants (>99% in Burkina Faso and 76% in Guinea)
 reported that it was easy to find a private space to discuss on the phone with the trial medical
 team. Yet, in Guinea, some interview respondents found it difficult especially when they were
 hospitalized in a shared room, or in the presence of family members or visitors at the time of
 the calls. Additionally, some spoke of missed calls, unstable telephone network, unavailability
 of healthcare team members to answer their calls, and calls being somewhat disruptive.
 
<section> "Well, that’s fine. Except that when you’re a bit busy and they call, you find that it’s a bit of
 trick [disturbing]. Otherwise, when you’re sitting down, you have nothing to do, and then
 they call you, [. it is not a problem." (Burkina Faso, woman, 39 y.o.)
 
<section> Participants perceived that phone follow-up also presented several advantages for the medi-
 cal team; it saved travel time especially when workload was too heavy and in the urban context
 of Conakry where traffic jams are a daily concern.
 
<section> [. we are in a city where traffic jams are legendary and the doctor also has his time, but,
 we can use this other channel to treat, maybe we will not only save time but, they will also con-
 sult many more patients than by [home visit]. I think it’s an excellent thing". (Guinea, man,
 
<section> 64 y.o.)
 
<section> Continuity of care. In the interviews, many participants considered phone calls as a way
 to ensure continuity of care with face-to-face assessments. Phone follow-up meant that health-
 care providers cared about their health and well-being. For some participants, telephone fol-
 low-up was perceived as a modern model of care, a technological evolution that can be
 considered.
 
<section> « [. it is the health professionals [. who contributed to having good results by taking the
 parameters, by giving me the medication. So if the same people after my recovery continue to
 call me, [. I consider that I am not abandoned to myself. I am followed by professionals
 and I know that my health is their concern.” (Guinea, man, 64 y.o.)
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> The COVID-19 pandemic has led to rapid, alternative, innovative, and sometimes drastic deci-
 sions in terms of patient management and follow-up, in response to national priorities and
 strategies for epidemic control. It has also led to considering alternative models for implement-
 ing clinical trials, including home-based and hybrid trials, that can include home visits and
 remote follow-up through the use of mobile technologies [32]. Our findings inform on the
 acceptability and feasibility of home-based and hospital-based follow-up among pauci-symp-
 tomatic COVID-19 patients, in the context of a COVID-19 clinical trial in sub-Saharan Africa.
 In our study, participants from Burkina Faso and Guinea were satisfied overall with the fol-
 low-up implemented in the Coverage-Africa trial–whether they were seen by the trial medical
 team at home or during hospitalization. They nevertheless raised some issues, mainly relating
 to the place where they experienced their illness; however, they did not talk much about the
 follow-up as such, the two being intertwined in their reality. Our analysis showed that factors
 influencing their views and experiences of the appropriateness of follow-up were sometimes

<section> socio-ecological model. Coverage-Africa trial. 2021–2022.
 
<section> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0001545.g003
 
<section> cognitive/rational in nature, but more importantly, emotion-related, with recurrent reference
 to fears/worries or reassurance (Fig 3). Also, participants’ concerns pertained to individual,
 familial/inter-relational, healthcare and national level factors. Finally, participants’ views were
 modulated by the sociocultural context in which they live as well as by the COVID-19 national
 recommendations.
 
<section> Cognitive responses
 
<section> Convenience/practicality was a key individual-level factor associated with participants’ percep-
 tion of acceptability and feasibility of follow-up. Patients followed-up at home appreciated
 avoiding the burden of going to the hospital (i.e. travel time; expenses of fuel), as reported in
 study conducted in the UK [18]. Patients also shared their satisfaction with being in their own
 environment, which they perceived as more comfortable compared to the hospital, as also
 reported for other health conditions in the UK, South Korea and Australia [18–20].
 As per factors having an incidence on the organization of healthcare, participants followed
 at home did not report specific challenges with the feasibility of finding a private room/space
 for face-to-face assessments and phone follow-ups. However, hospitalized patients in a shared
 room reported problems finding privacy for phone follow-ups. Technical difficulties such as
 missed calls or unstable network were among the most common challenges of phone follow-
 up, as already well-evidenced in the field of digital health [33]. But participants also acknowl-
 edged that phone follow-ups allowed the medical team to avoid travel and traffic congestion,
 thereby reducing their burden–i.e. the perceived effort–related to patient follow-up. In addi-
 tion, in Guinea, home-based follow-up after hospitalization was perceived as continuity of
 care, which is consistent with reports from trial participants in the UK [18].
 
<section> Emotional responses
 
<section> Participants’ perception of the severity of their COVID-19 symptoms emerged as the most
 important criterion for judging the appropriateness of the follow-up models in the context of 
<section> their participation in the Coverage-Africa trial. Indeed, patients who perceived their symptoms
 as mild found it appropriate to be followed at home, as long as they were reassured through the
 phone follow-up and the possibility to contact the medical team by telephone if necessary. In
 contrast, the hospital setting was considered more reassuring–and therefore more acceptable–
 for patients with moderate to severe symptoms, in that they could benefit from more rapid
 assessment and care if their health deteriorated. This need for reassurance stems from the fear
 of physical and psychological suffering and the fear of dying, which are related to the need for
 safety–which is recognized as a basic human need according to Maslow’s hierarchy [34].
 Several participants alluded to both family support and family commitments as key drivers of
 the acceptability of different follow-up models. Among hospitalized participants, the inability to
 have a family member at their bedside was a source of distress, as also showed in a study con-
 ducted in Austria among hospitalized patients with severe symptoms [17]. Social support is
 indeed important in times of hardship, especially in the case of emerging epidemics [35, 36], as
 well as in the West African collectivist context of strong solidarity [37]. Hospitalized mothers also
 expressed worries and stress about being unable to manage their household and leaving their
 young children without care. Correspondingly, mothers who were followed-up at home appreci-
 ated being able to look after the well-being of their family. In settings where there are no or lim-
 ited social safety nets, parents–and especially mothers–must rely on their own means to take on
 their daily lives and, in some cases, to ensure their survival and that of their children [25].
 As per inter-relational factors, the acceptability of home-based follow-up was influenced, for
 some participants by the fear of stigmatization–particularly among those living in conditions
 where they could easily be observed by the neighborhood (e.g. shared compound). Although
 stigma and ostracism appear to be an adaptive response to allow uninfected individuals to avoid
 contracting the COVID-19 disease [38, 39], this social exclusion can cause shame and affect the
 psychological well-being of those who experience it [40, 41], especially in the West African col-
 lectivist context where social ties are central [42–45]. In Guinea, our study carried out with
 community members showed that some people prefer to avoid disclosing that they have been
 infected in order to prevent any possible stigma [37]. Hospitalization may be a better option for
 those patients who wish to remain discreet about their SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to
 home follow-up. Nevertheless, others participants, especially in Burkina Faso, appreciated that
 the trial medical team came to their homes and took into account their physical living environ-
 ment by giving advice on how to prevent contamination of relatives and neighbors. Overall, our
 findings suggest that the individual’s immediate social environment (e.g. shared vs individual
 compound) should be part of the considerations for successful health interventions.
 Finally, a national level factor emerged from the narratives in Guinea, where hospitalization
 of all COVID+ individuals in an “epidemiological treatment center” was mandatory. In this
 context, some participants experienced this obligation as imprisonment; cases of “escape”
 from these treatment centers were reported. We hypothesize that such reactions stem, among
 other things, from the social context of mistrust of the Guinean government and health
 authorities, as reported by community members in Conakry [37]. These findings suggest that
 policies involving mandatory hospitalization of COVID-19 patients might have led, and could
 lead to in the future if replicated, some people to avoid being tested for COVID-19, thus pre-
 venting them from receiving appropriate care and risking contaminating their family/entou-
 rage, which could be counterproductive in terms of epidemic control.
 
<section> Strengths and limitations of the study
 
<section> To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the acceptability and feasibility, from the
 perspective of West African participants, of different follow-up models for patients with mild 
<section> to moderate infectious disease in the context of their participation in a clinical trial. This study
 used a mixed-methods design that included, among others, implementation research and
 social science concepts and research tools. The qualitative sample was characterized by a selec-
 tion of participants with diversified profiles in terms of age, sex and level of schooling, which
 allowed us to elicit a variety of points of view. The findings showed a convergence between
 qualitative and quantitative data, thus contributing to the validity of our results. The fact that
 the study was conducted in two West African countries allowed us to explore two different
 local contexts and national policies and sociocultural specificities. Our multidisciplinary team
 of social science researchers, public health experts, medical doctors (including infectious dis-
 eases specialists) and epidemiologists from Burkina Faso, Guinea and France, contributed to
 enhancing the richness of data collected and to validating the scientific and sociocultural inter-
 pretations of the data. Moreover, we used an in-depth analysis methodology, which was based
 on a comprehensive conceptual framework, allowing for a thorough investigation of the issues
 at stake.
 Yet, we acknowledge some limitations regarding this study. We included only individuals
 who already consented to participate in the trial, i.e. de facto had accepted the models of fol-
 low-up proposed in the trial (aligned to that of the country). In Guinea, national recommenda-
 tions at the time of the trial—i.e. all individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 had to be
 hospitalized—may have caused some people to avoid getting tested [37]: this could potentially
 affect the profile of the patients enrolled in the trial if the latter had different characteristics
 compared to the patients included. Also, one of the documented reasons for refusal to partici-
 pate in the Coverage-Africa trial was the fear of a high number of follow-up visits and calls;
 therefore, the fact that participants in the ‘Accept study’ had already agreed to take part in the
 trial and therefore to these follow-up conditions, suggests a possible selection bias leading to
 higher acceptability. Many participants had a “privileged” profile, i.e. living in a home with a
 private yard or having a relatively high level of education, which may explain why few of them
 reported fearing stigmatization; this potential socioeconomic bias related to participant selec-
 tion may also have prevented the identification of structural barriers regarding home and
 phone-based follow-up, such as access to individual rooms. Several trial participants who con-
 sented to participate in the ‘Accept’ sub-study did not ultimately complete the questionnaire.
 This was mainly due to the fact that there was no available research assistant in Burkina Faso
 for some time; also some participants did not answer the phone calls from interviewers. How-
 ever, as these non-respondents did not differ from the other participants in terms of sex and
 age, we believe there is a low risk of selection bias. In addition, although the number of partici-
 pants included in Burkina Faso is relatively high, it is quite small in Guinea due to the epi-
 demic curve (i.e. low number of confirmed cases at the time of the study), which limits the
 estimation of observations regarding the quantitative component in this country. Moreover,
 the questionnaire was drafted in a very short period of time, in the context of an epidemic
 emergency where the research protocol and tools had to be quickly submitted for ethical
 approval; some questions may have been too simplistic. This may explain the lack of diversity
 and contrast in some responses, and thus consequently that we were unable to perform statisti-
 cal tests to determine whether certain socio-demographic factors were associated with partici-
 pants’ perceptions. As stated above, we have not assessed the experiences of being followed-up
 in outpatient settings in Burkina Faso; this modality would benefit from evaluation to inform
 future clinical trials. Also, we have used Sekhon’s Theoretical Framework of Acceptability only
 at the analysis phase and not specifically for the development of the questionnaire and the
 interview guide: this may explain why we did not find results for all constructs of acceptability
 (as shown in the S1 Table). Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected by phone; this
 may have impaired the rapport between the interviewers and the interviewees thus creating 
<section> environment less conducive to the free expression of experiences and feelings [46]. Partici-
 pants may have minimized their experiences/points of view about their participation in the
 trial because of social desirability towards the interviewer; however, the interviewers were
 independent of the medical team so we are confident that this prevarication bias was limited.
 In addition, patients mostly reported views about the place where they were followed-up rather
 than their views about the follow-up by healthcare professionals per se; this may have led to
 some confusion, especially in Guinea where all patients were hospitalized at the onset of their
 infection, as interactions with healthcare professionals who were not directly involved in the
 trial might have influenced their perspectives and experiences of the trial follow-up. Finally,
 the study was conducted in two urban settings: results might not be fully applicable to West-
 African rural settings.
 
<section> Conclusions
 
<section> The COVID-19 pandemic "catalyzed" the implementation of out-of-hospital follow-up models
 for clinical trials, such as home and telephone follow-ups. Our study shows that home follow-
 up in the context of a clinical trial was acceptable for mildly ill West-African patients, mainly
 provided that (i) they did not perceive their illness as too severe, (ii) it was combined with tele-
 medicine, and (iii) risk of stigma could be avoided. The implementation of strategies to
 decrease the risk and/or fear of stigma and help communities to better deal with emerging
 infectious diseases is key to ensure good follow-up conditions for patients and trial partici-
 pants. Furthermore, home follow-up was generally preferred, especially by mothers who could
 continue to care for their children. Our results also highlight the importance of emotions in
 the acceptability of trial follow-up models and suggest that emotion-based considerations
 should be included when assessing the feasibility and planning the implementation of a trial,
 or developing any public health strategy. Furthermore, not taking into account emotional
 imperatives may have an incidence on patients’ mental health–by generating worries, stress,
 distress, anxiety, shame, etc.–which is counterproductive in the context of healthcare, and
 even deleterious. The results of this study highlighted the importance the importance to con-
 duct formative research on patients’ perspectives, concerns and needs according to their living
 contexts, when planning clinical trials, especially in the context of an epidemic emergency.
 Also, the recommendations of this study will inform health policy makers on the acceptability
 and feasibility of models for following patients who are not severely ill, as well as researchers
 for the design of clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments.
