<section> Abstract
 
<section> This study aimed to investigate the effect of role-playing and lecture on improving the atti-
 tudes of the Khorramabad suburban population toward the human immunodeficiency virus
 (HIV). In 2019, 270 people aged 18 and above participated in a randomized controlled trial
 in Khorramabad, Iran. Individuals were randomly assigned to one of three groups: role-play-
 ing, lecture, or control. To collect data before and after the intervention, we used a standard
 HIV knowledge and attitude questionnaire. Before the educational intervention, three mar-
 ginalized groups’ attitudes toward HIV were stigmatized. After the intervention, the attitudes
 of both the role-playing and lecture groups improved significantly relative to the control
 group (P<0.0001); there was no significant difference between the two methods (P>0.05).
 The correlation between attitude and knowledge scores was positive (P<0.0001). This study
 demonstrates that education is a fundamental pillar of improving attitudes toward people liv-
 ing with HIV (PLHIV) and can reduce stigma against them, thereby increasing their desire
 disclose their condition and seek medical care.

<section> Introduction
 
<section> The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that by 2019, 38 million people would be
 infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), including 1.7 million new cases and
 690,000 deaths due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). According to a report
 published by the Iranian Ministry of Health, there were 41494 people infected with HIV and
 19164 deaths as of the end of 2019 [1]. In addition, approximately 1293 cases were reported
 the Iranian province of Lorestan. According to a 2017 study conducted in this province’s 
<section> single-blinded randomized, controlled educational
 trial using role-playing and lecturing", in addition to
 receiving the Ethical code (IR.MUI.RESEARCH.
 
<section> REC.1398.482) and the RCT code
 (IRCT20190807044467N1), we had to obtain an
 executive permission from the Centers for Disease
 Control (CDC), the Ministry of Health (MOH). In the
 received permission, it is officially stated that we
 are not allowed to publish individual data. It is also
 mentioned that if we want to publish information,
 we should coordinate with CDC. It should be noted
 that the data set is now kept confidential by the
 project manager and the corresponding author of
 the article, Dr. Maryam Nasirian. But to receive
 data, permission must be obtained from the Dr.
 Hengameh Namdari (namdarih@gmail.com), the
 manager of Department of AIDS and Sexually
 Transmitted Infections, CDC, MOH. We confirm
 that any researcher can obtain the data set in the
 same way that we have obtained it.

<section> capital, Khorramabad, the number of HIV-positive individuals was estimated to be 2,456 [2],
 and some of these individuals were observed to reside in three marginalized regions surround-
 ing Khorramabad; however, no accurate data regarding the number of patients in these areas
 exist.
 HIV infection is a threat to marginalized populations. High population density, lack of
 adaptability and coexistence between different cultures, increasing unemployment and low
 income, lack of adequate welfare and educational facilities, relatively low level of public health,
 insufficient literacy, and lack of knowledge about HIV, as well as negative attitudes toward
 patients with HIV, provide a foundation for the spread of high-risk behaviors and the preva-
 lence of HIV in these populations [3–5]. Consequently, planning for HIV prevention and con-
 trol in this vulnerable population appears necessary.
 HIV/AIDS remains a serious problem in the global health system due to its diverse modes
 of transmission, high mortality rate, high cost of treatment, and social issues such as stigma
 and discrimination. To this end, HIV prevention methods remain one of the WHO’s primary
 concerns. However, it is essential to consider that HIV infection affects patients’ mental and
 social health and physical health, owing primarily to society’s negative attitude toward the dis-
 ease. Negative attitudes lead to the stigmatization of patients and, as a result, their discrimina-
 tion and social exclusion; consequently, many patients attempt to conceal their illness, even
 from their partners or medical professionals [6].
 According to statistics in Iran, approximately 15.4% of people who living with HIV
 (PLHIV) fail to visit service centers to receive care. In the Lorestan province, approximately
 71% of the total number of registered cases are active, and about 80% of active cases receive
 treatment [7]. The unwillingness of patients to disclose their disease, on the one hand, results
 in inadequate health care services and, on the other, the spread of infection among their
 acquaintances and other members of society. Due to a lack of knowledge about HIV, stigma-
 tizing attitudes exist [8]. To this end, reducing the stigmatizing attitude towards HIV patients,
 particularly vulnerable and high-risk populations, is an important method for preventing the
 spread of HIV, where only possible through HIV education and awareness [9].
 There are several HIV education strategies, but the two most prevalent and influential are
 lecture and role-playing, each of which has advantages and disadvantages [10]. The advantages
 of the lecture method are a large number of students relative to the teacher, its low cost, the
 strengthening of social relationships, and increasing the self-confidence and interest of the stu-
 dents [11]. The superior characteristics of the role-playing method are that the audience devel-
 ops an emotional connection with the performance and the role-players and watches the play’s
 development with excitement and a sense of being onstage. As a result of the method’s empha-
 sis on the senses and emotional communication, learning is enhanced and made more efficient
 [12].
 Due to the high prevalence of HIV infection in Khorramabad, particularly in the marginal-
 ized regions [13], and the lack of adequate education for people in these regions, the present
 study aimed to examine the effects of two educational methods, lecture, and role-playing, on
 reducing stigmatizing attitudes towards patients as a key factor in controlling and preventing
 the spread of HIV among the vulnerable population.
 
<section> Material and methods
 
<section> Study design, participation, and sampling
 
<section> The current study was a single-blinded, parallel, randomized, controlled educational trial
 study comprising three education groups: 1) role-playing, 2) lecture, and 3) a control group
 (Fig 1).

<section> This study aimed to examine the effects of two educational methods, lecture and role-play-
 ing, on reducing stigmatizing attitudes toward patients, a key factor in controlling and pre-
 venting the spread of HIV in the vulnerable population.
 The present study was conducted as a three-armed randomized controlled educational trial
 from May to July 2019 at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences on a marginalized population
 aged 18–49 living in three regions (a total population of 38731); Falak od Din (N = 11313),
 Masur (N = 12475), and Poshteh (N = 14943) villages in Khorramabad city. The sample size
 was calculated using the formula for multi-arm clinical trial studies and considering the differ-
 ences in mean attitude scores between the role-playing group (95.4) and the lecture group
 (98.3) based on a method described in Abedian et al. [10], a confidence level of 95%, 80% test
 power, and a 10% probability of loss during the study, equal to 110 in the control group and
 per intervention group (lecture and role-playing).
 Each region had three health centers, which were considered classes, and sampling was per-
 formed based on the population covered by each center, the share of age and gender groups,
 and the existing list of individuals on the Sib website using simple random sampling. After
 matching against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the individuals were contacted by phone
 and invited to visit the relevant centers to participate in the study. If an individual declined to
 participate or were ineligible, another person of the same age and gender would be randomly
 selected and contacted by phone. The procedure was repeated until samples were collected
 from all age and gender groups. 
<section> Inclusion criteria for this study included: age between 18 and 49, Iranian citizenship, resi-
 dence in Falak od Din, Masur, and Poshteh, elementary school education or higher, mental
 capacity to comprehend education and produce a response, absence of known psychiatric dis-
 orders or severe visual and hearing impairments, and written informed consent to participate
 in the study. They were also excluded from the study if they refused to participate or died dur-
 ing the research.
 To meet the requirement of blinding the participants, they were randomly assigned by
 region because it was impossible to blind individuals from the same region, and despite the
 intention, they were aware of which group they belonged to after speaking with other partici-
 pants. Therefore, we randomized the population of Falak od Din to participate in the role-
 playing group, the population of Poshteh to receive lectures, and the population of Masur to
 serve as a control.
 
<section> Research instruments
 
<section> We collected data using a standard questionnaire. In a study conducted by Tavakoli, the con-
 tent and face validity of the questionnaire were evaluated using a qualitative method, and
 Cronbach’s alpha for internal validity was 0.79 for the attitude section and 0.77 for the knowl-
 edge section [14]. The main section of the questionnaire consisted of 18 questions (4 items)
 about the attitude assessment. The remaining two sections contained 24 knowledge-based
 questions and five questions about demographic data.
 The stigmatizing attitude was measured on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, dis-
 agree, neutral, agree, strongly agree), with 14 negative questions scored from 1 (most positive
 attitude) to 5 (most negative attitude) and four positive questions scored in reverse order.
 Therefore, the range of scores obtained from all attitude questions was between 18 (positive
 attitude) and 90 (stigmatizing attitude), with the highest score indicating a more stigmatizing
 attitude. Consequently, participants who scored above the mean (54 points) were categorized
 as having stigmatizing attitudes toward patients.
 Yes and no answers were required for the knowledge section, with a score of 1 for each cor-
 rect response and a score of 0 for each incorrect response. The scores obtained from the total
 number of attitude questions ranged from 0 to 24, and the lowest score indicated a lack of
 knowledge.
 
<section> Data collection
 
<section> The educational material was extracted from the booklet titled "a new approach to HIV education,"
 compiled by the Department of AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases within the Ministry of
 Health and Medical Education [15]. In both educational approaches, HIV biology, epidemic condi-
 tions in the province and Iran, transmission methods, high-risk behaviors, self-preservation skills,
 and negative attitudes and misconceptions about HIV patients were covered. The educational
 intervention was conducted in two groups, "lecture" and "role-playing," and a pamphlet was
 designed and distributed to both groups. The control group received no intervention.
 The participants provided written informed consent and completed the self-administered
 knowledge and attitude questionnaire after explaining the purpose of the research and assur-
 ing them of the confidentiality of their data. Afterward, the interventions, which included
 teaching via lecture and role-playing, were performed according to the grouping, and the edu-
 cational schedule was conducted for one hour per week for one month in the marginalized
 regions’ health community centers and mosques.
 Due to the extremely high possibility of displacement and disappearance of individuals in
 marginal populations, the interval between the conclusion of educational interventions and 
<section> the reevaluation of individuals was determined to be two weeks, and the questionnaire was
 administered to all individuals in the control group and both intervention groups again.
 
<section> Data analysis
 
<section> We analyzed the data using SPSS V.23 and characterized them using the mean, standard devia-
 tion, frequency, and percentage. In addition, we analyzed the data using the independent two-
 sample t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Chi-square test at a significance level of 5%.
 Multiple analyses were used to examine the effects of group differences before the intervention,
 confounding variables, and the correlation between knowledge and attitude scores. The signif-
 icance level in all analyses was 5%.
 
<section> Ethics approval
 
<section> The Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials approved all experimental protocols with the code
 IRCT20190807044467N1. In addition, Iran National Committee for Ethics in Biomedical
 Research approved this study with an ethical code (IR.MUI.RESEARCH.REC.1398.482), and

<section> Results
 
<section> We included a total of 270 individuals (51% females) between the ages of 18 and 49 from mar-
 ginalized regions, Falak od Din (role-playing: 80), Masur (control: 110), and Poshteh (lecture:
 80). There was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0190) in the mean age of the partici-
 pants across the three groups, but there were no differences (P>0.05) in any of the other
 demographic variables. The lecture group had a significantly longer history of receiving HIV
 education than the other two groups (p<0.0001) (Table 1).
 The overall results indicated that before the intervention, the average knowledge score in
 people living in Khorramabad’s suburban areas was around 17.4 (4.4). Furthermore, before
 the intervention, the control group’s mean knowledge score was significantly lower than that
 of both the lecture and role-playing groups (p = 0.001), while there was no significant differ-
 ence between the lecture and role-playing groups (p = 0.972). After controlling for the effects
 of the age difference and history of HIV education in the groups before the intervention, the
 mean post-intervention knowledge scores were significantly different between groups, with
 the control group scoring significantly lower than the intervention groups (p<0.0001). There
 was, however, no statistically significant difference between the lecture and role-playing groups
 (p = 0.650). Despite a significant increase in knowledge scores in all three groups due to the
 intervention, the increase in the control group was significantly different from the increases
 the intervention groups (p<0.0001). Before the intervention, there was a significant correla-
 tion between attitude and knowledge scores (r = 0.425, p 0.0001), and after the intervention,
 the correlation remained significant (r = 0.484, p<0.0001) (Table 2).
 Overall, the results showed that the average score of individuals’ attitudes in marginalized
 areas of Khorramabad was approximately 44.4. This value was near the median (54), indicating
 that their attitudes toward HIV were stigmatized. Furthermore, at the start of the study,
 approximately 15.6% of all participants had stigmatizing attitudes (a score over 45). The stig-
 matizing attitude was significantly lower in the lecture group than in the control group
 (p = 0.012), but there was no significant difference in the role-playing group (p = 0.262). After

<section> Discussion

 education on improving social attitudes toward PLHIV, numerous studies [16, 8] have empha-
 sized the importance of education in reducing HIV-related stigma. The findings of the
 CHAMP study on racial and ethnic diversity in the United States highlighted the importance
 of education in reducing stigmatized attitudes toward patients [17].
 An intriguing aspect of the current study was that a significant proportion of the partici-
 pants did not receive AIDS training until the intervention. Assuming that the marginalized
 population of Khorramabad was representative of all marginalized populations in Iran and
 considering the populations’ susceptibility to high-risk behaviors and, consequently, HIV
 infection [3–5], it would appear that Iran must plan for the education of these marginalized
 populations.
 According to the results, there was a positive correlation between HIV knowledge and
 attitude, so a higher level of HIV knowledge improved attitudes toward the disease and
 patients. Therefore, it appears necessary to increase HIV knowledge as a prerequisite for
 changing societal attitudes [18]. Notably, a high level of HIV knowledge alone will not change
 societal attitudes; therefore, it is necessary to design specific educational programs to improve
 attitudes. 
<section> Despite the lack of difference between the effectiveness of role-playing and lecture in
 improving attitude in the present study, studies [20, 19] observed that role-playing has a
 greater impact on improving knowledge and attitude. Therefore, we recommend conducting
 additional research on the use of appropriate educational methods for the emotional domain
 of learning and shifting attitudes toward HIV, such as multimedia methods, scenarios, role-
 playing, plays, and group discussions [21,22].
 Not every educational method can be used to improve attitudes in marginalized popula-
 tions, as their cultural, economic, and social circumstances and lifestyles differ from those of
 the general population. For instance, studies have revealed that the general and health literacy
 levels of marginalized populations are lower than the national average [3–5]; thus, additional
 research is required to determine the most effective educational approach for these vulnerable
 populations.
 This study’s results revealed that the three groups’ attitude scores significantly differed
 before any educational intervention. According to the studies, the disparity was attributable
 the different histories of HIV education between the groups. The group that had received
 more HIV education in the past had a more positive attitude. Given that the groups did not
 differ in terms of characteristics such as education levels, this result at the onset of the study
 indicated the effect of education on improving the attitudes of individuals. However, negative
 attitudes decreased in both the lecture and role-playing groups following the educational inter-
 vention, and the effects of differences in the history of HIV training were controlled, demon-
 strating the effectiveness of education in improving attitudes in the present study.
 The results also indicated that the disparity in the overall attitude scores of the three groups
 at the outset of the study resulted from the difference in the scores of social harassment and
 social support. Multiple studies have found that HIV-positive individuals do not receive suffi-
 cient social support [23,24]. Therefore, we recommend planning to improve the social support
 for people with HIV from their families and society and educate individuals to improve their
 attitudes toward HIV patients.
 Notably, at the conclusion of the study, the negative attitude increased in the control group,
 who did not receive any training, most likely due to a coincidence where news of the sudden
 discovery of a large number of people living with HIV for unknown reasons prompted people
 to fear and distrust the health care system. The wave of concern spread throughout Iran, par-
 ticularly in rural regions and marginalized populations, for several months [25], and the news
 may have contributed to an increase in stigmatizing attitudes towards HIV in the control
 group. Negative attitudes decreased despite such conditions in the lecture and role-playing
 groups, indicating that education positively improves attitudes regardless of the
 circumstances.
 One of the study’s limitations was the possibility of different attitudes between those willing
 and unwilling to participate. To reduce contamination bias in education, we assigned three
 regions to intervention and control groups instead of participants. Nonetheless, the residents
 of these regions may interact. Due to the cultural taboo surrounding HIV in Iran, participants
 may not have answered the questions correctly, and social desirability bias existed. The interval
 between the conclusion of educational interventions and the reevaluation of individuals was
 two weeks, but a longer interval would have resulted in a more accurate assessment due to the
 high likelihood of population displacement among marginalized groups.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> Education must be a pillar of efforts to reduce stigmatizing attitudes toward HIV and its
 patients. Improving societal attitudes improves social support for HIV patients who are 
<section> eventually exposed to the disease and receive medical care, an effective step in preventing and
 controlling the disease. Given the susceptibility of marginalized populations to HIV and their
 unique living conditions, additional research should be conducted to identify effective and
 appropriate educational strategies for improving attitudes in these populations.
