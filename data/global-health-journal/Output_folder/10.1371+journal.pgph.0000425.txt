<section> Abstract
 
<section> Health systems in many low- and middle-income countries are struggling to manage type
 diabetes (T2D). Management of glycaemia via well-organized care can reduce T2D inci-
 dence, and associated morbidity and mortality. The primary aim of this study was to evalu-
 ate the effectiveness of facility plus community care interventions (integrated care),
 compared to facility only care interventions (facility care) towards improvement of T2D out-
 comes in Uganda and South Africa. A pragmatic cluster randomized trial design was used
 compare outcomes among participants with T2D and those at high risk. The trial had two
 study arms; the integrated care arm, and the facility care arm; and in Uganda only, an addi-
 tional usual care arm. Participants were enrolled at nine primary health facilities in Uganda,
 and two in South Africa. Participants were adults aged 30 to 75 years, and followed for up
 12 months. Primary outcomes were glycaemic control among participants with T2D, and
 reduction in HbA1c > = 3 mmol/mol among participants at high risk. Secondary outcomes
 were retention into care and incident T2D. Adjusted analysis revealed significantly higher
 retention into care comparing integrated care and facility care versus usual care in Uganda
 and integrated care versus facility care in South Africa. The effect was particularly high

 the facility care arm and 3.52 [2.13–5.80] for the integrated care arm. No improvement in
 glycaemic control or reduction in HbA1c was found in either country. However, considerable
 and unbalanced loss to follow-up compromised assessment of the intervention effect on
 HbA1c. Study interventions significantly improved retention into care, especially compared
 to usual care in Uganda. This highlights the need for adequate primary care for T2D and

<section> Introduction
 
<section> The global burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and associated morbidity and mortality
 continues to rise, especially in low- and middle-income counties (LMICs) [1]. The 2019 global
 burden of disease estimated that diabetes among adults would increase from an estimated
 prevalence of 8.8% in 2015, to a prevalence of 10.4% by 2040; and most of the increase would
 occur in LMICs. The same study further showed that in 2019, diabetes ranked th as the lead-
 ing cause of deaths and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost, up from th in 1990 [2].
 Global estimates also show that sustained glycemic control among patients with diabetes is
 only 50% [3]. Data from STEPS surveys conducted in 40 LMICs showed that of all patients
 with T2D in these countries, only 38% are on treatment, and 23% achieve glycemic control [4].
 Furthermore, data from the South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
 (SANHANES-1 [2011–2012]) found that among individuals with T2D, 45.4% were
 unscreened, 14.7% were screened but undiagnosed, 2.3% were diagnosed but untreated, and
 18.1% were treated but uncontrolled; suggesting that 80.5% of the population with diabetes
 had unmet need for care [5].
 To manage the disease adequately, people living with T2D do not only need timely care but
 also diabetes self-management education and ongoing diabetes self-management support [6].
 Similarly, to prevent or delay onset of T2D, people at high risk should receive preventive care,
 education and support to manage risk for T2D. There is strong evidence demonstrating that
 the absence of risk reduction interventions, approximately 5%– 10% of individuals with pre-
 diabetes progress to diabetes annually [7]. Several randomized controlled trials conducted in
 high income countries (HICs), including the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) [8], and the
 Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS) [9], also demonstrate that lifestyle/ behavioral inter-
 ventions are highly effective in preventing T2D.
 Given the increasing burden of diabetes in LMICs, and the lack of targeted prevention strat-
 egies coupled with inadequate care for T2D, there is an urgent need to identify context relevant
 interventions with the potential to work across different income settings, aimed at preventing
 progress to diabetes among individuals at high risk, as well as improving diabetes management
 outcomes among patients with diabetes.
 The ‘Self-Management Approach and Reciprocal learning for Type 2 Diabetes’
 (SMART2D) was a collaborative project implemented between January 2015 and December
 2019 in two different settings: a rural area in Uganda (a low-income country), and a semi-
 urban township in Cape Town, South Africa (a middle-income country). The main objective
 of the project was to formulate and implement a contextually appropriate self-management
 strategy for the prevention and control of T2D in each setting and to evaluate its outcomes [10,
 11]. As part of the project, a pragmatic cluster randomized trial was designed and imple-
 mented to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of integrated facility plus community 
<section> care interventions, compared to facility care only, in improving T2D management outcomes
 among patients with diabetes, and individuals at high risk of T2D in Uganda and South Africa.
 The Self-determination theory (SDT) [12] was used as part of the theoretical framework for
 our study and its relevance was tested using the baseline data of the SMART2D trial. The aim
 of the analysis reported in this article was to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions
 towards improvement of T2D prevention and management outcomes in the two countries.
 
<section> Materials and methods
 
<section> Ethics statement
 
<section> In Uganda, approval for the study was obtained from the Research and Ethics Committee of
 the Makerere University School of Public Health (reference number 426), and from the
 Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (reference number HS 2118). In South
 Africa, approval was obtained from the Biomedical Science Research Ethics Committee of the
 University of the Western Cape (reference number BM/17/1/36). Written informed consent
 was obtained from eligible subjects before enrollment in the study. Subjects not enrolled in the
 study but had a fasting plasma glucose test reading of at least 6.1 mmol/L, and were not into
 care were advised to as soon as possible report to the nearest government owned health facility
 for further evaluation.
 
<section> Study design and setting
 
<section> The study used a pragmatic cluster randomized trial design, to allocate clusters to study arms.
 Clusters were primary health care facilities and their respective catchment areas. In Uganda,
 health facility was eligible for inclusion into the trial if it provided primary health care, and
 was at least 5 kilometers away from an already selected one. Using these two criteria, nine
 health primary health care facilities were selected with the aim of being able to randomize
 three facilities to each of the three study arms. In South Africa, facilities were assessed for eligi-
 bility based on facilities being managed by the same governance structure and existence of a
 community-based platform for T2D services support. Based on these criteria, two primary
 health care facilities were selected. The primary study units were patients with diabetes, and
 individuals at high risk of T2D recruited within each of the study clusters. Recruitment of
 potential participants was then conducted within the catchment areas, and at the health facili-
 ties as described below.
 In South Africa, the trial included two study arms; a facility plus community care (integrated
 care) arm, and a facility only care (facility care) arm. Because in South Africa facility care pro-
 vides the required standard of care for patients with diabetes, the facility care arm served as the
 control arm with no study interventions; whereas the integrated care arm served as the inter-
 vention arm. In Uganda where primary care processes for diabetes are not regularly fully pro-
 vided at primary health care facilities, the trial had three study arms including the two study
 arms as in South Africa, plus a usual care arm that served as the control arm. We made no inter-
 ventions in the usual care arm except provision of diabetes medications to avoid stock outs.
 
<section> Eligibility criteria
 
<section> Subjects were eligible for participation in the study if they fulfilled the following criteria: aged
 between 30 and 75 years, had resided in their respective communities for at least 6 months,
 had no plans of out-migrating from the study area over the next 12 months; able to provide
 written informed consent; allow home visits and follow-up contacts; and a diagnosis of diabe-
 tes of no longer than 12 months, or if classified as being at high risk of T2D. A subject was 
<section> classified as having diabetes if he/she had already been diagnosed with diabetes and was in
 care for diabetes at the study health facility, or if they had at least two fasting plasma glucose
 test readings of greater than 7.0 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) conducted by our study staff on
 two separate days within two weeks prior to enrollment into the study. In Uganda, a subject
 was classified as being at high risk of T2D if they had pre-diabetes, defined as having at least
 two fasting plasma glucose test readings of between 6.1–6.9 mmol/L conducted by our study
 staff on two separate days within two weeks prior to enrollment into the study. In South Africa,
 a subject was classified as being at high risk of T2D if they had a random plasma glucose test
 reading � 11 mmol/L, a BMI of at least 25, and having one or more of the following: hyperten-
 sion, a cardiovascular disease, physical inactivity, family history of T2D, or previous gestational
 diabetes. Pregnancy and serious mental disability were exclusion criteria. Once eligibility was
 confirmed, written informed consent was obtained and the subject enrolled into the study.
 
<section> Interventions
 
<section> The facility care arm comprised two intervention strategies including: 1) organization of care
 at facility level, and 2) strengthening of the patient role in self-management. The integrated
 care arm included the two intervention strategies in the facility care arm, plus three commu-
 nity intervention strategies including: 1) community mobilization (including dissemination
 messages on healthy lifestyles to community members and key stakeholders); 2) creating a sup-
 portive environment by establishing peer support groups and identifying a care companion
 for each participant; and, 3) establishing a community extension link between the facility and
 the community for the care of patients. Interventions in this trial are hence related to clusters.
 In Uganda, study health facilities were supported with medication and diabetes diagnostic
 equipment, reagents and strips to address critical gaps in usual care that would otherwise influ-
 ence trial implementation. Details of the various elements within each intervention strategy
 have been described elsewhere [13]. Participants were exposed to the intervention strategies
 for at least 9 months. Most of the intervention strategies were developed based on principles
 the Self Determination Theory (SDT) [14]. The theoretical framework and development of the
 care interventions have been described elsewhere [11, 15].
 
<section> Measurements
 
<section> Following enrollment, trained study staff administered a standardized questionnaire to obtain
 baseline data that included: socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, level of education,
 marital status) and behavioral characteristics (alcohol use, tobacco use, self-reported levels of
 physical activity, food consumption patterns, foot care, and medical and medication history).
 Physical measurements included weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure measure-
 ments; and a baseline glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
 Blood pressure (BP) was measured using a digital upper arm sphygmomanometer
 (Omron1 M3 series, Omron Healthcare Inc.), with three measurements taken at least five
 minutes apart. The mean of the last two BP measurements was used in the analysis. Weight
 was measured using a digital weighing scale (Seca 813, Hanover, USA) and height was mea-
 sured using a roll-up stadiometer (Seca 213, Hanover, USA). Body mass index (BMI) was cal-
 culated by dividing the participant’s weight in kilograms by the height in meters squared (kg/
 m ). Waist circumference was measured using a measuring tape with the participant in light
 clothing. Plasma glucose was measured using a point of care glucometer (Accucheck ) by
 Roche, which uses 10 microliters (μL) of capillary blood derived from a finger prick, and the
 Cobas b101 point-of-care analyzer (in Uganda) and the Alfinion AS100 Analyser (in South
 Africa) were used to measure HbA1c levels in millimoles/mole (mmol/mol) using 5 μL of 
<section> capillary blood to provide results that are free from hemoglobin variant interference, which
 National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) certified.
 Each participant was followed for up to 12 months or until death, withdrawal of consent,
 loss to follow-up. Follow-up of participants was completed at all country sites by the end of
 December 2019.
 
<section> Quality control of interventions administration
 
<section> In both countries, a contextualized structured training program guided intervention adminis-
 tration including pre-intervention training as well as quality control during the implementa-
 tion phase. In Uganda, regular support supervision visits were conducted to the health
 facilities to ensure that the interventions were implemented according to protocol and with
 sufficient dose of exposure, fidelity and reach. During the visits, study team members checked
 and re-enforced health worker compliance to key elements of the intervention e.g. ensuring
 stock out of key medicines and testing equipment, compliance with treatment guidelines, task
 shifting, maintenance of the patient information system, and supporting the patient role in
 self-care. Similar support was given to the community level interventions. In South Africa,
 where the intervention focused mainly on the community interventions, quality assurance vis-
 its were implemented to supervise peer support groups to check for intervention fidelity;
 monthly mock peer group sessions were organized and refresher training in diabetes manage-
 ment. Record keeping practices were also supported to improve reporting feedback.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome among participants with diabetes was glycemic control at month 12,
 and among participants at high risk of T2D was reduction in HbA1c levels of at least 3 mmol/
 mol between baseline and month 12. Glycemic control was defined using the American Diabe-
 tes Association definition, i.e. having an HbA1c reading below 53 mmol/mol (7.0% using the
 Diabetes Control and Complications Trial method) [16] at month 12. Regarding reduction in
 HbA1c levels of at least 3 mmol/mol by month 12 among participants at high risk of T2D, we
 decided to use this cutoff based on findings from an intervention trial reported by Katula et
 (2021) that aimed at reducing HbA1c levels among people with pre-diabetes [17]. In this
 study, investigators observed significant reduction in HbA1c levels, an average of -2.52 mmol/
 mol [95% CI = -2.89 –-2.16]. Based on this, we decided to use a cutoff reduction of 3 mmol/
 mol by month 12. Secondary outcomes included: i) retention into care defined as having
 returned for the month 12 clinic appointment and endline measurements done within 14 days
 of the appointment date, and, ii) incident T2D diabetes defined as a participant at high risk for
 T2D whose baseline HbA1c test reading was less than 48 mmol/mol (6.5%), but had an HbA1c
 test reading of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) or greater at month
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> A detailed description of sample size calculations has been reported elsewhere, showing the
 number of clusters with unequal sizes, the coefficient of intra-cluster correlation (ICC), and
 the other parameters used in the calculations [13].
 
<section> Data management and analysis
 
<section> At each country site, research data was managed by trained data managers, with regular data
 cleaning, and quarterly upload into RedCap software onto a server via secure links. The data-
 base password was protected at all levels, with access only to authorized study staff. 
<section> Important to note is that although the units of allocation to study arms were the health facil-
 ities, the units of analysis were the individual participants. We report the percentage of partici-
 pants with T2D that achieved glycemic control, the percentage of participants at high risk that
 achieved reduction in HbA1c of at least 3 mmol/mol between baseline and month 12, the per-
 centage of participants at high risk that progressed to T2D by month 12 (incident T2D), and
 the percentage of participants with T2D and those at high risk that were retained into care. For
 the two primary outcomes (glycaemic control and reduction in HbA1c of at least 3 mmol/
 mol), participants that were lost to follow-up, their missing data were imputed using multiple
 imputations based on a "missing at random assumption". Imputations were created based on
 fully conditional specification which imputes multivariate missing data on a variable-by-vari-
 able basis in an iterative fashion [18]. For the calculation of the imputation values, we used pre-
 dictive mean matching, an implicit model which is assumed robust to misspecification.
 Standard Error (SE) estimates were pooled based on Rubin’s rules across 10 imputed data sets.
 All model variables and additional extraneous variables (i.e. marital status, employment and
 income) were used as predictors. The procedure was done using the “Mice” package in R [19].
 A sensitivity analysis was run in which missing outcomes were set equal to "not having the out-
 come of interest". For the secondary outcome retention into care, analyses were conducted
 using the intention-to-treat analysis strategy [20]. In this strategy, all participants enrolled in
 the trial are included in the analysis as recommended by CONSORT guidelines.
 Adjusted analyses were conducted separately for each country. By design, within each
 country the data had a two-level structure, i.e. individual level (level 1) and health facility level
 (level 2). Multilevel modified Poisson regression modeling was used to take into account this
 hierarchical structure, with individual participants nested within the health facility of enroll-
 ment. The health facility indicator was included in the model as a random effect, except for
 South Africa where only one facility per arm was included. The modified Poisson regression
 model provides estimated incident rate ratios (IRR) of the outcome of interest, comparing
 rates of the outcome of interest across the different categories of independent variables. Modi-
 fied Poisson regression modeling was preferred over logistic regression modeling to avoid
 underestimation of the standard errors for the estimated risk ratios that is usually encountered
 with logistic regression modeling when the prevalence of the outcome is greater than 10% [21,
 22]. To adjust for imbalances of relevant population characteristics at baseline, adjusted analy-
 sis modeling was weighted using propensity scores. These scores were calculated using gradi-
 ent boosted logistic regression, a supervised nonparametric machine learning technique
 available in R’s ’twang’ package [23], with the trial arm as the outcome and relevant baseline
 characteristics of participants as the covariates [24, 25].
 Furthermore, we controlled for the various baseline covariates including socio-demo-
 graphic characteristics (age, sex, education level, marital status), physical characteristics (BMI),
 behavioral characteristics (tobacco use, alcohol use, physical activity levels), and health status
 indicators (hypertension status and baseline HbA1c test reading). The covariates were pre-
 determined during the planning of the study, and selection of these was based on theory, and
 previous similar research. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 14 [26]
 and R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) [27].
 
<section> Patient and public involvement
 
<section> Local community leaders and other key stakeholder were involved in the design and development
 of the SMART2D intervention elements as described in detail elsewhere [10, 11]. At the end of
 the trial, the local community leaders, selected study participant representatives and care compan-
 ions participated in a workshop of dissemination of findings from the trial to policy makers. 
<section> Results
 
<section> Enrollment and follow-up
 
<section> Between th January 2017 and 30 
<section> th November 2018 health care facilities and individuals were
 screened for eligibility to participate in the study. In Uganda, out of the 101 facilities screened
 nine were selected, whereas in South Africa, out of the 9 facilities, two were selected. In
 Uganda, 28,175 subjects residing in the nine cluster areas were screened, out of which
 were enrolled (424 with T2D and 377 at high risk). In South Africa, 1,584 subjects were
 screened at the selected health facilities out of which 566 were enrolled (281 with T2D and 285
 at high risk. Figs 1 and 2 summarize the trial schema for Uganda and South Africa, respec-
 tively; giving details of the distribution of numbers from screening through enrollment, loss
 follow-up, and number of participants analyzed by study arm; and Table 1 summarizes the
 number of participants by cluster.
 
<section> Baseline characteristics of participants
 
<section> Details of the baseline characteristics of participants, stratified by country site and by study
 arm are presented in Table 2. Among participants with diabetes, significant differences
 between the study arms in Uganda were observed only in the percentage of participants with
 hypertension, which was significantly lower in the integrated care arm than the other two
 arms. In South Africa, participants in the integrated care arm had significantly lower mean
 age, BMI and percentage of participants with hypertension but higher mean HbA1c than par-
 ticipants in the facility care arm.

<section> significant differences were observed in South Africa between the two study arms. However
 Uganda, a significantly higher percentage of retention into care was observed in the integrated
 care arm at 86.5% compared to that in the facility care arm at 61.1% (p< 0.001). Moreover, a
 significantly lower percentage of retention into care was observed in the usual care arm at
 24.8%, compared to the other two arms combined (p< 0.001) (Table 4).
 Adjusted analysis showed that in Uganda, compared to the usual care arm, rates of reten-
 tion into care were significantly higher in the facility care arm with an IRR = 2.46 [1.33–4.43],
 and in the integrated care arm with an IRR = 3.52 [2.13–5.80]. However there was no signifi-
 cant difference in rates of retention into care in the integrated care arm compared to the facil-
 ity care arm.
 In South Africa, rates of retention into care were significantly higher in the integrated care
 arm compared to the facility care arm, with an IRR = 1.02 [1.02–1,03] (Table 4).
 
<section> Effectiveness of the trial interventions on Incident T2D among participants at high

 at baseline. Of these, 15 (4.6%) progressed to T2D; of which 9 out of 217 (4.1%) were in
 Uganda, and 6 out of 142 (4.2%) were in South Africa (p = 0.971). We found no significant dif-
 ference in the percentage of participants at high risk that progressed to T2D between the study
 arms, neither in Uganda, nor in South Africa. Because of the small number of incident T2D
 cases observed in the study, adjusted analysis comparing incident rates of T2D between the
 study arms was not possible.

<section> Discussion
 
<section> We found significant improvements in retention into care comparing improved facility care
 current usual care, and an added value of integrated care that included peer support in both
 countries. Overall, the effect size estimates of integrated care on retention into care were larger
 in Uganda, especially among participants at high risk of T2D.
 The significant effect of the interventions on retention into care implies that a considerably
 less proportion of participants was lost to follow-up in the intervention arms of the study, that
 is, in South Africa the integrated care arm; and in Uganda the facility care and integrated care
 arms. This effect was relatively high in some study arms compared to others, resulting in highly
 unbalanced data between control (i.e. usual care) and intervention arms (i.e. facility only or
 integrated care). Because of this considerable and unbalanced loss to follow-up, the validity
 our findings with regards to the effect the study intervention on the primary outcomes of gly-
 caemic control and reduction in HbA1c might be questionable, despite having used multiple
 imputations [28] to address the missing data during analysis. Sensitivity analysis comparing
 the results of the multiple imputation analysis with those of intention-to-treat in which all
 cases lost to follow-up were set ’not having the outcome of interest’ [20] (see S1 Table), reveals
 strong differences between both approaches which may further question the validity of our
 results. The unexpectedly high number of missingness also reduced the power of our study
 which may explain why we did not find significant differences between the study arms for the
 primary outcomes. We conclude that in pragmatic implementation trials such as the present
 study with the objective to enhance retention into care and glycemic control, may result in
 unbalanced missingness, hence compromising further assessment of the effectiveness.
 Although there is evidence for community-based peer support interventions in high-
 income countries, research from LMICs have shown inconsistent associations with improve-
 ments in clinical, behavioral, and psychological outcomes [6]. In our study, all positive find-
 ings were similar for both the integrated care arm and the facility care arm in Uganda,
 suggesting a stronger role for facility care. Still in Uganda, whereas community-based peer
 support strategies added no value for participants with T2D, participants at high risk benefited
 from integrated care in terms of retention into care. Put together, our findings point to the
 need for an adequately functioning primary care system for T2D management and a role of
 the community for T2D prevention.
 In the only previous study on peer support for diabetes self-management we were able to
 find in the Uganda context [29], Baumann et al (2015) conducted a small quasi-experimental
 study and their findings indicated improvements in HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure, and die-
 tary patterns. In our study, the intervention did not show a significant effect on reduction in
 HbA1c of at least 3 mmol/nol, but as mentioned before, the unbalanced loss-to-follow-up
 compromised valid analysis of the data. It is notable, however, that minimal changes at the
 facility level such as ensuring no medication stock-outs, availability of clinical monitoring
 equipment, etc. in Uganda, led to significant improvements in retention into care; especially
 among participants at high risk of T2D. Stock-outs and poor availability of essential medica-
 tion and diagnostic tests are known barriers to diabetes and non-communicable disease man-
 agement and prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa [30, 31].
 Further in Uganda where the standard of usual care is low for patients with T2D, and par-
 ticipants at high risk remain largely unidentified and untreated [32], our study was able to sig-
 nificantly improve retention into care in both participant groups, and in both intervention
 arms. However, people without a T2D diagnosis but with a high-risk diagnosis are a new
 patient group for health facilities and it seems community involvement was able to further
 improve their retention into care and HbA1c outcomes. Taken together, the findings from 
<section> Uganda call for further research on potential mediating factors related to self-management
 behaviors as well as implementation outcomes.
 The non-significant findings in South Africa in regards to reduction in HbA1c were similar
 to an earlier peer support intervention in the same context [33] which showed negligible effect
 in terms of primary and secondary outcomes. In that study, most intervention participants
 had not attended a single intervention session, and a qualitative process evaluation [34]
 revealed that intervention fidelity was also constrained. Despite continued efforts to monitor
 intervention fidelity in our study, it is probable that failure to achieve a significant difference
 in HbA1c in South Africa could be attributed to inadequate intervention implementation
 rather than intervention efficacy. Findings of an extensive process evaluation are currently
 being analyzed and already point to several issues, such as a low absorptive capacity among
 Community Health Workers (CHWs), insufficient supervision of CHWs and rapid staff turn-
 over and organizational change at the level of the implementing partner; security concerns,
 and low engagement of study participants which proved difficult without incentivization (e.g.
 FPG and BP measurement).
 In their systematic review on peer support interventions for diabetes self-management
 Werfalli et al [6] pointed at several reasons for inconsistent findings: low quality of studies,
 implementation issues, and lack of sufficient (contextualized) underlying theory to build the
 intervention. As discussed above, our study faced many challenges related to implementation
 especially in South Africa. Another challenge was related to selection of health care facilities
 trial clusters. In Uganda, the study area was large enough to avoid contamination between trial
 arms and to have enough clusters for successful randomization, which resulted in minor dif-
 ferences only between the study arms at baseline. In South Africa, where many other studies
 were conducted simultaneously in the same geographically restricted area, only two facilities
 could be selected for feasibility reasons, with large differences in demographic catchment areas
 as reflected in the baseline differences between both study arms. Among participants with T2D
 and those at high risk, the integrated care arm had significantly younger participants with a
 better risk factor profile. These differences imply that participants in the integrated care arm
 might have been less likely to adhere to the intervention due to e.g., work and family obliga-
 tions, and less likely to show benefits of the intervention due to their risk profile.
 In settings like the Uganda rural study setting where the current standard of care for people
 at risk of or with T2D is still poor, basic improvements in facility care improves retention into
 care. In this context we also see added value of community-based peer support to provide inte-
 grated care. We therefore recommend implementation of such measures, as minimal resources
 are needed. However, in South Africa, a middle-income urban setting with higher facility stan-
 dard of care and highly mobile populations, we could not demonstrate added value of inte-
 grated interventions beyond facility care. Here, more studies are called for to identify
 strategies that can further increase retention and glycemic control.

 intervention strategies on type 2 diabetes outcomes, beyond optimized health facility strategies
 in Uganda and South Africa, exemplifying a low- and middle-income setting that are facing
 challenges in tackling the type 2 diabetes burden. The study was designed with a solid evi-
 dence-base including, for example, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT), and utilized evi-
 dence-based and contextualized strategies contextualized based upon formative research and
 collaboration with local and sub-national stakeholders, to ensure relevance, acceptability and
 feasibility for scale-up. The study was able to demonstrate that when minimum level quality 
<section> care is lacking, even minimal improvements in the facility care like training nurses to follow-
 up patients and encourage participants to keep appointments; can provide significant
 improvements in retention into care and, potentially, in diabetes management outcomes.
 However, since the interventions were implemented as a package of intervention elements, we
 were unable to identify specific intervention elements that contributed towards improved T2D
 prevention and diabetes management outcomes.
 A major strength of our study was its theoretical underpinning. Many intervention studies
 either lack any explicit theory of change or they utilize a theory that has not been created or
 tested in a LMIC context. Our formative research provided evidence for SDT with regards to
 physical activity in the Uganda site and healthy eating and physical activity in the South Africa
 site [35–37]. Furthermore, SDT formed an essential part of the SMART2D self-management
 framework developed for this study [15]. Other strengths include the comprehensive situa-
 tional analysis in all participating country sites [10, 15, 35], participatory intervention develop-
 ment including research teams and key stakeholders [11], and a comprehensive process
 evaluation aiming for a deeper understanding of the effect of the intervention components
 through the analyses of secondary outcomes as potential mediators of change, as well as
 enablers and barriers for implementation. Together, these analyses can further explain which,
 why and how specific components were implemented and this may explain change in second-
 ary and main outcomes.
 Our study had some limitations that are important to point out. First, due to several ongo-
 ing studies in the South African study site, selection of clusters was limited and resulted in sev-
 eral baseline differences between the study arms that might have influenced the findings.
 Furthermore, ours was a complex health intervention and each intervention strategy had one
 or more intervention elements as described in the trial protocol publication [13]. Intervention
 elements differed slightly between both countries because of contextual adaptation. Complex
 health interventions are not usually generalizable except for their main ingredients, as imple-
 mentation in different settings should always take context into account.
