<section> Key questions
 
<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► Safety planning is a widely advocated intervention to
 respond to intimate partner violence (IPV).
 
<section> ► An mHealth-­based safety decision aid intervention
 for IPV survivors has demonstrated reductions in
 decisional conflict and increases in safety planning
 behaviours.
 
<section> ► To date, all mHealth safety planning interventions
 have occurred in high-­income settings.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► This study is, to our knowledge, the first trial eval-
 uating a technology-­based intervention for IPV pre-
 vention and response with support of trained lay
 providers in a low-­income or middle-­income setting.
 
<section> ► Survivors in the intervention group reported im-
 provements in safety preparedness and increased
 helpfulness of safety strategies used.
 
<section> ► Among women at the highest levels of violence se-
 verity, the intervention increased resilience (p<0.01)
 relative to control condition, and significantly de-
 creased risk for lethal violence by 3-­month follow-­
 up (p<0.01).
 
<section> What do the new findings imply?
 
<section> ► Technology implemented by lay professionals can be
 used to appropriately deliver safety interventions for
 IPV survivors in low-­resource settings.
 
<section> ► Tailored, app-­ based IPV prevention and response
 tools may reduce the public health impact of IPV,
 when situated alongside meaningful community-­
 based violence prevention and response efforts.
 
<section> Introduction
 Intimate partner violence (IPV) threatens
 the health and well-­being of women and girls
 globally. Eliminating IPV and other forms of
 gender inequity are targets of the sustainable
 development goals. 1 Intimate partners perpe-
 trate over one-­ third of female homicides. 
<section> Non-­fatal IPV consequences include poor mental, phys-
 ical and sexual health. 3 Evidence-­based prevention and
 response is urgently needed, particularly in low/middle-­
 income countries (LMICs), where support resources can
 be scarce. In Kenya, an estimated 39% of ever-­married
 women have experienced physical or sexual IPV.
 Enabling social norms include male-­dominated decision-­
 making and authority within relationships, as well as IPV
 tolerance that challenges women’s ability to seek help
 and identify abusive experiences. 5–7
 While a comprehensive approach to IPV requires
 addressing perpetration, sustained needs remain for
 supporting IPV survivors, particularly in high-­prevalence
 settings. Safety planning for harm reduction is one of
 the most widely recommended interventions for IPV
 prevention and response. Disclosing abuse and obtaining
 support can reduce self-­blame 8 and revictimisation. 9 Yet
 too few survivors receive formal support due to stigma,
 self-­blame and gaps in logistics and infrastructure. 10 11 In
 LMICs, limited available research shows that IPV survi-
 vors engage in active, intentional harm reduction and
 safety strategising, including engaging informal networks,
 removing stressors/avoidance, minimising damage to
 the self and family, and building personal resources. 12 In
 Nairobi’s informal settlements, IPV survivors face a host
 of barriers to safety, yet often take action steps in securing
 financial resources and personal property.
 Women often face multiple, competing priorities such
 as privacy, children and financial security in considering
 how to respond to IPV. Thus, a cornerstone of safety plan-
 ning is clarification of personal priorities. Decision science,
 which examines decision-­making processes and decisional
 conflict resolution, is a novel and underutilised tool for the
 IPV response. Decision aids can provide information about
 healthcare options, and clarify personal priorities to reduce
 decision-­related uncertainty and support decisions.
 The first decision aid to address IPV and safety plan-
 ning is myPlan, an interactive, personalised tool for survi-
 vors. Content is delivered via a secure app, developed by
 Johns Hopkins University (​www.​myplanapp.​org). myPlan
 provides healthy relationship education, and solicits
 information about a current intimate relationship,
 including risk of severe and lethal violence, reproductive
 coercion and safety priorities to prompt risk recogni-
 tion and generate safety strategies and referrals tailored
 to women’s priorities. 14 Key features include the self-­
 assessed ‘red flags’, or signs of an unhealthy intimate rela-
 tionship, and Danger Assessment, a validated measure of
 risk factors for severe and lethal relationship violence ;
 scores are converted to visuals to convey danger levels.
 Subsequently users complete an interactive prioritisa-
 tion of safety priorities (eg, well-­ being of child(ren),
 privacy, etc) via systematic pairwise comparison. Based
 on inputs, a personalised safety plan is generated with
 relevant referral information. Extensive electronic safety
 features include a four-­digit security personal identifi-
 cation number (PIN), a ‘dummy’ PIN that redirects to
 alternate content, and access via web or downloadable
 app to maximise options. In addition to decision science,
 myPlan is rooted theoretically in social cognitive theory,
 empowerment 17 and trauma-­ informed care, 18 which
 emphasise safety and empowerment through agency in
 decision-­making and healing. myPlan works to promote
 long-­term support and safety by providing support for (1)
 defining healthy relationships; (2) safety behaviour, by
 helping women identify the severity of the violence and
 potential danger to self and family and providing a set of
 options; (3) decision-­making, via clarifying safety prior-
 ities to reduce decisional conflict and enhancing safety
 preparedness; and (4) healing, via validating messages to
 counter the culture of victim blaming and stigma, bolster
 resilience and enable safety behaviour and connection to
 both formal services (eg, hotline, healthcare providers,
 advocates) and informal (family/friends, coworkers)
 networks. Reducing decisional conflict and self-­blame,
 and enhancing resilience and safety behaviours are crit-
 ical short-­term outcomes on the pathway to safety and
 violence prevention. myPlan has been implemented
 with racially and ethnically diverse populations in high-­
 resource settings (eg, USA, Canada, New Zealand and
 Australia). It has generated reductions in decisional
 conflict about safety, 19 20 increases in use of helpful safety
 strategies, 20 separation from abusive partners 20 and in
 some cases, reductions in violence severity. 21 The myPlan
 safety decision and planning intervention was adapted
 to the context of Nairobi, Kenya through an extensive
 community-­ partnered formative process. 22 Specifically,
 key informant interviews and focus group discussions
 with violence support service providers and female IPV
 survivors were used to refine app content and format.
 Recommendations emphasised graphics and efficiency,
 and the resulting adapted app was piloted and further
 refined based on user feedback.
 To test the intervention’s efficacy on safety and health
 outcomes over 3 months, we conducted a longitudinal
 randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the inter-
 vention with a control condition of standard IPV-­related
 referrals to community-­ based advocacy and support
 services. In-­depth interviews (IDIs) contextualised results
 and clarified intervention mechanisms. We hypothesised
 that the intervention would increase safety preparedness,
 reduce decisional conflict, increase use and helpfulness
 of safety behaviours, and reduce IPV exposure (primary
 outcomes). In addition, we examined secondary
 outcomes that include resilience, depression, use of IPV
 support services, self-­ blame, recognition of IPV, self-­
 efficacy, relationship quality and risk for severe/lethal
 violence. This RCT was conducted in Nairobi, Kenya to
 extend the limited knowledge base on mHealth in LMICs
 and advance the global priority of evidence-­based inter-
 ventions that prevent and respond to IPV.
 
<section> Methods
 Study design and participants
 This community-­ based RCT with a one-­ to-­ one alloca-
 tion ratio was conducted in three informal settlements 
<section> in Nairobi, Kenya in collaboration with Ujamaa-­Africa,
 a violence prevention and response non-­governmental
 organisation. Ujamaa’s Mashinani Program provides
 economic empowerment to IPV survivors via support
 groups, coupled with microfinance loans, affording the
 team unique insight into local IPV dynamics. Study sites
 were Korogocho/Kariobangi, Dandora and Huruma/
 Mathare; these sites are densely populated, low-­income
 informal settlement communities with a host of social and
 economic hazards for women, and a range of community-­
 based services. For expedience and sensitivity in enrolling
 IPV survivors for this randomised trial, sites were selected
 based on the established presence of Mashinani, relative
 economic diversity and geographical proximity.
 Community-­based methods, including flyers, commu-
 nity presentations and word of mouth, recruited women
 who had experienced physical or sexual IPV, or reported
 being afraid of their partner in the previous 3 months,
 resided in target communities with no plans to move
 in the next 6 months and spoke English or Swahili. Age
 eligibility was restricted to 18–35 years; this population
 was identified in the formative phase as high risk for IPV
 and likely to have highest technological literacy. Eligi-
 bility confirmation, oral informed consent and all study
 procedures occurred in person in private, community-­
 based, dedicated offices with skilled research assistants.
 The intervention adaptation phase, study protocol and
 procedures are available elsewhere.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 This randomised, controlled, participant-­blinded superi-
 ority trial entailed two parallel groups. Participants were
 randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either myPlan Kenya
 intervention or a standard of care control condition,
 stratified by study site. Computerised blocked randomi-
 sation provided site-­level stratification within the myPlan
 Kenya app.
 All participants and staff were blinded to intervention
 status with the exception of team members adminis-
 tering the intervention. The randomisation sequence
 (concealed from study staff) was programmed into
 a secure tracking database, separate from the study
 website, by the study programmer, who had no partici-
 pant contact.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> Participants completed the baseline survey with a trained
 research assistant in a private space in a community-­based
 organisation in each of the three settlements. The tablet
 computer was used for consent documentation, survey
 data collection and analytics, such as time to completion.
 Following baseline survey, tablet-­ based randomisation
 directed participants to the control or the intervention
 conditions, which were also administered via the tablet.
 Trained community health volunteer (CHVs), who
 worked with IPV survivors in the study communities and
 were technology literate, assisted in the use of the myPlan
 Kenya intervention app on the study tablet computer,
 based on formative phase recommendations to use CHVs
 to ease use and maximise comfort. 22 The research team
 and CHVs underwent a month-­ long training focused
 on data collection procedures, app content, tablet use,
 survey measures and ethical training specific to research
 on gender-­based violence.
 
<section> myPlan Kenya app intervention
 The myPlan Kenya app sections included the following:
 the Healthy Relationships section is educational and
 helps women to define healthy and unhealthy relation-
 ships as they reflect on their own relationship. My Rela-
 tionship asked the user to provide information on their
 relationship characteristics (eg, living together, married/
 partnered, children in home) to inform the tailoring of
 safety strategies. Red Flags assessed warning signs (eg,
 extreme jealousy, insults, threats, reproductive control).
 My Safety section provided an opportunity to self-­assess
 risk for severe and lethal violence using the validated
 Danger Assessment scale. 15 In the interactive My Priori-
 ties section, users made pairwise comparisons to weigh
 priorities such as dignity and respect, feelings for partner,
 health and children using a clickable ‘sliding bar’. The
 My Plan section provided the tailored safety plan that
 is populated based on data supplied by the user in the
 previous sections. The safety plan was followed by supple-
 mental information About Violence, Harmful Beliefs,
 and relevant Resources.
 
<section> Control condition
 The control condition consisted of a standard ‘usual
 care’ set of referrals to IPV-­related legal, health, safety,
 counselling and financial resources. For modality compa-
 rability, content was delivered in an app-­like webpage
 with research staff available for assistance.
 
<section> Immediate post intervention
 Following completion of intervention or control app
 content, participants completed a brief tablet-­ based
 exit survey to examine immediate safety preparedness.
 Research assistants then issued a brief verbal screener to
 monitor for any emotional upset triggered by the survey,
 and offered participants a small grocery item and trans-
 port reimbursement. All participants were offered a
 facilitated referral for IPV-­related medical, psychosocial
 or economic support. Participants in both groups had
 the option to return to the study centre to review their
 safety plan and referrals prior to 3-­month follow-­up visit,
 though no participants opted to do so.
 
<section> Three-month follow-up data collection and retention
 Participants were contacted for follow-­up data collection
 beginning 1 week prior to the 3-­month anniversary of
 their baseline study visit. Following informed consent,
 data collection procedures were identical to those at
 baseline. The myPlan Kenya app was offered to control
 participants following data collection. 
<section> In-depth interview
 Intervention participants retained at follow-­ up were
 eligible to participate in an IDI. Purposive sampling
 (n=30) ensured approximately equal distribution of
 baseline severity of IPV, and study sites (n=10 IDIs per
 site). Interest and scheduling were assessed immediately
 after follow-­up survey data collection, with all interviews
 occurring the following week with the same research
 team member. Semistructured interview guides focused
 on participant’s experiences with and recommendations
 for the intervention. Interviews were audio recorded,
 transcribed verbatim and translated to English language.
 Coding used inductive thematic analysis and focused on
 usefulness of the app and challenges/future recommen-
 dations; both presented herein. Emergent themes and
 subthemes detailed domains of helpfulness of strategies
 including referrals, and recommendations. Illustrative
 quotes that reflect overarching themes are presented.
 Quantitative results and qualitative themes were triangu-
 lated via convergence matrixes.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> Primary a priori outcomes included safety prepared-
 ness, decisional conflict, use and helpfulness of safety
 strategies and IPV experience. We report psychometric
 properties for scales at baseline (n=352). Measures
 were vetted locally and piloted with CHVs prior to use,
 resulting in minor refinements to enhance readability.
 The value of material provided with regard to safety
 preparedness, for example, how much the material
 reviewed assisted in decision-­ making and weighing
 risk/benefits, was assessed immediately following
 completion of intervention or control condition (exit
 survey) via 10-­item Likert scale (responses: 0—not at all
 to 4—a great deal; range: 0–40; α=0.90).
 
<section> With a 12-­item adapted Decisional Conflict Scale,
 participants rated knowledge, clarity and confidence
 in safety options and risk/benefits of potential safety
 options on a Likert scale (responses: 0—not at all to
 4—a great deal; range: 0–48; α=0.83). 14 Decisional
 conflict subscales included: uninformed (α=0.74),
 unclear values (α=0.52), lack of support (α=0.60) and
 uncertainty (α=0.81).
 Metrics specific to safety strategy use and helpfulness
 centred on five safety strategies specific to the myPlan
 app content, 9 14 for example, left the house temporarily
 to put space between you and your partner, developed
 an emergency signal to use with others when you felt you
 were in danger, put a plan into place for how to keep
 children safe. For each strategy, participants reported
 use (dichotomous), and, where applicable, helpful-
 ness (responses: 1—not helpful to 5—very helpful).
 
<section> Responses generated two summary metrics: use of safety
 strategies reflecting number of strategies used (range:
 0–5), and helpfulness of strategies used, reflecting both
 use and helpfulness by dividing summed helpfulness by
 number of strategies used (range: 0—never used to 5—
 used and found helpful).
 
<section> Physical and sexual IPV were assessed with short
 forms of the Revised Conflicts and Tactics Scale
 
<section> (CTS-2; α=0.87). 25 For each of 10 violent behaviours,
 women were asked frequency of occurrence in the past
 3 months: never (0), 1–2 times (1), 3+ times (2) and
 scores summed across behaviours (range: 0–20). The
 10-­item Women’s Experiences of Abuse Scale 26 captured
 emotional abuse (responses: 1—agree strongly to 6—
 disagree strongly; range: 10–60; α=0.89). Reproduc-
 tive coercion was assessed via nine-­item existing scale
 (α=0.86), summarised into a binary measure indicative
 of experience/no experience.
 Secondary outcomes included resilience (10-­ item
 
<section> Connor-­Davidson Scale; responses: 0—not true at all
 to 4—true nearly all the time; range: 0–40; α=0.82),
 depression (10-­item Center for Epidemiologic Studies
 
<section> Depression Scale ; responses: 0—not at all/less than
 1 day to 3—nearly every day; range: 0–30; α=0.82;
 modelled continuously and dichotomously with depres-
 sion indicated at score≥10), self-­blame (three-­item
 adaptation of the characterological subscale of the
 
<section> Sexual Victimization Attributions Measure ; responses:
 0—never to 4—almost always; range: 0–12; α=0.69),
 recognition of abuse (six-­item adapted Abusive Behav-
 iors Scale ; responses: 0—not abusive at all to 4—very
 abusive; range: 0–24; α=0.78), self-­efficacy (six-­item
 
<section> Generalized Self-­ 
<section> Efficacy Scale ; responses: 1—not
 true at all to 4—exactly true; range: 6–24; α=0.80),
 safety-­specific self-­efficacy (four-­item Self-­Efficacy for
 
<section> Safety in Relationship Scale ; responses: 1—strongly
 disagree to 5—strongly agree; range: 4–20; α=0.70) and
 risk for severe/lethal violence (20-­item Danger Assess-
 ment Scale ; range 0–20; α=0.84; intervention partic-
 ipants only). Relationship quality was added based
 on local input (four-­item scale adapted from CTS-2
 negotiation subscale; responses: 0—never to 3—almost
 always; range: 0–12; α=0.70). 25 Support service consid-
 eration and use, respectively, were assessed for health,
 emergency, police/chief, legal, crisis hotline, counsel-
 ling, housing and child services individually. Self-­blame
 was the only measure from which items were dropped
 to improve psychometric properties (α improved from
 0.58 to 0.69 after dropping from four to three items).
 
<section> Analysis
 
<section> This superiority trial aimed to evaluate myPlanKenya as
 compared with the standard of care control condition,
 and was designed with 80% power to detect differences
 in IPV between the two study groups, assuming 24%
 prevalence in the intervention compared with 39% in
 the control, 15% attrition and alpha at 0.05; 350 partic-
 ipants were required (175 per group).
 Analyses were conducted from November 2018 to
 April 2019, using STATA V.14. The intent-­ to-­ treat,
 differences-­ in-­ differences approach used random
 effects logistic and linear regression models. Primary
 analysis used a group*time (pre/post) interaction
 term and accounted for within-­person clustering and

 recruitment site. Main effects analyses stratified by
 intervention group explored effects underpinning
 the interaction term. Significance was set at 5%. Mean
 imputation handled small amounts of missing data
 (<2%) for the majority of outcomes and up to <6%
 for resilience, decisional conflict and exit-­survey safety
 preparedness.
 To explore effect modification, analyses were strat-
 ified based on IPV severity, resilience and previous
 (3 months prior to baseline) violence-­ related help-­
 seeking, with resulting group by time interaction coef-
 ficients compared by strata.
 
<section> Patient and public involvement
 This community-­ engaged study sought public and
 end-­ user input at all phases. During the formative
 research stage, input from IPV survivors and stake-
 holders informed and finalised myPlan Kenya content,
 supported implementation and length of administra-
 tion. CHV and end-­user input informed the refinement
 of the logic model, and selection of survey constructs
 (eg, relationship quality), and ensured face validity and
 accurate translation of all survey measures. Interven-
 tion and surveys were piloted before implementation to
 assess time burden. All recruitment was conducted by
 CHVs who had worked with IPV survivors in the selected
 communities. Preliminary findings were disseminated
 at an event in November 2018 involving clinics, govern-
 ment representatives, elders/faith leaders, community-­
 based organisations and CHVs from each of the study
 communities. Readiness assessment for further dissem-
 ination is underway.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Quantitative findings
 Participant recruitment occurred from April to August
 2018, with 3-­month follow-­up from July 2018 to October
 2018. Of the 407 participants screened for eligibility,
 352 were consented and enrolled at baseline (86.48%;
 n=175 control, n=177 intervention; figure 1). A total of
 312 participants were retained at 3-­month follow-­up and
 included in subsequent analyses (88.64%, n=155 control,
 n=157 intervention). Commonly cited reasons for loss
 to follow-­up were inability to return (n=16), relocation
 (n=11) and inability to contact using safe contact infor-
 mation (n=10). Three participants asked to discontinue
 the study. One participant completed baseline data collec-
 tion but did not complete the intervention; per intention
 to treat, she was included in the difference-­in-­difference
 analysis. Attrition was non-­differential on baseline demo-
 graphics and IPV severity; retained participants were
 significantly (p<0.05) more likely to report depressive
 symptoms consistently and report their abusive partner
 had concurrent partners.
 Participants were predominantly married (84.94%;
 table 1) and cohabitating with their partner (85.90%),
 with a mean age of 26.52 years old (SD=4.70) and 2.06
 children (SD=1.14). Slightly more than half (51.28%)
 had completed primary school or less and the vast
 majority (94.23%) were unemployed. Randomisation
 achieved equal distribution by group.
 Immediately post intervention, safety preparedness
 was higher for intervention participants as compared
 with control (36.05 vs 34.52; b=1.42; p<0.05; table 2),
 controlling for baseline decisional conflict. For use of
 helpful safety strategies, a group by time interaction was

 Among participants exposed to multiple forms of IPV
 (CTS >=13; figure 2), significant time by group interaction
 effects were identified for helpfulness of safety strate-
 gies used (p<0.01) and resilience (p<0.01); immediate
 post-­ intervention safety preparedness was significantly
 higher for intervention participants relative to controls
 (p<0.05), and risk for severe and lethal violence declined
 significantly from baseline to follow-­up (p<0.01) in the
 intervention group. In results stratified by past 3-­month
 service use at baseline, improvements in helpfulness of
 safety strategies used, decisional conflict and resilience
 were concentrated among participants who had previ-
 ously sought IPV-­related services (all p<0.05), with no
 significant time by group interaction effects identified
 among participants who were IPV-­service naive.

 referenced strengths including its tailoring of their
 personal situation, and the availability of options that
 supported safety while staying in relationships, recog-

 the presence of violence.

 got to a point where he developed ulcers. I felt that my
 child’s health was affected…[so] I felt that that strategy was 
<section> important… if you only prevent physical harm, there may
 still be emotional harm.

<section> Speaking up about abuse
 Women explained that the intervention experience
 enhanced their ability to disclose violence to trusted
 friends and family. Though confidants were not always
 helpful, women gained confidence in reaching out for
 help.
 
<section> When I came here, I got good at speaking up. I confide
 in my parents or even his or my friends because it will be
 beneficial.
 
<section> —26 years, Dandora
 
<section> There are times when you are stressed, you don’t have to
 keep it to yourself, you need to pay your friend a visit and
 have a casual conversation to eliminate that stress.

<section> De-escalation
 Women explained that persevering in the face of IPV was
 common pre-­myPlan Kenya. Post intervention, women
 described using de-­escalation tactics, such as choosing
 not to engage with a drunk or upset partner, and tempo-
 rarily leaving to provide physical space.
 
<section> Now, when he comes home, I study his mood so that I
 know how to handle him in order to avoid the chaos. While
 talking to him, you can know from his reactions that it will
 lead [to] violence. You need to wait for him to cool down
 before talking to him. If I see he is unhappy when he comes
 home, I normally keep quiet until he starts a conversation.

<section> In regards to my safety, when he seems like he is spoiling
 for a fight, I would stay away from him and come back
 when he has calmed down.

<section> Financial independence
 Strategies related to supporting financial independence
 were described as useful in reducing monetary-­driven
 arguments and provide peace-­of-­mind surrounding provi-
 sion of basic needs for themselves and their children.
 
<section> I decided to find some little money and start selling clothes.
 This has really helped me. I can buy food for my children,
 unlike when I used to just wait for my partner; at times he
 would come and say he did not have money for food and
 beat me up.

<section> IPV support services and referrals: strengths and challenges
 Women described important gains in knowledge about
 available services as a result of the intervention.
 
<section> I did not know that there is a way for women who are in
 trouble. You can be directed to people who can assist you.
 I knew that once you are assaulted, that’s it, life ends there.
 After going through myPlan, I learnt that there are facilities
 and steps that can be taken in case you have a problem in
 your marriage.
 
<section> —33 years, Korogocho
 
<section> Simultaneously, women’s chief concerns with the inter-
 vention centred on the helpfulness of resource referrals,
 reflecting gaps in the underlying IPV response commu-
 nity. While most services were welcomed, participants
 cited past negative experiences with law enforcement
 in particular, and questioned the value of including law
 enforcement as an option for IPV response.
 So when I went to the police. Since [my partner] has mon-
 ey, he was able to bribe them and was set free and the po-
 lice did not pursue the case. When I took him to the chief,
 he bribed the chief…[I have gone to the police and chief]
 about four times now. I got tired and gave up.
 
<section> —30 years, Korogocho
 
<section> The security purpose where you’re being told have you vis-
 ited government help like the chief? You’re not supposed
 to put that chief. They have no use. They don’t help wom-
 en.
 
<section> —27 years, Dandora
 
<section> Several participants also suggested including churches
 as referral resources.
 
<section> Additional challenges & recommendations: ensuring high-quality
 
<section> communication
 Women’s recommendations for improvement centred
 on ensuring access for low literacy populations as well
 as those whose native language is neither Swahili nor
 English. They recommended audio or in-­person assis-
 tance to support communication.
 Triangulation of qualitative and quantitative results
 (table 3) identified areas of convergence as well as diver-
 gence. Results related to decisional conflict and safety
 strategies converged across quantitative and qualitative
 results, with qualitative findings adding nuance to quan-
 titative evidence of improvements in aspects of deci-
 sional conflict and use of helpful safety strategies. Results
 diverged in domains of IPV experience and services.
 Specifically, IDIs described helpfulness of the app in miti-
 gating abuse, yet quantitative results showed decreases
 in IPV in both arms. IDIs indicated relevance of IPV-­
 related referrals and importance of confidence gained
 for garnering support; however, quantitative results were
 null with regard to IPV-­related services.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> This study represents the first longitudinal trial of the
 adapted myPlan Kenya safety decision and planning
 intervention delivered via a secure app to survivors in
 Nairobi, Kenya. Women who used the myPlan Kenya app
 had significantly improved safety preparedness immedi-
 ately post intervention compared with the control group.
 At 3-­month follow-­up, intervention women had a greater
 increase in use of helpful safety strategies and felt they
 had information needed to make safety decisions, both

 aligned with the intervention’s theory of change. There
 were no significant between-­group differences in IPV or
 depression, likely reflecting the relatively short follow-­up
 duration, which contrasts with the dynamic and lengthy
 process of decision-­making, safety planning and achieving
 longer term safety for women in abusive relationships.
 Among women reporting more violent and abusive
 behaviours by the partner at baseline, women in the
 intervention group reported significantly greater resil-
 ience and helpfulness of the safety strategies they used
 relative to control participants. Among women who had
 previously sought services for IPV, intervention women
 reported improvements in resilience and helpfulness
 of safety strategies and a reduction in decision conflict
 about safety. These endpoints are important on women’s
 trajectories towards safety, and suggest that the interven-
 tion can be valuable for bolstering change in safety even
 for those already in touch with services. Results provide
 promising efficacy evidence for the myPlan safety deci-
 sion and planning intervention with IPV survivors in an
 urban, low-­resource settlements.
 Findings affirm the value of human-­ centred design
 in appropriately adapting technology to context.
 Technology-­ based interventions are often falsely
 contrasted with people-­ powered interventions, with
 the implication that technology-­ based interventions
 can replace skilled advocates and providers. This inter-
 vention is distinct from a static webpage or app in that
 it is evidence-­based, tailored, codesigned with survivors
 in local languages. Further, it contains extensive safety
 features and is delivered through technology appro-
 priate to the context. Our human-­centred design phase
 revealed that the most appropriate app delivery method
 was with support trained lay professional CHVs; this was 
<section> found acceptable and appropriate for both parties. The
 resulting intervention achieved results comparable to
 those from trials in high-­income settings. 19–21 Our tech-
 nology adaptation process and supported app implemen-
 tation may be relevant for other lower resource settings
 where the rapid expansions in mobile accessibility have
 not yet been matched in technology literacy and comfort
 for some populations.
 Results stratified by past IPV service use are particu-
 larly informative in understanding women’s processes
 of behavioural change. The intervention was effective in
 reducing decisional conflict and improving resilience for
 women who had previously sought IPV-­related services.
 Prior service use may be a marker for readiness for change;
 alternately myPlan Kenya, tailored to the survivors’ situ-
 ation, may have amplified, extended and/or reinforced
 the availability and value of IPV services and working
 closely with skilled advocates and providers. Results
 illustrate that app-­based safety planning tools constitute
 a valuable element of comprehensive IPV prevention
 and support services, and function in part by enhancing
 connection to existing services, and extending the value
 of existing services. They are by no means a replacement
 and will function best when effectively integrated as one
 of many options.
 Other IPV prevention trials have reported IPV
 decreases in both groups. 20 The structured baseline
 assessments may have conferred benefits; however, there
 were no overtime changes in either group in self-­blame,
 recognition of abuse, nor consideration nor uptake of
 IPV-­ related services. Qualitative results speak to inter-
 vention acceptability and its impact on recognition of
 services and reduced isolation. The divergence of qual-
 itative and quantitative results for IPV and IPV-­related
 services suggests that quantitative study measures may not
 have been sufficiently sensitive. Both groups improved
 modestly on safety-­ specific self-­ efficacy, which could
 contribute to enhanced safety. A longer follow-­up period
 is warranted to clarify intervention effects on longer
 term outcomes of safety and mental health, as well as
 durability over time. This trial conducted in a controlled
 environment did not support questions related to dose
 viewed and dose–response as they relate to primary and
 secondary outcomes; both are important future research
 questions.
 Strengths include successful randomisation, adher-
 ence to protocol with 88% retention, qualitative inter-
 views with intervention participants and no reported
 adverse events. Study measures were refined by the
 community-­ partnered study team. Limitations include
 the 3-­month follow-­up duration and the limited gener-
 alisability with recruitment in a single city. Several
 important measures demonstrated limited performance,
 specifically subdomains of the decisional conflict scale, as
 well as the self-­blame assessment; these results should be
 interpreted with caution and further work is needed to
 strengthen measurement in these areas. The community-­
 based recruitment may have limited reach to the most
 vulnerable women, including those fearful of seeking
 help from CHVs.
 Trial results are comparable to those in high-­income
 countries 19–21 in demonstrating improvements in safety
 preparedness, decreases in aspects of decisional conflict
 about safety, and increases in use of helpful safety strate-
 gies following this intervention. Further, among women
 reporting severe IPV, those in the intervention group
 reported increased resilience and reduction in risk for
 lethal violence. The innovation here is twofold. First,
 safety decision-­ making and planning interventions
 codesigned with IPV survivors in local languages, with
 extensive safety features, and delivered through tech-
 nology appropriate to the context are similarly effective
 in this LMIC-­based urban settlement as in high-­resource
 settings. Second, myPlan Kenya app is acceptable and
 feasible for use by survivors with support from a trained
 lay professional, in a private location in a community-­
 based organisation. Findings advance the evidence base
 on IPV prevention and response tools for diverse settings
 with high IPV prevalence and limited advocacy and
 support services.
