 The primary endpoint was placental malaria, determined
 by placental histology, and the key secondary endpoints
 Received 14 January 2019 were birth weight, gestational age, vital status of the
 Revised 16 May 2019 newborn baby and maternal anaemia.
 Accepted 25 May 2019 Results Between April 2012 and September 2015, 6868
 women were enrolled; 3300 in 46 ISTp clusters and 3568
 in 41 PCD clusters. In the ISTp arm, 4.9% of women were
 tested malaria positive and 0.6% in the PCD arm. There
 was no difference in the prevalence of placental malaria in
 the ISTp (87/1454, 6.0%) and PCD (65/1560, 4.2%) groups
 (6.0% vs 4.2%; OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.29, p=0.29) or
 in any of the secondary endpoints.
 
<section> Conclusion ISTp detected more infections than PCD, but
 monthly ISTp with the current generation of RDT is unlikely
 to reduce placental malaria or impact on pregnancy
 outcomes. ISTp trials with more sensitive point-of-care
 diagnostic tests are needed.

<section> Key questions
 
<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► In low malaria transmission areas, testing pregnant
 women for malaria when they present with clinical
 symptoms (passive case detection (PCD) is the stan-
 dard of care.
 
<section> ► In high malaria transmission areas, intermittent pre-
 ventive treatment with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine
 (IPT-SP) during monthly antenatal visits is the stan-
 dard of care to reduce the consequences of malaria
 in pregnancy (MiP).
 
<section> ► It has been shown that intermittent screening with a
 rapid diagnostic test and treatment for malaria (ISTp)
 during antenatal visits is not inferior to IPT-SP.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► In a low transmission area in India, 70% of MiP was
 asymptomatic and ISTp detected more cases of MiP
 than PCD (4.9% vs 0.6%, p<0.001), but had no im-
 pact on the risk of placental malaria or other adverse
 birth outcomes.
 
<section> What do the new findings imply?
 
<section> ► Given that the majority of women infected with ma-
 laria remain asymptomatic, ISTp during antenatal
 care could be considered in low transmission areas
 in India.
 
<section> MiP, the WHO recommends effective treat-
 ment, insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs)
 and, in areas of moderate-to-high malaria
 transmission of sub-Saharan Africa, intermit-
 tent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine–
 pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP). 3 IPTp-SP is given
 at each antenatal clinic (ANC) attendance
 after the first trimester, regardless of whether
 the recipient is infected with malaria or not. In
 low transmission settings, the use of IPTp-SP
 is questionable because the benefit/risk
 ratio of this intervention is likely to be low. 
<section> In such areas, intermittent screening for malaria during
 antenatal visits using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and
 treating test-positive women with an effective antimalarial
 drug (ISTp) is a potential alternative option. 5
 In India, malaria transmission is relatively low and
 varies markedly between different ecological settings.
 A study conducted in the eastern state of Jharkhand in
 2007 showed that placental parasitaemia, measured by
 RDT or placental smear microscopy, ranged from 0.8%
 in urban areas to 3.6% in rural areas. However, it is esti-
 mated that 28.2 million pregnancies are at risk of Plas-
 modium falciparum (Pf) malaria annually in India, and
 thus even a low prevalence can translate into substantial
 mortality and morbidity. 8 Especially pregnant women
 from tribal populations and residents of forested hilly
 areas are known to be at higher risk of infection. 9 The
 current national policy in India for the control of MiP
 is to test pregnant women who present with symptoms
 or signs suggestive of malaria with a blood slide and to
 treat confirmed cases using quinine in the first trimester
 and artesunate (AS)+SP or artemether+lumefantrine in
 the second or third trimester. The use of a long-lasting
 insecticide-treated net (LLIN) during pregnancy is
 recommended in high-risk areas, but there is no specific
 distribution system for LLINs linked with antenatal care
 services. The effectiveness of the current policy of passive
 case detection (PCD) of MiP in low transmission settings
 is unknown. We hypothesised that ISTp would be more
 effective than PCD in detecting MiP and that effective
 treatment of infected individuals would reduce the risk
 of placental malaria and adverse birth outcomes. In this
 paper, we report a study that evaluated the effectiveness
 of ISTp delivered through the routine antenatal care
 system in a moderate-to-low transmission setting in India.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> This was a two-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial
 that compared ISTp versus the current policy of PCD
 for malaria during antenatal care visits. The primary
 endpoint of the trial was placental malaria and the
 secondary endpoints were low birth weight, adverse fetal
 birth outcomes and maternal anaemia. The unit of rando-
 misation was sub-health centres (SHC). Women were
 assigned to the ISTp arm or the PCD arm depending on
 the allocation of the SHC, where they attended ANC.
 
<section> Study area and population
 The study was conducted in Jharkhand state, India, in
 an area surrounded by forest, where malaria transmis-
 sion peaks during the rainy season from June to October.
 The study was implemented within the primary health-
 care delivery system in four subdistricts, two from Gumla
 district (Kamdara and Basia) and two from Simdega
 district (Bano and Kolebira). The population in each of
 the four subdistricts ranged from 63 775 to 80 10 Each
 subdistrict has one primary health centre (PHC) and
 several SHCs, those have at least one auxiliary midwife
 (ANM) who provides antenatal care. In Basia subdistrict,
 there is a government hospital and the St. Ursula mission
 hospital, which served as the study hospital. Delivery
 services are available in all PHCs and in approximately
 75% of SHCs. Emergency obstetric care, including
 caesarean section, is provided in the government and
 mission hospital in Basia.
 
<section> Sample size and randomisation
 During an observational study done in 2007, 4% of
 women attending ANC at St. Ursula mission hospital had
 peripheral malaria parasitaemia. 11 Assuming the risk of
 placental malaria would be higher than that of periph-
 eral parasitaemia, we expected that 7.5% of women in the
 PCD arm would have placental malaria, and we hypothe-
 sised that ISTp would reduce the risk of placental malaria
 by 25%. In order to detect a 25% reduction in the risk
 of placental malaria with 80% power, a two-sided alpha
 of 0.05 and a design effect of 1.25, the study needed
 clusters per arm and 100 women per cluster, total 6200
 women. Women attending an individual SHC for ante-
 natal care comprised a cluster. As there were 80 SHCs in
 the four study subdistricts and it was uncertain whether
 it would be possible to enrol 100 women per cluster in
 2 years, we randomised all 80 SHCs (40:40). We stratified
 the SHCs by subdistricts and then assigned numbers to
 randomise them to two groups.
 As the enrolment rate was slower than expected, and
 eight SHCs had to be closed due to security concerns,
 we replaced them with 15 maternal and children care
 centres (Anganwadi centres) in the subdistrict of Bano
 in July 2012.
 
<section> Trial procedures
 All staff who provided antenatal and delivery care in
 the study SHCs, PHCs and hospital, and the project
 field staff were trained to follow trial standard operating
 procedures and to complete study case record forms.
 All eligible pregnant women attending at an ANC at the
 study SHCs were enrolled in the study after informed
 consent had been obtained. Pregnant women of all pari-
 ties with a gestational age of 18–28 weeks were eligible for
 enrolment. Pregnant women with a chronic illness were
 excluded. All study participants were given free health
 and delivery services at the study hospital, PHCs or SHCs.
 At enrolment, women in both groups received routine
 antenatal care. A finger prick blood sample was taken
 for the assessment of haemoglobin (HemoCue, Angel-
 holm, Sweden) and for the collection of a filter paper
 sample. Syphilis and HIV testing were only done if part of
 routine ANC. In the ISTp group, all women had an RDT
 (SD Bioline Malaria Ag Pf/Pv (histidine-rich-protein
 (HRP-2)/plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH),
 www.​Standardia.​com)), a blood smear and filter paper
 sample (Whatman Grade 3 Chr) collected, irrespective
 of a history of fever, at each ANC attendance. In the
 PCD group, only women with a history of fever within

 RDT for malaria were treated with AS+SP according to
 the national treatment guidelines. The treatment was
 provided by the ANMs but was not supervised. Women
 in both groups were advised to attend ANCs regularly
 every month, and to attend a study health facility if they
 had any illness in between scheduled ANC visits. In both
 groups, if a woman presented with a history of fever in
 between scheduled ANC visits, they had an RDT done,

 blood slide and filter paper sample collected and, if the
 RDT was positive, they were treated with AS+SP.
 At delivery, birth outcomes, birth weight, and the
 Ballard score of the newborn were assessed, and blood
 samples for haemoglobin, microscopy and PCR were
 collected from both groups of women. A placental biopsy
 and blood smear were taken from all women who deliv-
 ered in the study hospital or had an institutional delivery
 within the study area. If a woman delivered at home, or
 in an institution other than the study health facilities,
 delivery outcomes were assessed ideally within 7 days
 of delivery. Study participants were followed once every
 2 months up to 6 months postpartum to assess the health
 status of the mother and her child. A verbal autopsy (VA)
 was done for all maternal deaths using the WHO 2016
 VA questionnaire 12 and the cause of death was assigned
 using the InterVA4 algorithm.
 
<section> Laboratory methods
 Blood slides were fixed and stained with Giemsa. All
 peripheral and placental blood slides were read twice
 by study laboratory technicians. For quality control of
 microscopy, experienced laboratory technicians from the
 National Institute of Malaria Research, Rourkela Field
 Station, re-read all slides reported positive by the study
 laboratory technicians and 50% of negative slides in year
 1, 30% in year 2 and 10% in year
 Placental biopsies (2.5×2.5×1 cm) were collected by
 ANMs at the time of delivery, stored in 10% buffered
 formalin containers and taken to the study hospital. On a
 weekly basis, the biopsies were taken to a private pathology
 laboratory in Ranchi where they were processed into
 paraffin tissue blocks. From each block, a set of two slides
 was prepared, one H&E and one Giemsa stained. The
 slides were read by two pathologists (SS and PB) based at
 the Ispat General Hospital, Rourkela, who were trained
 on-site by a malaria histopathology expert (AM) from the
 Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta. All histopatholog-
 ical slides were read by both pathologists and slides with
 discordant results were read again by both pathologists to
 reach a final diagnosis by consensus. The expert pathol-
 ogist read 100% of slides that were classified as placental
 malaria positive and 30% of slides classified as negative
 by the site pathologists. In case of discordant readings,
 the expert’s opinion was deemed to be the final reading.
 If malaria parasites were seen in the biopsy, it was classi-
 fied as active placental malaria. Active placental malaria
 was further classified as acute if there were no malaria
 pigments in fibrin and chronic if there were malaria
 pigments in fibrin. If there were no parasites, but there
 were malaria pigments in fibrin, the sample was classified
 as past placental malaria.
 Filter paper samples taken at enrolment and at delivery
 (peripheral and placental blood) were tested by PCR in
 a laboratory in Bangalore, India (Ecron Acunova). DNA
 extraction was done using the QIAamp Blood DNA Mini
 Extraction Kit from Qiagen. Real-time (RT) PCR assays,
 using the Taqman principle, were done with the Genome
 RT PCR Malaria Kit from Genome Diagnostics.
 
<section> Data management and analysis
 Data were double entered and verified using the EpiData
 V.3.1 software (​ www.​ epidata.​ dk). Data processing and
 analysis were done using the statistical software package
 STATA V.IC14.0.
 All women who were enrolled and for whom informa-
 tion on pregnancy outcomes was available were included
 in the analysis (intention-to-treat analysis). Principal
 components analysis was used to obtain a socioeconomic
 score based on household characteristics and assets. This

 was then divided into quintiles to create household socio-
 economic groups. Baseline characteristics at enrolment
 were summarised and compared between the ISTp and
 PCD groups.
 Pearson’s design-based test was used to compare
 the prevalence of RDT, blood slide and PCR-positive
 malaria across study arms. To account for clustering
 by village in primary outcomes, a logistic random
 effects model was used to compare the odds of each
 outcome in the ISTp versus PCD groups. A quadra-
 ture check was applied to the model postestimation to
 assess the reliability of the model. An estimate of the
 between-cluster SD was obtained for each outcome
 from the models and assessed using a likelihood
 ratio test. Women’s characteristics and measurements
 at enrolment were compared for women who had a
 biopsy and those who did not using Pearson’s design-
 based test.

<section> Results
 
<section> Study population
 Between April 2012 and September 2014, we enrolled
 3300 women in 46 clusters in the ISTp group and 3568
 women in 41 clusters in the PCD group (figure 1). The
 total number of clusters and women in the two groups
 differed as some SHCs had to be closed due to secu-
 rity concerns. The cluster size ranged from 6 to 224 in
 the ISTp group and from 10 to 264 in the PCD group
 (table 1). The median size of the clusters was, however,
 similar in the two groups (93 and 92 women per cluster
 in ISTp and PCD, respectively). The proportion of
 women who attended ANC visits 2 and 3 was overall low
 (61% and 35%) but even lower in the ISTp group than
 in the PCD group (54% vs 67% for visit 2 (p=0.01) and
 28% vs 42% for visit 3 (p=0.02)) (figure 1). However,
 the percentage of women who were seen at delivery was
 similar in each group (45%). Almost all women were seen
 at the final 6-month postpartum home visit (99.8%). The
 last delivery and postnatal follow-up took place in April
 and October 2015, respectively.
 There were no significant differences in the distribu-
 tion of age, gravidity, education, socioeconomic status
 and use of an ITN between the two trial groups (table 1).
 The proportion of women who reported a history of fever
 in the past 48 hours or temperature >37.5°C was slightly
 higher at enrolment in the ISTp group (8.5% vs 5.1%).
 The proportion of women who had received antimalarial
 treatment from the private sector at any time during their
 current pregnancy was high, 7.8% in the ISTp group and
 7.1% in the PCD group.
 
<section> Prevalence of malaria at enrolment
 At enrolment, 95.8% of women in the IST group were
 tested with an RDT and 3.2% were malaria positive; 2.7%
 had a Pf, 0.3% a P. vivax (Pv) and 0.3% a mixed infec-
 tion (Pf/Pv) (table 1). According to national policy, RDT
 testing was restricted to those who had symptoms sugges-
 tive of malaria in the PCD group and only 3% of women
 had an RDT done at enrolment; of those 6.5% were tested
 positive for Pf, 2% for Pv and 0.9% for a mixed infection
 (Pf/Pv). The proportion of women who were tested with
 PCR at enrolment was comparable between the groups
 (79.4% vs 75.8%) and the prevalence of PCR positive
 malaria did not differ between the two groups (5.9% vs
 4.2%, p=0.30) (table 1). Reasons for women having no
 PCR result at enrolment include that the sample was
 either not collected or that the dried blood spots were
 too small for the amount needed for DNA extraction.

 from the PCD group. The proportion of women with
 active or past placental malaria was lower than expected
 in the study cohort overall (5.0%, 152/3014). There was
 no statistically significant difference in the proportion
 of women with any placental malaria between the two
 groups (6% vs 4.2%) or the proportion of women with
 active (2.1% vs 1.7%) or past (2.4% vs 3.9%) placental
 malaria (table 2). The ORs of active and past placental
 malaria in the IST group compared with the PCD group
 were 1.03 (95% CI 0.51 to 2.10, p=0.93) and 1.54 (95%
 CI 0.88 to 2.68, p=0.12), respectively. There were 87 cases
 of placental malaria in the IST group (table 2). However,
 only 10 of these cases had a positive RDT anytime during
 the ANC visits. Thus, the sensitivity of the RDT to detect
 placental malaria was 11.5% (10/87).
 The risk of MiP varied substantially between clusters.
 The intracluster correlation coefficient for any placental
 malaria was 0.177 (95% CI 0.066 to 0.395). The number
 of placental malaria infections ranged from 0 to 9 per
 cluster; 29 clusters (14 ISTp and 15 PCD clusters) had no
 cases of placental malaria and five clusters had >7 cases of
 placental malaria (3 ISTp and 2 PCD clusters). However,
 the high and low placental malaria clusters were distrib-
 uted equally between the two groups.
 
<section> Secondary endpoints
 The proportions of women in the ISTp group tested with
 an RDT during ANC visits 2, 3 and 4 were 1663/1776
 (93.6%), 856/930 (92.3%) and 394/409 (96.3%),
 respectively, and among those tested, 2.2%, 2.1% and
 1.7%, respectively, were positive for malaria (table 3). In
 the PCD group, the proportions of women suspected to
 have malaria and tested with an RDT at ANC visits 2 and 3
 were 30/2391 (1.3 %) and 23/1507 (1.5%), respectively,
 and among those tested, 16.7% and 34.8%, respectively,
 were positive for malaria; no women had an RDT at the
 
<section> ANC visit
 The proportion of women who had RDT-positive
 malaria at least once during ANC and treated with
 AS+SP across all ANC visits was significantly higher in the
 ISTp arm 4.9% (163/3300) than in the PCD arm 0.6%
 (23/3568) (p<0.001).
 Of all women tested RDT positive, 71% (132/186) had
 Pf malaria, 19% (35/186) Pv malaria and 10% (19/186)
 a mixed infection (Pf/Pv).
 There was no statistically significant difference in low
 birth weight, preterm delivery, stillbirth or early neonatal
 death between the two groups (table 4).
 
<section> Safety endpoints
 There were 27 maternal deaths (death during preg-
 nancy, delivery or within 42 days of delivery); 12 in the
 ISTp group and 15 in the PCD group (table 5). There
 were four maternal deaths attributable to malaria (two
 in each group) determined by verbal autopsy. However,
 there were no cases of severe malaria admitted to the
 study hospital.

<section> Discussion
 
<section> ISTp detected more women with MiP compared with the
 current policy of PCD. However, ISTp did not reduce
 the risk of placental malaria or adverse birth outcomes
 compared with PCD. The possible reasons for ISTp not
 having an effect on placental malaria are: (i) only 28.2%
 of women were tested with an RDT at least three times
 during pregnancy in the IST group as they did not attend
 ANC frequently, (ii) the current generation of RDTs
 does not detect the majority of cases of placental malaria
 and (iii) a high proportion of women from both arms
 were treated with antimalarials from the private health
 sector. The most recent National Family Health Survey
 conducted in 2015–2016 reported that only 24.7% of
 mothers in rural Jharkhand had at least four ANC visits
 and 5.5% received full antenatal care, defined as mothers
 who had at least four ANC visits, one tetanus toxoid
 injection and at least 100 days of iron–folic acid tablets
 or syrup intake. 15 The strengthening of ANC services
 would improve the effectiveness of interventions deliv-
 ered as part of the existing ANC services and support
 the achievement of universal coverage. As part of ANC, a
 formal bed net distribution system for pregnant women
 and children would support the control of MiP. In our
 cohort, only 13.8% of pregnant women slept under an
 ITN the previous night.
 The sensitivity of RDTs in pregnancy is lower than in
 non-pregnant populations. 16 17 In our study, the observed
 sensitivity of RDTs to detect histology-confirmed
 placental malaria was 11.5%, similar to the sensitivity of
 10% reported from Indonesia 18 but lower to the sensi-
 tivity reported from Africa (73%, 95% CI 64 to 81).
 In low malaria transmission settings, where both symp-
 tomatic and asymptomatic patients should be identi-
 fied and treated, the conventional RDTs miss important
 proportions of infections. New combination, highly
 sensitive RDTs able to identify all infected individuals,
 will support countries implementing active case detec-
 tion strategies, 20 but their use and added benefit for
 malaria case management in pregnancy will need to be
 assessed. 21 The high maternal mortality ratio (437/100
 000) and perinatal mortality rate (39.3/1000) observed
 in the study cohort suggest that the risk factors for
 adverse birth outcomes in this community are multifac-
 torial, including a weak health system. Health systems
 challenges in Jharkhand also include insufficient access
 to care and potential treatment effects might be diluted
 by the high background rates of care seeking and treat-
 ment from the private sector. 22
 The prevalence of placental malaria in this study
 (4.2%) was lower than expected but is comparable to
 the prevalence of placental parasitaemia detected by
 impression smear (3.6%) in the study area in 2007.
 Placental biopsy samples were available from <50% of the
 study participants because it was not feasible to collect
 placental samples when a woman delivered at home, in a
 private health facility, in a facility outside the study area
 or had an abortion. However, there was no difference in
 the baseline characteristics between the women with and
 without placental biopsy samples (online supplemen-
 tary table 1). Thus, missing placental biopsy samples is
 unlikely to bias the comparison between the groups.
 In Africa, the proportion of women detected to have
 malaria by routine screening is much higher on first
 attendance at an ANC than on subsequent visits, 5 making
 single screening at first ANC attendance a potentially
 useful approach to malaria control. This was not the case
 in this study, where RDT-positive malaria ranged 2%–3%
 at all ANC visits. ISTp was shown to be inferior to IPTp
 with SP in several African settings. 6 However, in areas with
 perennial transmission and SP resistance, in east Africa, it
 was shown that IPTp-SP was superior to ISTp in reducing
 adverse birth outcomes.
 A cross-sectional survey of children aged <5 years in the
 study area in 2014 showed a malaria prevalence of 5.2%,
 6.4% and 8.5% by blood slide, RDT and PCR, respec-
 tively. Even though malaria transmission is very low in
 the study setting, the majority of women with MiP were
 asymptomatic, suggesting that PCD does not appropri-
 ately control MiP. RDT-positive malaria ranged 2%–3%
 at all ANC visits in this low transmission setting and ISTp
 implemented through the routine ANC system was able
 to detect more malaria cases compared with PCD. PCD
 misses detection of a significant proportion of pregnant
 women carrying parasite and screening as part of ANC
 could be a useful approach to detect and treat MiP.
 However, with the current generation of RDTs and low 
<section> attendance of repeat ANC visits, monthly ISTp is unlikely
 to have a major impact on the risk of placental malaria
 or adverse pregnancy outcomes relative to the existing
 
<section> strategy that relies largely on PCD.
 
<section> This study has several limitations: (i) the prevalence of
 MiP was lower than expected, (ii) the cluster sizes varied
 considerably and (iii) a large proportion of placental
 samples could not be collected. Despite these limitations,
 the results allow to conclude that intermittent screening
 and treatment during ANC is a useful approach to detect
 and treat MiP. Any potential ISTp screening strategy in
 India would need to consider the individual risk of Pf
 and/or Pv infection. Screening of pregnant women at
 their first ANC visit and re-testing only positive cases at
 subsequent visits would be a possible approach. Women
 tested positive are also more likely to return for repeat
 
<section> ANC visits. The feasibility and cost implications, espe-
 cially in combination with conventional or new highly
 sensitive RDTs, would, however, need to be assessed.
