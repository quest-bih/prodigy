<section> Abstract
 
<section> The aim of this study was to determine the effect of health education on the knowledge and attitude regarding
 family planning and contraception’s method among the women who obligatory attended the Premarital
 Counseling Center in Yasouj city, Iran. An experimental study was carried out and a total of 200 women were
 selected for the study using convenience sampling method among women who attended in the health centre in
 order to utilize the necessary premarital actions. Respondents were divided by two experimental and control
 groups randomly. A pre-evaluation was done on the knowledge and attitude on family planning using a
 structured questionnaire. After which, the health education for experimental group was done within four
 educational sessions during 4 consecutive weeks and control group underwent traditional education method.
 Post evaluation was utilized for any changes regarding their knowledge and attitude among the respondents
 immediately after the intervention. Independent and paired t-test was used to evaluate the mean knowledge and
 attitude scores differences among both groups. Results showed that there was a significant improvement in
 respondents’ knowledge and attitude after educational program in experimental group (p<0.001), while no
 significant difference was observed in knowledge and attitude of control group. The finding also indicated that
 age was significantly associated with the level of respondents’ knowledge. These results deal the effectiveness of
 the educational method. In conclusion, the educational method is effective in increasing the knowledge and
 improving the attitude of women regarding family planning in Yasouj compared to current used educational
 method. Future educational programs need to incorporate the features that have been associated with successful
 interventions in the past, as well as including their own evaluation procedures.

<section> 1. Introduction
 
<section> According to World health Organization (WHO) estimates, one in every five people in the world is an
 adolescent, (between 10 and 19 years of age). With an estimated 1.2 billion adolescents alive today, the world
 has the largest adolescent population in history (Blum and Nelson, 2005). Of these, about 85% or four out of five
 young people live in developing countries. Moreover, more than half of the world's population is below the age
 of 25 (UNFPA, 1998; WHO, 1999). Young people constitute a significant proportion of the Iranian population
 (Mohammadi et al., 2006). According to recent census (2006), there were approximately 17.6 million young 
<section> people aged 15–24, accounting for 25% of the Iranian population (Iran Statistic Center, 2007; Assad and Roudi-
 fahimi, 2007).
 
<section> Despite the fact that contraceptive usage has increased over a period of time, there exists a Knowledge Attitude
 and Practice -gap regarding contraception (Malek-Afzali, 1998; Ramesh et al., 1996). The reasons for not using
 any family planning methods are lack of knowledge and education, religious belief and fear of side effects.
 Family planning has two main objectives; firstly, to have only the desired number of children and secondly,
 proper spacing of pregnancies (Mao, 1999).
 
<section> Knowledge and practice of family planning is strongly related to higher level of education (Ramesh et al., 1996).
 In most of the studies it was found that education is the prime influencing factor and education affects the
 attitudinal and behavioral patterns of the individuals (Sajid and Malik, 2010; Mao, 1999). A number of
 Knowledge Attitude and Practice survey has been carried out covering different population groups (Dabral S,
 Malik, 2004; Gautam and Seth, 2001; Takkar et al., 2005; Rao, 2005). Based on a majority of researches, in
 most countries of the world, female adolescents do not receive formal reproductive health education on time,
 since their puberty happens earlier than boys. Lloyd (2009:85) contends that all 13–15 year olds should be
 acquiring “reading and writing fluency for lifelong learning, critical thinking skills, health and reproductive
 health knowledge and skills for social and civic participation. Nevertheless, it offers a standard to make informed
 and voluntary decisions in their lives, including their sexual, marital and reproductive lives. Studies have showed
 that 63.4% of puberty disorders and complications among females were because of their ignorance (Mohammadi
 et al., 2006). Considering the above research results and the fact that the number of youths in Iran is increasing,
 it is necessary to educate youths regarding family planning particularly during puberty and before marriage. This
 study tried to educate female adolescents who tended to married for the first time regarding family planning and
 find out how such education affects their knowledge and attitude.
 
<section> 2. Methods
 
<section> 2.1 Study area and Study Period
 
<section> The purpose of current study was to determine the effect of health education on the knowledge and attitude
 regarding family planning and contraception’s method among the women who obligatory attended the Premarital
 Counseling Center in Yasouj city, Iran. The study was conducted in Yasouj city located in the South-East of
 Iran, which is 800 km away from Tehran, the capital city of the country. The study was carried out in Shahid
 Ashrafi Isfahani Health Center. The center is a referral center which covered the only Premarital Counseling
 Center in the city. Iran has laws in place making premarital counseling and screening for Thalasaemia mandatory
 for all couples before they are given approval to get married. One innovative program provides mandatory
 premarital sex education courses for engaged couples form 1994. To obtain a marriage license, each couple must
 attend a short course on sexual and reproductive health issues, ranging from reproductive anatomy to spousal
 communication. The study was conducted from November 2010 to February 2011.
 
<section> 2.2 Study Design, Study Participants and Sampling
 
<section> An experimental design with an experimental and a control site using pre- and post-intervention measurements
 was used to investigate the effect of a planned family planning health education on the participants’ knowledge
 and attitude. The interventional education included in four 1.5 hours sessions covering related contents of
 contraception methods lectured by six health trainer. To ensure their consistency in educational methods and
 contents, they were trained seven consecutive days before starting intervention. Furthermore, the trainers also
 monitored directly using video camera recording which observed by researchers for assuring their consistency in
 educational methods and contents. The educational method consists of lecture and discussion panel including
 questions and answers concerning family planning and contraceptive methods which allow the women to express
 their ambiguity in understanding. Control group underwent traditional educational method which included a
 single two hours educational session which covering general issues of reproductive health issues consist of
 family planning, sexual health and spousal communication. Study population including all couples who wish to
 married and attended to premarital counselling centre during study period. There were 9534 couples who
 attended to the centre in 2010. A total of 200 women enrolled in the study using convenience sampling method.
 A convenience sampling method was used to select the study participants, because the application of any of the
 probability sampling methods would have obstructed the flow of service in the clinic and drastically increased
 clients’ waiting time. Afterward the selected samples randomly divided by two groups including control and
 experimental groups according to their registration numbers. The study flowchart illustrated in figure
 
<section> <Figure 1> 
<section> 2.3 Research Instruments
 
<section> Pre and post interventional data was gathered using a structured questionnaire which was developed based on
 previous studies on Family planning. It consisted of three parts: The first part of the questionnaire was
 demographic data. The second part of the questionnaire consisted of questions regarding knowledge on family
 planning and contraception’ methods and the third part comprised of questions regarding attitude toward family
 planning on both positive and negative statements regarding common issues on family planning with 5 point
 Likert Scale questions. The knowledge and attitude questions have shown in Table 1 and 2. Content validity was
 ascertained by an expert panel comprising professionals who were health faculty members, health practitioners
 and family physicians. Pilot study was carried out on 30 women not included in the study. It was performed as
 an initial step for the study to check the questionnaire. Some modifications in some questions were done after the
 pilot study. Its reliability also was determined by alpha-Krunbach (r=0.76) considering the fact that A reliability
 coefficient (alpha) of .70 or higher is considered acceptable reliability (Wells and Wollack, 2003).
 
<section> 2.4 Study Procedure
 
<section> After receiving a verbal consent from respondents, pre – interventional assessment was done using the structured
 questionnaire measuring the respondent’s knowledge and attitude regarding family planning written in Persian.
 The questionnaire took about 20 minutes to be completed. In order to start study, the experimental group was
 divided by four equal groups (each group 25 person) who underwent four educational sessions during
 consecutive weeks. The health education was done by the health trainers which lasted approximately 1.5 hours.
 Visual aids were used to further guide the respondents during the sessions. Questions were encouraged and a
 discussion after the lecture followed. Topics discussed during the family planning lecture were the different
 methods of family planning, its proper use, side effects, advantages and disadvantages. Issues regarding family
 planning in general were also addressed. These include side effects that one may expect from each method, the
 fear that some methods can lead to cancer and the complaints regarding the effectiveness of the methods. Some
 concerns were also regarding the approval of their husbands since some regard family planning as affecting the
 masculinity of their husbands. Explaining the long –term benefits of family planning on their family’s health and
 finances was also a goal in the discussions. Furthermore, the traditional education method was done among
 control group. The knowledge and attitude regarding family planning were assessed immediately after the
 intervention.
 
<section> 2.5 Ethical Considerations
 
<section> Women were informed of the purpose of the study. It was emphasized that the study was an attempt to improve
 knowledge and attitude about family planning and contraception methods. Permission to carry out the study was
 obtained from District Health Center Ethics Committee and Shahid Ashrafi Isfahani Health Center authorities.
 Questionnaires were assigned unique codes and the results of each individual questionnaire were kept in strict
 confidence.
 
<section> 2.6 Statistical Analysis
 
<section> Data were entered and analyzed using the Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16. Each
 knowledge question was scored 0 for an incorrect response and 1 for a correct response. A summary score was
 calculated for each subjects’ responses at the pre and Post-intervention data. Each attitude question was scored
 from 0 to 2. An independent t-test was used to test the differences between the mean scores among groups at the
 pre-intervention as well as the post-intervention education. Mean scores for experimental group were compared
 to mean scores for control group. The paired t-test was used to compare the changes in scores from pre- to
 post-intervention in both groups. The criterion for statistical significance was set at 0.05.
 
<section> 3. Results
 
<section> Demographic and socio-economic information of study adolescents are shown in Table 3. The mean age of
 subjects was 23.27 (SD=3.96.6). Majority of either experimental or control groups were housewife (97.9 and
 93.9 percent respectively) and also most of the respondents’ spouse occupation in both groups worked in private
 sectors (66 and 60 percent in experimental and control groups respectively). Most of the respondents in
 experimental group (41.2%) as well as control group (40.4%) have completed high school. Almost of the
 subjects’ husbands were working in private sector (48.5% and 52.1% in experimental and control group
 respectively).
 
<section> There were no significant differences in age, occupation and educational level between two groups. There was a
 significant (p<0.001) improvement in the level of knowledge regarding family planning among experimental
 group (enhancement from 3.97±4.04 to 9.67±3.15), while there was no significant difference among control 
<section> group knowledge. Similarly, the attitude of control group significantly (P<0.001) differed from baseline to end
 line (4.20±3.20 to 9.73±22.40) which was not significant in control group The results also indicated a significant
 differences between groups in case of knowledge and attitude after intervention while these level were not
 different after intervention (Table 4).
 
<section> These results deal the effectiveness of the educational method. The finding also indicated that age was
 significantly associated with the level of respondents’ knowledge, on the other word with increasing the age, the
 knowledge will increase regarding family planning.
 
<section> 4. Discussion
 
<section> The result demonstrated the poor knowledge and attitude regarding family planning among respondents which
 was in agreement with the study in the South-East Asia that showed low level of contraception methods
 information (Dabral and Malik, 2004). Lack of knowledge about contraceptive methods can be a major obstacle
 in their use (Sajid and Malik, 2010).
 
<section> The research findings also showed that the mean scores of respondents’ differed significantly before and after
 intervention among experimental group and mean change of knowledge were about 5.70, while the knowledge
 score of control group were not significantly different compare to the baseline. It is indicated that family
 planning education through this method had an impact on improving respondents’ knowledge. On the other word
 the traditional educational method which used currently is not effective as present method of education. Other
 studies also proved that health education regarding reproductive health not only increased the respondents’
 knowledge, but also improved their healthy behavior (Afghari et al., 2008; Eisenstein et al., 2000; Meuwissen et
 al., 2006).
 
<section> The results of the present study revealed that family planning education improved the experimental subjects’
 attitude about contraception methods significantly. This may signify that any improvement in a person’s
 knowledge about something will ensue to a better attitude on it. However, the increase in the mean scores from
 4.20 during the pretest to 9.73 during the post proves that family planning education can be a useful tool not just
 in improving a person’s knowledge but their attitude as well. This is consistent with the results of Wang and his
 colleagues (2011).Through the health education on family planning, negative attitude on family planning will be
 changed since promoting a more positive attitude on family planning is a vital step in the actual acceptance of
 family planning method by people.
 
<section> The finding also demonstrated that continues education had higher impact on attitude improvement rather than
 usual educational method which present in a single session of lecture. Young (1996) believes that health
 education for adolescents strongly affects their attitude toward their abilities and suggests that education should
 be long term enough to develop their attitude. Poppe (1992) also showed that educational films improve the
 adolescents’ attitude toward adolescents’ relationships and their knowledge about various safe sexual behaviors.
 
<section> 5. Conclusion
 
<section> Based on this study, health education is an effective way of increasing the Knowledge and Attitude regarding
 family planning among the women who attended the premarital counseling center in Yasouj. Although current
 study showed effectiveness of the educational method, but more efforts are needed to change current educational
 method to be more effective and attractive for couples.
