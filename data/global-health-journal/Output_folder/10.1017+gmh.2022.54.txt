<section> Results. Sixty participants received ST and 60 received T + P. Implementation costs (ST = $329,
 T + P = $617) were substantially higher than service delivery costs (ST = $18.7, T + P = $22.4)
 per participant. ST and T + P participants accrued 46.5 and 49.4 QALYs, respectively. The
 ICERs for T + P relative to ST were $4422 per QALY gained (95% confidence interval: $2484
 to $9550) – slightly above the highly cost-effective threshold – and −$53.21 (95% confidence
 interval: −$105.8 to −$30.2) per unit change on the Patient Health Questionnaire.
 
<section> Conclusion. Providing HAP within integrated depression services in Chitwan was cost-effective,
 if not highly cost-effective. Efforts to scale up integrated services in Nepal and similar contexts
 should consider including evidence-based psychological interventions as a part of cost-effective
 mental healthcare for depression.
 
<section> Introduction
 
<section> One in 27 people with depression receives minimally adequate mental healthcare in low- and
 lower-middle-income countries, compared to one in five in high-income countries
 (Thornicroft et al., 2017). Mental health accounts for less than two percent of total health
 spending in low- and lower-middle-income countries, despite depression alone being the
 second leading contributor to global disability (Patel et al., 2018; Vigo et al., 2019; GBD
 2019 Mental Disorders Collaborators, 2022). Integrating mental health services into primary
 care and other service delivery platforms has been recognized and implemented as a key strat-
 egy for reducing the gap between burden and available mental healthcare in low- and
 middle-income countries (LMIC) (Collins et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2018; Kola et al., 2021).

<section> is properly cited. Since then, these guidelines have been implemented as part of mental health and psychosocial
 support services in more than 90 countries (Keynejad et al., 2018). Evidence for mhGAP is
 part of a wider, robust evidence base developed over the past two decades on the effectiveness
 of task sharing interventions to improve a range of mental health conditions (van Ginneken
 et al., 2011; Singla et al., 2017; Hoeft et al., 2018; Karyotaki et al., 2022). 
<section> Task sharing and service integration approaches are based on
 the premise these models represent a more efficient, cost-effective
 allocation of limited resources compared to traditional models of
 centralized, specialist service delivery (Beaglehole et al., 2008).
 Despite this, there is a dearth of economic evidence supporting
 the use of these models to treat depression (Herrman et al.,
 2022) and other mental health disorders (Knapp and Wong,
 2020). A 2020 systematic review by Cubillos and colleagues
 (2020) found strong evidence integrating mental health services
 into primary care is effective for reducing clinical symptoms
 and functional impairment of depression within LMIC.
 However, the authors identified only seven studies examining
 the cost-effectiveness of integrated services for treating depres-
 sion, with three of these studies relying on modeling rather
 than experimental data.
 Experimental data are necessary to build the economic evi-
 dence base, test integration assumptions, and establish standar-
 dized frameworks to guide economic research within global
 mental health (Cubillos et al., 2020). Economic evaluations
 based on prospective studies also provide valuable opportunities
 to cost resources required to implement mental health interven-
 tions. Implementation costs are often underestimated within pub-
 lic health research and can qualitatively affect the results of
 economic evaluation (Sohn et al., 2020). Incomplete cost data
 may stem from economic evaluations conducted post hoc where
 important cost drivers are not captured, resource requirements
 are underestimated, and other limitations arise common to retro-
 spective data collection (Sohn et al., 2020). Some underestimated
 costs may also be a result of training approach. Researchers imple-
 menting global mental health interventions often rely on inter-
 national experts to provide in-person training and
 oversee service implementation (Fairburn and Patel, 2014).
 These approaches can result in service delivery models that are
 not sustainable or scalable, particularly if these implementation
 costs are not accurately incorporated into economic evaluations.
 Accurate and comprehensive cost profiles are necessary to inform
 health officials and other decision-makers when integrating and
 scaling up of mental health services within primary care systems.
 We used prospective data to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a
 psychological intervention within a package of treatment for
 depression from one of the largest mhGAP-based studies within
 LMIC, the Programme for Improving Mental Health Care
 
<section> (PRIME) (Lund et al., 2012). In Nepal, the PRIME consortium
 implemented a district mental healthcare plan in the district
 of Chitwan during the implementation phase from 2013 to
 
<section> 2017 (Lund et al., 2012; Jordans et al., 2016, 2019b). To expand
 access to mental health care at the health facility level, primary
 care workers were trained to identify and deliver mental health
 services for depression and other priority mental disorders
 according to clinical decision-making guidelines in the mhGAP
 Intervention Guide (World Health Organization, 2014).
 PRIME researchers imbedded a randomized control trial within
 a cohort study of these services to evaluate the effectiveness of
 two packages of mhGAP-based care for people with depression:
 a standard package of psychoeducation, antidepressant medica-
 tion when indicated, and home-based follow up, versus this pack-
 age plus the Healthy Activity Programme (HAP), a behavioral
 activation based psychological intervention (Jordans et al., 2019a).
 Evidence from the nested randomized trial indicated that,
 while clinical and functional outcomes improved for all service
 users with depression over time (Jordans et al., 2019b), the
 psychological intervention was likely the key determinant in
 treatment effectiveness (Jordans et al., 2019a, 2020a). People
 with depression who received services without HAP did not
 have significantly greater improvements in clinical or functional
 outcomes compared to individuals with subclinical depression
 who received care as usual (Jordans et al., 2020a). These findings
 align with evidence indicating psychological interventions are
 effective in LMIC (Cuijpers et al., 2018; Karyotaki et al., 2022)
 and may have more enduring effects than antidepressants alone
 for people with depression (Cuijpers et al., 2013). Despite this,
 there is evidence primary care providers in Nepal prefer pharma-
 cotherapy to psychological or psychosocial interventions when
 treating depression (Bhardwaj et al., 2022).
 Existing cost estimates for PRIME depression services rely on
 modeling studies or research in other contexts and have yet to be
 updated with empirical estimates from PRIME services. Prior to
 service implementation, Chisholm and colleagues projected the
 cost-per-case of treating depression within primary care facilities
 in Nepal to be $1.86 for basic psychoeducation, advice, and follow
 up; $29.63 for antidepressant medication; and $2.32 for individual
 psychosocial counseling in 2008 USD (Chisholm et al., 2016).
 Cost estimates for HAP differ considerably from similar research
 in Goa, India, where delivering HAP within primary care cost an
 average of $65.66 per service user in 2015 international dollars
 ($19.69 in 2015 USD) (Weobong et al., 2017; World Bank,
 2022). Chisholm and colleagues (2016) also estimated per-capita
 spending for scaled-up services by multiplying absolute preva-
 lence by coverage by per-case costs, resulting in a cost-per-capita
 of $0.67 per capita at 15% national coverage levels. Related
 research indicated per-capita spending on mental health would
 need increase to $1.27 for mhGAP-based services to meet
 national coverage targets (Chisholm et al., 2017). However,
 these estimates are based on projectd costs, focus on service deliv-
 ery alone, and lack valuable information on implementation costs
 relevant to health decision-makers.
 Using prospective trial data, our primary objective was to
 evaluate the cost-effectiveness of providing psychological inter-
 vention within a package of depression services delivered by pri-
 mary care workers in Chitwan, Nepal. A secondary objective was
 to construct a cost profile of service implementation and delivery
 for the two service packages included in the trial. Given psycho-
 logical intervention may be the key to effective care for depression
 in this context, our goal was to produce economic evidence on the
 value of including this intervention within mhGAP-based service
 models and ultimately inform efforts in Nepal and similar con-
 texts to scale up integrated mental health services.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Design
 
<section> Research assistants recruited trial participants by screening eli-
 gible service users at ten participating primary care facilities in
 Chitwan, Nepal. Eligibility criteria required participants be
 or older (the majority age in Nepal), reside in the study area,
 speak Nepali, be willing and able to provide informed consent,
 and not already be receiving treatment for depression or other
 mental health conditions. After confirming eligibility, research
 assistants then administered the nine-item Patient Health
 Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (Kroenke et al., 2001) adapted and vali-
 dated for use in Nepal (Kohrt et al., 2016). Female Community
 Volunteers also identified and referred individuals from the sur-
 rounding catchment areas to PRIME facilities for depression 
<section> screening using a proactive community case detection tool (Subba
 et al., 2017), which has been found to increase help-seeking
 behavior for depression and other mental health disorders
 (Jordans et al., 2020c). Individuals who screened positive on the
 PHQ-9 or who were referred by community health workers
 received a clinical diagnostic interview by a trained primary care
 provider. Primary care providers also identified some individuals
 with depression during routine consultations who were not
 screened positive by research assistant or referred
 by community volunteers. Individuals diagnosed with depression
 during clinical interview were invited to participate in the rando-
 mized control trial. Research assistants collected sociodemo-
 graphic information at baseline and administered a series of
 questionnaires at baseline and three- and twelve-month follow
 up. Further information on study design, PRIME, and program
 impact in Nepal are available elsewhere (Baron et al., 2018;
 Jordans et al., 2019a, 2019b, 2020b; Aldridge et al., 2020).
 
<section> Setting
 
<section> PRIME researchers trained primary care providers at 10 primary
 care facilities in Chitwan, Nepal on the identification, manage-
 ment, and follow up of depression and three other priority mental
 disorders – alcohol use disorder, psychosis, and epilepsy – accord-
 ing to the mhGAP Intervention Guide (Lund et al., 2012; World
 Health Organization, 2014). Primary care providers then deliv-
 ered mental healthcare at the 10 participating primary care facil-
 ities from 2014 to 2017, with some training and research
 coordination beginning in 2013. Prior to PRIME, mental health
 services were only available at regional hospitals and some private
 facilities in Chitwan. Five percent of community members in a
 representative survey conducted by PRIME researchers screened
 positive prior to program implementation, though less than one
 in ten who screened positive for depression had received treat-
 ment for depression the past 12 months (Luitel et al., 2017).
 
<section> Interventions
 
<section> Eligible participants diagnosed with depression were enrolled into
 a randomized control trial comparing two packages of integrated
 services: standard treatment (ST), which followed the mhGAP
 Intervention Guide in recommending psychoeducation, psycho-
 social advice, follow up, and antidepressant medication when
 indicated, or standard treatment plus psychological intervention
 (T + P) (Jordans et al., 2019a). Individuals in the T + P group
 received HAP, a manualized psychological intervention delivered
 at primary care facilities over six to eight weekly sessions. HAP
 was initially developed in India using culturally-adapted elements
 of evidence-based mental health treatment approaches and has
 been demonstrated to be clinically and cost-effective for indivi-
 duals with moderate to severe depression when delivered by pri-
 mary care providers in India (Chowdhary et al., 2016; Patel et al.,
 
<section> 2017; Weobong et al., 2017; Bhat et al., 2022). The intervention is
 primarily based on behavioral activation therapy and includes ele-
 ments of behavioral assessment, problem solving, activating social
 networks, and activity structuring and scheduling. Sessions are
 categorized into three phases intended to orient the individual,
 deliver components, and sustain skills after treatment, with the
 treatment goals of improved mood, improved life context, and
 reduced life problems (Chowdhary et al., 2016).
 
<section> Health effects
 
<section> We used quality adjust life years (QALYs) as the primary measure
 of health effect in our cost-utility analysis. To estimate QALYs, we
 relied on methods by Lokkerbol et al. (2021) in which sociodemo-
 graphic factors and eight items from the 12-item WHO Disability
 Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) (Üstün, 2010) are regressed
 onto a preference-weighted disability index created using a
 nationally representative survey from 14 countries (Üstün et al.,
 2003). Both a general and population-specific mapping functions
 are available within their methods. We chose the mapping func-
 tion representative of an Indian population as most relevant to
 our study population in Nepal (Lokkerbol et al., 2021). An equa-
 tion in the supplement indicates the weight placed on each
 WHODAS and sociodemographic item used to generate the dis-
 ability index (online Supplementary Equation S1). The WHODAS
 has been adapted, validated, and used widely for mental health
 research in Nepal (Tol et al., 2007; Luitel et al., 2013; Bimali
 et al., 2018; Risal et al., 2021), though the disability mapping
 method has not been validated against other measures of health
 utility.
 The method to estimate QALYs from the WHODAS builds on
 previous methods used in South Asia (Buttorff et al., 2012) and in
 other LMIC (McBain et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2017). Health status
 is calculated as one minus the resulting disability index; a health
 status of one represents full health and 0 represents death. QALYs
 are then calculated by plotting health status over time and meas-
 uring the area under the curve (Yeo et al., 2019). Given the
 12-month study follow up, participants could have gained up to
 one QALY during the trial. Our secondary measure of health
 effects relied on PHQ-9 scores as a measure of depression
 symptoms within cost-effectiveness analysis (Kroenke et al.,
 2001).
 Research assistants administered the WHODAS and PHQ-9 to
 participants at all three study timepoints: baseline, 3 months, and
 12-months. The WHODAS is comprised of 12 items where
 respondents are asked to report functioning in the previous two
 weeks across six domains – cognition, mobility, self-care, social
 interactions, life activities, and participation – using a Likert
 response ranging from 0 (‘none’) to 4 (‘extreme’) (Üstün, 2010).
 The PHQ-9 is a common measure of depression symptoms
 where respondents report the frequency of depressive symptoms
 
<section> (0 ‘Not at all’, 1 ‘Several days’, 2 ‘More than half the days’,
 
<section> ‘Nearly every day’) over the previous two weeks on nine items
 (Kroenke et al., 2001). PHQ-9 responses are summed to produce
 a measure of symptom severity ranging from 0 to 27. Previous
 validation research has found a cutoff score of 10 to be indicative
 of depression in Chitwan with 94% sensitivity and 80% specificity
 and an internal consistency of α = 0.84 (Kohrt et al., 2016).
 
<section> Costs
 
<section> Implementation costs for provider training and supervision were
 abstracted from PRIME administrative data and allocated accord-
 ing to resource use for each intervention under a five-year time
 horizon. Physical and mental health service delivery costs were
 calculated by multiplying healthcare use, reported by participants
 using the Client Socio-Demographic and Service Receipt
 Inventory (Chisholm et al., 2000) (online Supplementary Table
 S4), with the unit costs of healthcare resources (Stenberg et al.,
 2018) (online Supplementary Table S5). A detailed analysis of dif-
 ferences in healthcare use and costs across study groups are

 presented in a forthcoming paper. All cost data are reported in
 2020 international dollars for the year 2020 from the societal per-
 spective. Additional details of costing methods are presented in
 the supplementary materials.
 
<section> Cost-effectiveness analysis
 We compared the total cost of providing each treatment with the
 total health effects accrued by participants in each treatment
 group in our economic evaluation (Drummond et al., 2015).
 Our primary measure of cost-effectiveness is the incremental cost-
 effectiveness ratio (ICER), estimated by dividing the incremental
 cost of T + P over the incremental health effects of T + P relative
 to ST. We also present a secondary ICER based the incremental
 change in PHQ-9 scores as the measure of health effect. In add-
 ition to the program total approach to cost-effectiveness analysis
 presented in the main text, we also present an average approach to
 calculating ICERs in the supplementary materials that relies on
 the difference in median per-participant costs compared with dif-
 ference in mean health effects per participant (online
 Supplementary Methods). Missing data for all costs and health
 effects were imputed using the multiple imputation chained equa-
 tion (i.e. ‘mice’) package in R with predictive mean matching and
 20 imputations.
 Lastly, we used nonparametric bootstrapping methods to esti-
 mate a 95% confidence interval around the resulting sample-
 based ICER (Sanders et al., 2016). The method involved generat-
 ing 1000 bootstrapped replicates by sampling from study partici-
 pants within each group with replacement, calculating the
 difference in costs and health effects for each replicate, and then
 taking the middle 95th percentile of the resulting ICER replicates
 (online Supplementary Equation S2). A notable advantage of this
 method is that it maintains the association between each partici-
 pant’s costs and health effects within the repeated sampling
 frame. We then plotted the ICER replicates and calculated the
 percentage of replicates under one- and three-times 2020 gross
 domestic product (GDP) per capita in Nepal, which represent his-
 torical thresholds for highly cost-effective and cost-effective inter-
 ventions, respectively (Word Health Organization, 2001). Despite
 the limitations of thresholds based on GDP (Marseille et al., 2015;
 Bertram et al., 2016), we present these thresholds to promote
 comparability with existing economic evaluations and because
 established thresholds for Nepal are under debate. We also pre-
 sent a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve in the supplementary
 materials that indicates the likelihood T + P is cost-effective across
 a range of thresholds (online Supplementary Figure S3).
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> One-hundred twenty people diagnosed by primary care workers
 with depression were enrolled and randomized to receive ST (n =
 60) or T + P (n = 60). At baseline, average participant age was
 43.5 (standard deviation = 13.4) among ST and 39.0 among T + P
 (standard deviation = 14.1). Most participant were female (ST =
 88%, T + P = 82%), had a partner (ST = 88%, T + P = 75%), and
 were Hindu (ST = 85%, T + P = 85%) (Table 1). A larger proportion
 of participants in the T + P group had completed primary school or
 more (53%) compared to those in the ST group (28%). Nine (15%)
 ST participants and 14 (23%) T + P participants were lost to follow
 up throughout the trial, including eight participants who did not
 participate in any HAP sessions (online Supplementary Fig. S1).
 
<section> T + P participants completed an average of 3.8 (standard deviation
 = 2.0) sessions over study follow up, with 60% completing between
 three and five sessions. Missing data for those lost to follow up and
 one cost outlier were multiply imputed and included in the
 analysis.
 
<section> Healthcare costs
 
<section> Training and supervision activities took place at primary care
 facilities and in the community throughout the PRIME Nepal
 implementation phase. PRIME relied on both primary care provi-
 ders and community health workers to deliver mental health ser-
 vices. Primary care workers, including adjunct counselors trained
 through PRIME, provided most mental healthcare received by
 service users. Community health workers conducted home-based
 visits to encourage treatment attendance and follow up among
 service users. Trainings in each setting often involved a mix of
 both health worker cadres. Total training and supervision costs
 per service user totaled to $329 and $617 for ST and T + P,
 respectively (Table 2). Costs for delivering mental and physical
 health services were substantially lower than implementation
 costs. Median mental health service delivery costs were slightly
 higher among T + P participants, while the median cost of phys-
 ical healthcare among ST participants, which includes services
 provided by traditional and indigenous healers, was more than
 double that of T + P participants (Table 2). A detailed investiga-
 tion of differences in health service use and costs are presented
 in a forthcoming paper.

<section> Health effects
 
<section> There were no significant differences between trial groups in health
 status ( p = 0.21) or depression symptoms (p = 0.69) at baseline.
 Over 12-month follow up, ST participants gained a total of 46.5
 QALYs and T + P participants gained 49.4, averaging 0.776 and
 0.825 QALYs gained per participant for ST and T + P, respectively
 (Fig. 1, Table 2). Total depression symptom scores decreased (indi-
 cating improvement) by 332.2 points among ST participants and
 576.0 among T + P from baseline to 12-month follow up, with
 an average change score per client of −5.54 (standard error =
 0.77) for ST and −9.60 (standard error = 0.59) for T + P.
 
<section> Cost effectiveness
 
<section> We combined total program costs for each treatment group with
 total health effects to estimate cost-effectiveness (Table 3). T + P
 cost $12973 more than ST, with 2.93 more QALYs gained and
 a 243.8-point greater decrease in depression scores among parti-
 cipants. This resulted in an ICER for T + P relative to ST of
 $4422 per QALY gained, which is slightly above the per capita
 GDP threshold of $4009 for being considered highly cost-effective
 and well under the cost-effectiveness threshold of three times per
 capita GDP. The ICER for changes in depression symptoms, our
 secondary measure of health effect, was $53.2 per point decrease
 on the PHQ-9. The per-client approach and a comparison of
 results for the total and per-client methods are presented in the
 supplement (online Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
 Nonparametric uncertainty analysis resulted in a 95% confidence
 interval of $2484 to $9550 per QALY gained. Approximately 37%
 and 99% of bootstrapped iterations were under the thresholds of
 one and three times gross domestic product per capita, respectively
 (Fig. 2). Uncertainty analysis for the secondary ICER resulted in a
 95% confidence interval of −$105.8 to −$30.2 per unit change on
 the PHQ-9.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of providing a psycho-
 logical intervention as part of primary-care-based services for
 people with depression in Chitwan, Nepal. Data for this study
 are from a randomized trial nested within PRIME between 2013
 another without. We found the cost-effectiveness of T + P to be
 $4422 per QALY gained in 2020 international dollars, well
 below the cost-effective threshold of three times per-capita GDP
 and slightly above the per capita GDP threshold for being highly
 cost-effective. Nonparametric uncertainty analysis indicated a
 very strong likelihood the ICER is below the cost-effective thresh-
 old, though a low likelihood it is below the highly cost-effective
 threshold. The findings and limitations of our study are consid-
 ered within context of economic evaluation research in global
 mental health, including notable methodological approaches,
 before implications for practice and policy are presented.
 A strength of our study is the prospective costing of implemen-
 tation within cost-effectiveness analysis. Implementation costs are
 often underestimated during economic evaluations of public
 health interventions and can qualitatively affect research findings
 (Sohn et al., 2020). These costs, defined here as the economic
 value of resources used for provider training and supervision
 per client, were over ten times the cost of direct service delivery
 of PRIME services for depression. Though service delivery costs
 were similar to those projected during planning (Chisholm
 et al., 2016), failing to account for the cost of resources linked
 to their implementation would have substantively limited our
 understanding of the cost and value of both service packages.
 Implementation costs should be a key target when considering
 how to improve program efficiency.
 A second strength is our use of novel methods to estimate indi-
 vidual health utility at each time point, rather than applying broad
 categories of generic disability weights for depression developed
 in other contexts. Methods published by Lokkerbol et al. (2021)
 enabled us to use sociodemographic factors and WHODAS

 health and functioning (e.g., Habtamu et al., 2017). Notably, aver-
 age baseline disability derived from WHODAS mapping is lower
 than the generic disability weight used by the Global Burden of
 Disease Studies for a moderate depressive episode (Global
 Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2020). In the absence
 of valid, sensitive quality of life measures appropriate for LMIC,
 deriving QALYs from WHODAS provides an opportunity to
 strengthen and standardize methodological approaches to eco-
 nomic evaluation within global mental health.
 Our study is limited by the lack of established cost-effectiveness
 thresholds in Nepal. We refer to ‘historical’ cost-effectiveness
 thresholds based on per capita GDP initially developed by WHO
 (2001), which have been critiqued for their limited applicability
 to public health (Marseille et al., 2015; Bertram et al., 2016).
 More recent research has varied considerably in producing newer
 thresholds. Stenberg et al. (2014) estimate a threshold 1.5 to
 2.0 times per capita GDP for low-income countries based on a
 review of evidence for the value of statistical life years. Woods
 et al. (2016) developed a threshold range of $109 to $1756 for
 Nepal, less than half of per capita GDP at its upper limit.
 Ochalek et al. (2018) estimated a threshold range of $256 to
 $291 for Nepal, approximately 6% of per capita GDP. We present
 our results according to the most commonly used, while flawed,
 cost-effectiveness thresholds from the WHO while also providing
 a supplemental figure (online Supplementary Fig. S3) to indicate
 the likelihood of cost-effectiveness across a range of alternate
 thresholds.
 
<section> Our study is also somewhat limited in the scope of the societal
 perspective chosen for cost-effectiveness analysis. We account for
 all formal and informal healthcare costs in the societal perspec-
 tive, such as transportation fees and the value of service user
 time (Sanders et al., 2016). However, we did not account for
 potential differences in the value of non-health related benefits.
 As such, there may be relevant differences in productivity, use
 of social services, or other non-health benefits not captured in
 our costing approach. Moreover, we present only the societal per-
 spective comprised of formal and informal healthcare costs and
 do present the healthcare sector or payer perspectives. Given
 the vast majority of costs were incurred for training and supervi-
 sion within the formal health system, it is highly unlikely adopting
 a more narrow perspective of the healthcare sector or payer would
 qualitatively affect our findings.
 Our results align with similar research on HAP delivered
 within primary care in Goa, India. An economic evaluation of
 HAP in Goa, where the program was first developed, resulted
 in an ICER of $9333 per QALY gained compared to usual care,
 or roughly 60% of the state’s per capita GDP but above national
 per capita GDP (Patel et al., 2017; Weobong et al., 2017).
 Recent research supports the long-term effectiveness and cost-
 effectiveness of HAP in India at five-year follow up (Bhat et al.,
 2022). A similar trial in Goa found collaborative stepped care
 compared to usual care for common mental disorders in primary
 care to be more costly in private facilities, cost saving in public
 facilities, and slightly more effective in both facility types
 (Buttorff et al., 2012). Overall, our findings generally align with
 the small evidence base for the cost-effectiveness of integrated ser-
 vices for depression in primary care within LMIC (Cubillos et al.,
 2020). A distinction of the present study is our inclusion of an
 active comparison group rather than comparing to usual care.
 Usual care, even ‘enhanced’ usual care, within mental health stud-
 ies in LMIC typically means little to no actual treatment for
 depression is provided. Our findings indicate including a psycho-
 logical intervention is cost-effective above and beyond active treat-
 ment delivered according to mhGAP guidelines.
 The Ministry of Health in Nepal has adopted plans to scale up
 a model of services for priority mental disorders based on the evi-
 dence established by PRIME (Luitel et al., 2020). Future research
 should examine how the cost-effectiveness of the psychological
 intervention may change based on their model at scale. High
 implementation costs observed in the present trial will likely be
 reduced given economies of scale and changes to implementation
 strategies by the ministry, such as changes to who provides treat-
 ment, who conducts trainings, and the number of providers in
 each training cohort. Future research should also consider the
 equity of health and financial benefits conferred by integrated ser-
 vices for depression, as the present study was not sufficiently pow-
 ered for subgroup analysis across key socioeconomic factors. 
<section> Lastly, methods for economic research within global mental
 health should be standardized to improve the comparability and
 utility of findings. This includes building consensus for cost-
 effectiveness thresholds reflecting the willingness to pay for health
 spending in Nepal, rather than applying a generic GDP-based
 approach to all LMIC. Health utility measurement should also
 be standardized within mental health research given debate on
 the sensitivity of popular quality of life measures for mental
 health (Connell et al., 2014; Mukuria et al., 2016), and we support
 the use of WHODAS to estimate individual health utility rather
 than applying generic disability weights in the interim.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> Providing HAP is cost-effective within primary care services for
 depression in Chitwan, Nepal. Combined with previous evidence
 indicating psychological intervention is likely central to clinical
 and functional effectiveness, our findings provide further evidence
 that evidence-based psychological intervention should be
 included when integrating and scaling up services for depression
 in Nepal and similar contexts.
