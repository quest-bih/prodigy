 antitoxin is recommended for the treatment of tetanus, largely
 based on historical estimates of allergic reactions to equine
 antitoxin (estimated incidence of 2–50%). Only one trial
 comparing the human with equine preparations has been
 performed: a double-blind randomised controlled trial
 comparing intramuscular injection of 10 000 IU equine
 antitoxin with 500 IU human antitoxin in neonates in Haiti
 between 1969 and 1970, with no significant difference in
 outcomes. Animal studies at the beginning of the 20th century
 suggested that antitoxin injected directly into the CNS was
 associated with better outcomes in experimentally induced
 tetanus. Case series and small, low-quality randomised trials in
 humans have reported improvements in mortality and hospital
 stay in both adults and neonates treated with intrathecal
 antitoxin (human and equine preparations). Most of these
 studies were done more than 40 years ago and in settings
 without access to mechanical ventilation. Two meta-analyses
 have been done. Overall findings and subgroup analyses were
 conflicting and frequent methodological bias, lack of safety
 tetanus treatment remains uncertain. The introduction
 of prophylactic equine-origin antitoxin during World
 War 1 markedly reduced tetanus incidence among
 wounded soldiers. 2 There are few studies that have
 formally evaluated the benefit of antitoxin in established
 disease but, in 1960, an open-label trial randomly
 assigned 79 adults and children in Nigeria and Jamaica to
 treatment with or without equine antitoxin (200 000 IU)
 and reported reduced mortality in individuals treated
 with antitoxin (49% vs 76%).
 Specific human antitoxin (human tetanus immuno­
 globulin) became available in the 1960s. Only one
 randomised controlled trial 4 compared intramuscular
 human (500 units) with equine tetanus antitoxin
 (10 000 units), finding no difference in mortality or
 adverse events in 130 enrolled neonates. Similarly, no
 outcome differences were seen in an observational study
 of 386 adults with tetanus in the USA receiving variable
 doses of human and equine antitoxins, but not reporting
 adverse event data. Despite the absence of data
 demonstrating the superiority of human antitoxin,
 evidence, and possible publication bias were cited as important
 limitations with current evidence. Safety data were absent in
 most studies and only one study followed up patients after
 hospital discharge.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 Our study is one of the few clinical trials of antitoxin treatment in
 tetanus in which attending clinical and study staff were masked
 to treatment allocations, and systematic surveillance for adverse
 events and follow-up after hospital discharge occurred. Our
 study is, to our knowledge, the first randomised controlled trial
 comparing human and equine intramuscular antitoxin in adults.
 We found no evidence of differing efficacy between
 interventions and importantly we found no evidence of
 increased adverse events in those treated with equine antitoxin.
 The addition of intrathecal antitoxin did not substantially reduce
 requirement for mechanical ventilation in adults with tetanus.
 Intrathecal antitoxin administration was not associated with
 adverse safety events or detrimental to long-term outcome.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 Equine antitoxin is cheaper and, in many countries, more easily
 available than human antitoxin. Our findings have shown that
 intramuscular equine antitoxin is safe, particularly where human
 antitoxin is unavailable. The additional administration of
 intrathecal antitoxin, although safe, did not add substantial
 benefit to outcomes in a setting with good access to mechanical
 ventilation and low mortality. The small reduction in mechanical
 ventilation rate we observed was similar to that observed in a
 smaller, well conducted randomised controlled trial in a Brazilian
 intensive care unit. Overall, there remains insufficient evidence
 to recommend the routine use of intrathecal antitoxin in the
 treatment of adults with tetanus.
 
<section> concerns over adverse reactions to equine antitoxin have
 led most guidelines to recommend human preparations. 6,7
 In high-income settings, short supply has necessitated
 modification of guidelines to allow substitution of
 human antitoxin with intravenous immunoglobulins
 (IVIg) without supporting clinical evidence. 6–8 In
 resource-limited settings, cost and availability limit the
 use of both human antitoxin and IVIg.
 Early 20th century reports showed that animals
 with experimentally induced tetanus had better outcomes
 if antitoxin was given intrathecally rather than
 peripherally. 9 The first therapeutic use of intrathecal
 tetanus antitoxin in humans was more than 100 years
 ago, 10 but this route of administration was largely
 neglected until the late 1970s. 11–14 A meta-analysis
 including 942 patients from 12 trials of both human and
 equine intrathecal antitoxin reported that intra­ thecal
 administration reduced mortality (relative risk of
 death 0·71, 95% CI 0·62–0·81); however, only two

 lumbar puncture, performed with patients in the lateral
 decubitus position after, if necessary, bolus doses of
 intravenous benzodiazepines and fentanyl. Injections
 were performed using a 20-gauge spinal needle via a
 0·2 μm filter after removal of 2 mL of cerebrospinal fluid.
 Both groups of patients remained in the supine position
 for 4 h after the intervention and were monitored
 regularly, including careful neurological examination at
 1 h. Due to safety concerns, intrathecal injections were
 generally not performed between 0000 h and 0600 h.
 Routine management was delivered by ICU staff
 according to the management protocol of the Hospital for
 Tropical Diseases. 21 Briefly, this consisted of antibiotics,
 wound care, and symptomatic control. Spasm control
 utilises benzodiazepines, escalating to non-depolarising
 neuromuscular blocking agents (pipecuronium), and
 mechanical ventilation. Autonomic nervous system
 disturbance was treated with magnesium sulphate as a
 first-line intervention, adding calcium antagonists,
 fentanyl, or inotropes as indicated. Airway management
 was by initial tracheostomy. 23 According to hospital policy,
 patients received a first dose of a tetanus-toxoid-containing
 vaccine the day before hospital discharge with instructions
 about following doses and reminders at follow-up.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary endpoint was requirement for mechanical
 ventilation during ICU stay. Criteria for mechanical
 ventilation were peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO ) less
 than 90%; or arterial oxygen partial pressure per
 fractional inspired oxygen (PaO /FiO ) less than 250; or
 excessive spasms necessitating muscle paralysis.
 Secondary endpoints were duration of ICU stay,
 duration of hospital stay, duration of mechanical
 ventilation, in-hospital and 240-day mortality, 240-day
 disability evaluated by the modified Rankin score, new
 antibiotic prescription during ICU stay (excluding
 
<section> See 
<section> Online for appendix antibiotics for tetanus or initial entry site infection),
 ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), syndrome of
 autonomic nervous system dysfunction (ANSD), daily
 maximum and minimum heart rate and systolic blood
 pressure, total dose and duration of benzodiazepines and
 pipecuronium during hospital stay, cost of hospital and
 ICU stay, and incidence of adverse events. ANSD was
 defined as at least three of: heart rate more than
 100 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure more than
 140 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure less than 60 mm Hg,
 pyrexia more than 38°C, and fluctuating blood pressure
 occurring within one day with no other apparent cause.
 VAP was diagnosed in patients receiving mechanical
 ventilation for at least 48 h and within the last 48 h, and
 at least two of: temperature of more than 38°C or
 less than 36°C, white blood cell count of less than
 4·0 × 10⁹ cells per L or 12  × 10⁹ or more cells per L, purulent
 respiratory secretions, and new or progressive changes
 on chest radiography. Microbiologically confirmed VAP
 was defined as VAP plus bacterial growth of 1  × 10⁵ or
 more colony-forming units per mL from endotracheal
 aspirate. Outcomes were assessed by study staff blind to
 the study intervention at daily visits and 240-day outcomes
 by telephone (to patients and family members).
 Active evaluation for adverse events was carried out
 daily. All adverse events regardless of grade or severity
 were recorded. Adverse events were defined according to
 the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
 (CTCAE), version 5, classed as any untoward medical
 event that a study participant experienced during the
 course of the study and followed the CTCAE grading
 (grade 1 mild to grade 4 severe). Serious adverse events
 were defined as those that were life-threatening or resulted
 in death, new inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of
 existing hospitalisation, persistent or significant disability,
 or congenital anomaly. All serious adverse events and
 additional specified adverse events were reported to the
 study data monitoring and safety board and relevant
 ethical committees. Patients who were discharged home
 to die were considered in-hospital deaths and analysed as
 deaths occurring at the time of discharge. These deaths
 were confirmed by telephone follow-up.
 The frequency of adverse events was summarised as
 the total number of adverse events and each adverse
 event separately. Tables were generated to summarise the
 proportion of patients with adverse events, tabulating
 adverse events by grade (1–4), number of adverse events,
 and whether these events were judged to be related
 or possibly related to the treatment intervention.
 Comparisons of the proportions were done with the
 χ² test for independence; if the expected number was
 less than or equal to 1 in at least one of the cells,
 Fisher’s exact test was used.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 All statistical analyses were carried out using R,
 version 4.0.2, according to a predefined statistical
 analysis plan (appendix p 89). Data were predominantly
 complete; thus, no corrections were made for missing
 data, and, for each analysis, numbers analysed are
 reported. The study sample size was calculated for the
 intrathecal intervention, assuming no significant
 interaction between interventions, resulting in a sample
 size of 250 patients calculated to detect an absolute risk
 reduction for mechanical ventilation due to intrathecal
 treatment by 17% (from 45% to 28%) with 80% power
 and two-sided 5% significance level. To allow for protocol
 violations and loss to follow-up, this was increased to
 272 patients. Due to low mortality in our setting,
 mechanical ventilation was selected as the primary
 outcome and this difference was chosen as being the
 minimal clinically important effect.
 The main comparison of this factorial trial was the
 comparison between individuals receiving intrathecal

 human antitoxin versus those without (ie, sham
 procedure). As stated in the statistical analysis plan, similar
 evaluations were made for the intramuscular intervention
 (human intramuscular antitoxin versus equine intra­
 muscular antitoxin). Logistic regression was used to
 compare the intervention groups in separate models, with
 sham procedure as the reference group for the intrathecal
 intervention and equine intramuscular antitoxin as the
 reference group for the intramuscular intervention. We
 additionally estimated relative risk between the groups
 based on a binary regression model with a loglink rather
 than the logit link function used in logistic regression.
 For both interventions, the intention-to-treat population
 consisted of all patients randomly assigned to that
 particular intervention. Previous intramuscular antitoxin
 administration resulted in fewer patients being randomly
 assigned to the intramuscular than intrathecal allocation.
 A secondary (exploratory) analysis of individuals receiving
 antitoxin at a previous hospital is included in the appendix.
 The time period between randomisation and the actual
 intervention resulted in a small number of participants
 meeting the primary endpoint before the allocated
 intervention (figure). As detailed in the statistical analysis
 plan, these were excluded from primary endpoint analyses,
 but were included in secondary outcome analyses, safety
 analyses, and a further sensitivity analyses of all patients
 (appendix p 81).
 Interactions between the intrathecal and intramuscular
 interventions were assessed. Heterogeneity of the
 treatment effects in predefined groups of tetanus severity
 score (TSS), American Society of Anesthesiologist
 Score, 24 age, and previous antitoxin administration was
 assessed for intramuscular and intrathecal interventions
 separately via interaction terms. The continuous variables
 TSS 25 (calculated from information available before
 randomisation only) and age were included in the models
 using restricted cubic splines with three knots. Splines
 provide a flexible way to quantify the relation between a
 continuous variable and the outcome. The rcs package in
 R was used to model the spline regression. The knots
 were chosen at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile of the
 values of that variable as the default of the package.
 Robustness analyses with additional knots were also
 performed to test the heterogeneity of age. The knots
 were chosen at the 5%, 35%, 65%, and 95% for 4 knots;
 5%, 27·5%, 50%, 72·5%, and 95% for 5 knots; and
 5%, 23%, 41%, 59%, 77%, for 6 knots. Between each two
 successive knots, the relation was modelled via a
 cubic polynomial, while the relation was assumed to
 change smoothly on both sides of a knot.

 Secondary outcomes for intention-to-treat and per-
 protocol populations are shown in table 3, and in the
 appendix (pp 4, 16–60). For both intramuscular and
 intrathecal interventions, there was little evidence for
 any differences, although intrathecal antitoxin treatment
 was suggested to be associated with shorter ICU days

 studies were subject to significant methodological bias.
 The only data from a setting similar to ours came from
 a Brazilian ICU, which showed that intrathecal
 administration was associated with reduced disease
 progression. Mechanical ventilation was reduced in
 the intrathecal group (38% in individuals treated with
 1000 IU intrathecal human antitoxin compared with
 55% in controls), but the difference did not meet
 statistical significance. 16 It is therefore possible that there
 is a smaller benefit from intrathecal intervention than
 our study was powered to detect. Our sample size was
 calculated after a consensus among international and

 a standard treatment protocol and staff experience are
 important. 23 We were unable to contact three patients
 after discharge, potentially missing post-discharge deaths
 or other complications. However, given the small number
 involved, this is unlikely to have had a significant effect
 on our results. In other ways, the population recruited to
 our study was similar in structure and severity to
 contemporary series from other LMICs. The age and sex
 of cases probably reflects the focus of tetanus vaccination
 programmes in Vietnam and other LMICs, which are
 directed towards infants and pregnant women. 18,32
 Increasing vaccination coverage and improving the
 quality of ICU care remain critical strategies in improving
 
<section> outcomes from tetanus in LMICs.
 
<section> In summary, we found that additional administration of
 intrathecal antitoxin, although safe, does not add overall
 benefit in the treatment of tetanus, particularly in settings
 similar to Vietnam with good access to mechanical
 ventilation and low mortality. Our findings indicate human
 intramuscular antitoxin did not offer any benefit for
 tetanus treatment compared with equine intramuscular
 antitoxin. The study highlights the importance of achieving
 high coverage in global tetanus vaccination programmes.
