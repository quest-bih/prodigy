<section> Background
 Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects approximately 425 mil-
 lion people worldwide and is projected to rise to
 million by 2045, posing major health and economic
 consequences [1]. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
 history, as an independent T2D risk factor, confers a
 seven-fold risk of developing T2D, with the prevalence
 of GDM continuously increasing globally [2]. Inter-
 national Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommends life-
 style modification for individuals at elevated T2D risk
 because of the low cost and scalability without side
 effects. Many large-scale lifestyle trials around the world,
 including Finland, Australia, India, and China, etc., have
 successfully reduced the onset of diabetes among high-
 risk people and/or their risk factors, such as overweight,
 or obesity [3]. For women with a history of GDM, several
 large landmark clinical trials such as the Diabetes Pre-
 vention Program Outcomes Study also have shown that
 lifestyle interventions can effectively prevent or delay the
 onset of T2D [4].
 However, maintaining lifestyle change over time is
 a well-recognized worldwide challenge, and few stud-
 ies investigated the sustainability of lifestyle change in
 response to interventions [5, 6]. In a recent umbrella
 review, the maximum benefit of lifestyle interventions for
 weight management was typically achieved at 6-month
 with a plateau or relapse reported over time, which sug-
 gests that lifestyle intervention effects may diminish over
 time [7]. In addition, according to a recent systematic
 review, over 90% of existing lifestyle interventions were
 conducted within 12-month follow-ups [8]. Current evi-
 dence to support the longer-term (> 12 months) efficacy
 of lifestyle interventions is limited.
 In China, 15.5% of the total population is at high risk
 of diabetes with the incidence of GDM reached 14.8% in
 2020 [9–11]. Among them, the vast majority live in rural
 areas and are underserved due to socioeconomic dis-
 advantages [12], which is not only reflected on limited
 access to diabetes prevention services, but also deriving
 less benefit from these services than urban population
 [13]. It was estimated that the medical expenditures of
 urban residents for diabetes prevention and treatment
 are 2.97 times that of rural residents, with about

 healthcare providers per thousand in urban areas com-
 pared to six per thousand in rural areas in China [14],
 which is often the case in other developing areas such as
 Mexico, India, and Africa [15]. In addition, due to lower
 level of health literacy [16], rural residents tend to have
 difficulties in adopting and maintaining recommended
 behavior changes after lifestyle interventions, which
 may explain the rural-urban inequality of obtained ben-
 efit from lifestyle interventions [17]. Therefore, more
 sustainable diabetes prevention programs tailoring
 underserved high-risk groups are urgently needed.
 Before evidence-based interventions are imple-
 mented into practice, it is necessary to consider modi-
 fying the intervention for subgroups of the population
 [18]. In a recent meta-analysis, lifestyle interventions
 were more effective in women with both glycemic
 intolerance and a history of GDM [19]. Yet, the relative
 magnitude of the lifestyle intervention efficacy in spe-
 cific subgroups (e.g., BMI and ethnicity) has not been
 reported. Our research team contextually tailored the
 Intensive LifeStyle Modification Program (ILSM) for
 women with a history of GDM in low-resource rural
 areas of China. It was guided by the Social Cognitive
 Theory with active ingredients included promoting
 behavior initiation and maintenance [20]. The detailed
 description of the intervention is described in the
 methods section. Our preliminary 6-month efficacy of
 the ILSM showed significant improvement in glycemic
 status, waist circumference, and quality of life (p < .001)
 [21, 22]. Further subgroup analysis is needed to identify
 the impact of ILSM to specific high-risk populations
 along with determining its longer-term effects of ILSM
 on sustained T2D risk reduction among an under-
 served population.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
 18-month efficacy of ILSM for women with a history of
 GDM on T2D risk score (as primary outcome), physi-
 ological (including glycemic and weight-related out-
 comes), and behavioral and psychosocial outcomes
 compared to the control group. We also conducted sub-
 group analyses, comparing women with different BMI,
 waist circumference, and blood glucose to determine
 the differential benefits of the ILSM. 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 This study utilized a cluster randomized controlled
 trial design to investigate the 18-month health impact
 of ILSM among 320 women with a history of GDM in
 rural China. The study was approved by the local ethics
 committee and registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial
 Registry. The details of the rationale, study and results
 of the 6-month follow-up have been published else-
 where [22, 23].
 
<section> Setting and randomization
 The study was conducted in Yongding County and You
 County, Hunan Province in south-central China. Yong-
 ding County comprising 17 towns, has a large ethnic
 minority population (~ 50%, mainly Tujia and Miao pop-
 ulation) in western Hunan Province; and You County
 comprising 14 towns, has a large ethnic Han population
 in eastern Hunan Province. The diversity (i.e., application
 to different geographic locations, ethnic groups, health
 care systems) of the included populations was used to
 test whether the ILSM program could be generalized to
 diverse underserved populations.
 The town (cluster) was the unit of randomization, and a
 randomization protocol available on the internet (http://​
 statt​rek.​com/​stati​stics/​random-​number-​gener​ator.​aspx)
 was used. No specific eligibility criteria for towns were
 identified. Eight towns were randomly selected from each
 county, yielding 16 towns. Following recruitment, the
 towns were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either
 the intervention or the control group with stratification
 for the two counties, and each group included 8 towns
 (4 towns per county). Considering the realistic resource
 restriction in these towns (e.g., lack of resources in town-
 level hospitals, shortage of health care providers), two
 local county-level hospitals with the highest number
 of pregnant and birth-giving women (one per county),
 located in the center of the counties within a close dis-
 tance from these towns, was chosen as the research sites
 to implement the study.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> Inclusion criteria were: 1) adult women with a history of
 GDM; 2) 6 weeks to 10 years postpartum; 3) living in the
 allocated towns and intending to live in these towns for
 at least 3 years; 4) having telephone access, and 5) able
 to read and speak in Mandarin Chinese. Exclusion crite-
 ria were: 1) women who were pregnant or planned to be
 pregnant within the next 3 years; 2) a diagnosis of diabe-
 tes; and 3) other serious health problems, such as physi-
 cal or cognitive disability.
 Eligible women who delivered babies within the past
 10 years at the two research sites were identified through
 a medical record review. Local registered nurses who
 received standardized research protocol training con-
 tacted potential participants via telephone or in-person
 at a clinical visit. Nurses explained the research study
 to interested women, confirmed their eligibility, and
 obtained consent.
 
<section> Interventions
 The timeline of the intervention activities and measure-
 ments for ILSM group and control group is showed in
 Table 1. Both groups received usual care based on cur-
 rent clinical guidelines, including general education
 about their T2D risk as well as a T2D prevention educa-
 tion brochure provided to each participant.
 The intervention group also received the ILSM pro-
 gram from eight trained local nurses following the ILSM
 protocol reported elsewhere [23]. Before the ILSM pro-
 gram, the nurses received a structured five-day train-
 ing from the research team using the Train the Trainer
 Model, which engages master trainers (research team
 members) in coaching new trainers (eight local nurses)
 to be competent to carry out the ILSM intervention. The
 ILSM training entailed self-study, class sessions, and live
 practice, with homework and practice between training.
 The nurses were required to pass a final evaluation held
 by our research team, which included a scenario simu-
 lation test and a personal interview to ensure they were
 equipped with essential intervention delivery skills.
 Each nurse conducted the intervention for a group of
 ~ 20 participants from the same town at the research-
 designated hospitals. Participants were invited to attend
 six biweekly group seminars (90 minutes) and eight tel-
 ephone consultation sessions (20 minutes each). The
 topics of group seminars included orientation and goal-
 setting, healthy eating patterns, physical activity, stress
 management, family support, family lifestyle patterns,
 and relapse prevention and farewell [23]. All content in
 the ILSM program was tailored to the context of rural
 women with a history of GDM. During the intervention
 period, a research assistant acted as a resource person
 at each research site and attended all sessions to assess
 intervention fidelity via a checklist (including evaluation
 concerning four domains: adherence, exposure, qual-
 ity of delivery, and participant responsiveness). More
 details about the fidelity checklist are provided in Addi-
 tional file 1: Appendix I.
 To promote the long-term efficacy of the intervention,
 a series of strategies such as setting recursion goals and
 providing a environmental support, was used. For exam-
 ple, participants were required to set various small and
 easy-to-implement goals concerning health behavior at
 the early stage of intervention to ensure their early behav-
 ioral wins. These early wins help convince participants

<section> that behavior change is possible, thus induced into a
 recursive process and eventually sparking a positive and
 continual behavior change loop. In addition, participants
 were equipped with resources of health behavior change
 during the intervention, and these resources create sup-
 portive physical and psychological environment after
 intervention. By interacting with these essential elements
 and repeatedly reinforcing the desired behavior via envi-
 ronment, long-term benefits will tend to persist and rein-
 force the behavior change.
 Due to the nature of educational and behavioral inter-
 ventions, it was not feasible to blind participants and
 local nurses (investigators), though data assessors were
 blinded. Nurses and study participants were asked to sign
 an agreement that they would not share the intervention
 materials or protocol with others before the completion
 of the study.
 
<section> Outcome measures
 Data were collected at baseline, 6-month, and 18-month.
 At each visit, all participants were invited to complete
 questionnaires on T2D risk assessment, lifestyle behavior,
 and psychological outcomes. At baseline, all participants
 also completed a demographic and clinical questionnaire.
 Data were collected in a quiet room at the research site
 by trained research assistants. At the same time, local
 nurses collected blood samples and completed physical
 examinations for physiological data. Data for women in
 intervention and control groups were collected on sepa-
 rate days to avoid contamination.
 
<section> The demographic and clinical data included age, eth-
 nicity, education, occupation, family income, and the
 number of months after delivery.
 
<section> Primary outcome: T2D risk score was the primary out-
 come, as our target population was high T2D risk groups
 with normal glycemia rather than populations with
 impaired glucose tolerance. Adults with a high risk for
 T2D and normal glycemia have limited room to improve
 glycemic outcomes; thus, glycemic outcomes are unsuit-
 able as a primary outcome. The T2D risk score was devel-
 oped based on specific modifiable diabetes risk factors
 (such as BMI, waist circumference, physical activity, and
 dietary intake), and also includes some unmodifiable risk
 factors, which is in line with the theoretical mechanism
 of most diabetes prevention programs [24].
 The T2D risk score was measured by the Chinese Dia-
 betes Risk Scale (CHINARISK) [25], adapted from the
 Canadian Diabetes Risk Questionnaire [26]. This scale
 systematically combines modifiable and unmodifiable
 diabetes risk factors in order to identify people who may
 develop T2D in the next 10 years. Total scores range
 from 0 to 88; higher scores represent a greater risk of
 T2D. The questionnaire has a positive predictive value
 of 57% and a negative predictive value of 78%, with a
 sensitivity of 73% [25].
 
<section> Secondary outcome: Glycemic outcomes included fast-
 ing blood glucose (FBG) and 2 h Oral Glucose Tolerance
 Test (OGTT) [27]. Venous blood samples were collected
 after overnight fasting, followed by blood samples taken
 2 hours after consuming 75 g of glucose.
 Weight-related outcomes included BMI and waist cir-
 cumference. BMI was calculated by dividing body weight
 (kilograms) by height squared (meters); Waist circumfer-
 ence was measured at the midpoint between the highest
 point of the iliac crest and the lowest rib according to
 WHO standard [28].
 
<section> Behavioral outcomes: Physical activity was assessed by
 the validated Chinese version of the International Physi-
 cal Activity Questionnaire (Short Form) [29]; Fruit/veg-
 etable consumption was measured by an item on the
 CHINARISK scale; The Intention to Eat Low Glycemic-
 index Foods was assessed with a 24-item questionnaire
 that uses a 7-point Likert scale, on which higher scores
 indicate a greater intention to eat low glycemic-index
 foods [30].
 
<section> Psychological outcomes: Perceived stress was meas-
 ured by the 14-item perceived stress scale [31]. Quality
 of life was assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF question-
 naire, which includes 26 items and evaluates physiologi-
 cal, psychological, social relations, and environmental
 domains of quality of life. General self-efficacy was meas-
 ured using the 10-item general self-efficacy question-
 naires [32]. Social support was measured using the
 10-item social support rating scale (SSRS) [33]. All the
 measurements used in this study with well-documented
 psychometric properties and have been used in Chinese
 populations in China [34–37].
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 The analyses were done at the individual level in SPSS
 (Version 22.0; Armonk, NY, United States). The double-
 entry data method was adopted to ensure data accu-
 racy via the EpiData 3.0 software (EpiData Association,
 Odense, Denmark). All randomly assigned participants
 
<section> (N = 320) entered the intention-to-treat analysis, which
 means that the randomization groups were used in this
 analysis, irrespective of any protocol violations. We
 ensured that the outcomes for participants who withdrew
 from the trial prior to the 6- or 18-month were retained
 in the analysis.
 The data were presented as means with SDs or as
 counts with percentages. Descriptive statistics were used
 to describe demographic and clinical characteristics. The
 demographic and clinical data of the intervention and
 control groups were compared using two independent
 samples t-tests and Chi-square tests. Repeated measure 
<section> analyses (three points) were conducted using a general-
 ized estimating equation (GEE) model to compare the
 differences between two groups in T2D risk scores, gly-
 cemic, weight-related, behavioral, and psychological
 variables from baseline to 18-month follow-up. GEEs
 were developed as an extension of the general linear
 model to analyze longitudinal and other correlated data.
 GEE models take into account the correlation between
 repeated measurements in the same subject; models do
 not require complete data and can be fitted even when
 individuals do not have observations at all time points
 [38]. We added an interaction term (group by time) to
 each model to investigate the interactive effects of inter-
 vention and time. Models were performed unadjusted
 and adjusted for age, months after delivery, ethnicity,
 education, marriage, occupation, and family income. To
 assess the potential effects of clustering, we calculated
 the ­eta 2 coefficient for each of the three outcomes and
 three time periods. The ­eta 2 values for FBG ranged from
 0.319 to 0.491. Coefficients for OGTT-2 h and the T2D
 risk score were substantially smaller, ranging from 0.049
 to 0.114. In general, larger e ­ ta 2 values are associated with
 larger standard errors, wider confidence intervals, and
 more conservative p-values. In order to adjust for such
 effects, we used fixed effects GEE regression models
 where the cluster itself is included as a factor within the
 model.
 To assess if the intervention effect was statisti-
 cally different between subgroups, we conducted sev-
 eral subgroup analyses for T2D risk scores: research
 site (You County, Yongding County), ethnicity (Han,
 minority), BMI (≤24 kg/ m2, > 24 kg/ m2), waist cir-
 cumference (≤80 cm, > 80 cm), glucose dysregulation
 
<section> (FBG ≤6.1 mmol/L or OGTT-2 h ≤7.8 mmol/L, FBG
 > 6.1 mmol/L or OGTT-2 h > 7.8 mmol/L) and months
 after delivery (≤12, > 12). We included interaction terms
 (group by subgroup) in the GEE models to assess differ-
 ences between subgroups.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Baseline characteristics and participant retention
 Eight towns were selected from each county, yielding a
 total of 16 towns for this study. Recruitment included
 a screening of 1789 individuals from these towns, of
 which 757 (42.3%) were excluded due to not meeting the
 inclusion criteria, 440 (24.6%) could not be reached; the
 remaining 592 (33.1%) were eligible for further assess-
 ment. Of these, 272 (45.95%) people declined partici-
 pation due to lack of interest (215, 36.3%) or schedule
 difficulties (57, 9.6%), and 320 with an average of
 women per town enrolled. Followed by the intention-to-
 treat principle, data analyses included all participants ran-
 domly assigned to the intervention group (8 towns,
 participants) or control group (8 towns, 160 participants),
 no matter whether they completed follow-up measure-
 ments or received assigned interventions. Participant flow
 is presented in the CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1).
 In the overall intention-to-treat sample, the mean age
 (± SD) was 31.92 (± 4.91) years. About 55.3% were of
 Han nationality, 48.8% had a senior high school or lower
 level of education, and 20% lived with a monthly family
 income lower than 425 dollars (~ 471 dollars, consid-
 ered a low family income in China). The mean time after
 delivery was 17.4 (± 7.2) months. Half of the participants’
 waist circumference was over 80 cm, and the mean BMI
 was 23.56 kg/m 2 (SD = 3.71). Demographic and clinical
 characteristics did not differ between intervention and
 control groups at baseline (p > 0.05). More detailed data
 are provided in Table 2.
 At the 6-month follow-up, 245 participants (76.6%)
 completed measurements (127 in the ILSM group and
 118 in the control group); 287 participants (89.7%) com-
 pleted measurements at 18-month follow-up (138 in the
 ILSM group and 149 in the control group). The overall
 attendance rate was 72% for the in-person sessions and
 telephone consultations of the ILSM program. The final
 program fidelity was 98%. There were no significant dif-
 ferences between participants who completed measure-
 ments and missed measurements on demographic and
 clinical characteristics (p > 0.05).
 
<section> Changes in T2D risk scores
 Taking into account the three-time points and adjust-
 ing for baseline variables and the cluster effect, there
 was a significant decline in T2D risk scores in the inter-
 vention group compared to the control group over time
 (β = − 0.411 [95%CI -0.815, − 0.008]; p = 0.046, adjusted)
 (Table 3 and Fig. 2).
 
<section> Changes in glycemic and weight‑related outcomes
 Participants in the intervention group experienced a
 significant decline of 0.37 mmol/L in FBG compared
 with 0.09 mmol/L in the control group from baseline to
 18-month follow-up (β = −.169 [95%CI −.252, −.087];
 p<.001, adjusted). There were no significant differences
 in OGTT-2 h between groups over time, yet OGTT-2 h
 had a 0.1 mmol/L decline in the intervention group with
 an increase of 1.11 mmol/L in the control group (β = .034
 
<section> [95%CI −.081, −.031]; p = .157, adjusted).
 There was a significant decrease of 1.07 kg/m 2 in BMI
 in the intervention group compared with a decrease of
 0.64 kg/m 2 in the control group (β = −.194 [95%CI −.373,
 
<section> −.015]; p = 0.034, adjusted) at 18-month follow up. The
 percentage of participants with a waist circumference
 over 80 cm also significantly declined (β = −.182 [95%CI
 
<section> −.358, −.004]; p = .045, adjusted) in the intervention

<iend>

 group compared to the control group (18.90% in interven-
 tion group vs. 4.30% in control group) (Table 3 and Fig. 2).
 
<section> Changes in behavioral outcomes
 We found a significant improvement of the intention
 to eat low-glycemic index food in the intervention
 group, whereas it declined in the control group over
 18 months (+ 6.64 points vs. -2.28 points; β = 2.879
 
<section> [95%CI −.776, .224]; p = 0.003, adjusted) (Table 3).
 However, no significant differences were observed in
 moderate and high physical activity levels (β = − 0.129
 
<section> [95%CI -0.485, 0.227]; p = .477, adjusted).
 
<section> Changes in psychosocial outcomes
 The intervention group participants reported a significant
 decrease in perceived negative stress, while the control

<section> Discussion
 In this study, we demonstrated that ILSM significantly
 reduced T2D risk scores and obtained statistically sig-
 nificant benefits for FBG, BMI, and intention to eat low-
 index glycemic food at an 18-month follow-up based
 on the intention-to-treat analysis. This is encouraging
 as previous studies reported that the benefit of lifestyle
 interventions for diabetes prevention was typically sus-
 tained at 6 to 12 months [7]. This exciting result may
 suggest that early behavior interventions are expected to
 touch off a series of reciprocally reinforcing recursions
 and interactions via goal setting and ongoing environ-
 mental support, eventually driving intervention influence
 over time. Also, we found that women who were over-
 weight, had abdominal adiposity, or had blood glucose
 intolerance at baseline benefited more from the ILSM,
 thus identifying the targeted population for future imple-
 mentation. In addition, this program indicated the poten-
 tial of local nurses in providing lifestyle and preventive
 interventions in primary care centers. Overall, the tai-
 lored lifestyle intervention program was demonstrated to
 be effective in diabetes prevention for women with prior
 GDM in a low-resource rural setting. The model of care
 may be considered in other settings and counties.

<section> Consistent with our result in the six-month follow-
 up, the intervention effect on reducing T2D risk scores
 was sustained at 18-month [21]. The longer-term main-
 tenance of reduction in T2D risk score could be attrib-
 uted to the lasting improvement of these modifiable T2D
 risk factors, such as behavioral and psychosocial factors.
 Our results are similar to prior studies that support the
 mediating effect of improvement of health behaviors
 and psychosocial variables on T2D risk reduction [39].
 Subsequent decreases in BMI and waist circumference
 which were classified as modifiable T2D risk factors also
 decreased T2D risk scores.
 Improvement of glucose markers has been identified as
 the key indicator of delaying progression to T2D among
 people with dysglycemia [40]. In this study, we observed
 significant improvement for FBG at 18-month, which was
 also found in our 6-month result. The long-lasting effect
 of ILSM may be explained by sustained lifestyle changes
 of rural women with prior GDM after intervention [41].
 However, the long-term glycemic benefits obtained
 in ILSM was inconsistent with the finding of a recent
 meta-analysis, in which no benefit was found regard-
 ing measures of glycemia [42]. The plausible explana-
 tion is included interventions lacked explicit theoretical

<section> frameworks of behavior change maintenance, which
 could provide guidance on the development and evalu-
 ation of interventions promoting sustained change in
 health behaviors [43, 44]. In terms of OGTT-2 h, the sig-
 nificant difference between two groups was not detected
 at 18-month follow up, though it was improved at
 6-months. The differential efficacy may be due to limited
 improvement room for OGTT-2 h [21], as the majority
 of women with GDM returned to normal glycemic lev-
 els without specific intervention in the year after delivery
 based on current evidence [45]. The early return to nor-
 mal glycemic levels could potentially reduce the adverse
 effect of high glycemic levels on women’s health [46].
 Over 18 months, a significant reduction in BMI and
 waist circumference were determined in the intervention
 group compared with the control group. However, con-
 sistent with most previous studies, the maximum reduc-
 tion was achieved at 6-month with a plateau occurred
 after 6 months [47, 48]. According to the American Dia-
 betes Association’s Adult Weight Management Evidence-
 Based Nutrition Practice Guideline, interventions for
 weight loss should last at least 6 months with a weight-
 maintenance program [47]. In our study, we provided
 three-month intensive core intervention as well as three
 monthly phone calls as the maintenance component
 for participants, in order to prevent weight regain with-
 out ongoing support [49]. As a result, the maintenance
 of BMI and waist circumference was demonstrated in
 the ILSM group, while these weight-related outcomes
 returned to baseline in the control group.
 At 18-month, we found that women in the ILSM group
 have increased intentions to eat low glycemic-index
 food (e.g., dark green leafy vegetables, fish and seafood,
 whole grains or mixed) compared with the control group,
 although this difference between groups was not dem-
 onstrated at 6-months [50]. This may be because the
 adaptation of new eating habits is a complex and gradual
 process, and the increased intention to eat low glycemic-
 index food intake may have taken longer. In the dietary
 sessions of the ILSM, the optimization of carbohydrate
 composition was also included in the ILSM intervention
 by recommending low glycemic-index food to avoid fluc-
 tuations in post prandial blood glucose levels [51].
 The difference in physical activity was not statistically
 significant between the two groups over 18 months.
 Similar results were also reported in other lifestyle inter-
 ventions for women with a history of GDM. According
 to literature, barriers to exercise among this population
 include competing demands for childcare, career pres-
 sure and family responsibility as well as an established
 ethic of care that prioritizes the needs of others (e.g.,
 family and friends) above their own [6, 42], although
 they believe that physical activity is important in the
 prevention of T2DM. It also suggests additional strate-
 gies, such as activity monitoring or group support, may
 be needed to increase physical activity in this population.
 We found significant improvement in social support
 and perceived stress over 18 months, which is con-
 sistent with other studies [6, 52]. The ILSM program
 included sessions on family support and stress coping.
 The importance of involving all family members in dia-
 betes prevention efforts was emphasized and a wide
 range of psychological strategies were provided, in
 order to develop sustainable healthy lifestyles with the
 help of their family [53] and help participants magnify
 their positive experiences and contribute to women’
 confidence in coping with stressful situations [23, 54].
 Consequently, the ILSM group participants obtained
 more psychological resources; thus, their QoL in the
 psychological domain also improved at longer-term
 follow-up.
 The results of our subgroup analyses suggest that
 women with glycemic intolerance and overweight or
 abdominal obese women are more sensitive to the
 ILSM than women with relatively normal blood glucose,
 weight, and waist circumference in reducing T2D risk
 score. As glycemic markers and weight-related outcomes
 are important predictive indicators for future T2D risk,
 and women with glycemic intolerance or weight issues
 have a higher risk for T2DM. This intervention is particu-
 larly helpful in reducing their risk. Thus, we can reason-
 ably infer that higher-risk groups may benefit more from
 lifestyle intervention programs as their physical health is
 in jeopardy, and they have more room for improvement
 in terms of glycemic level and weight [55].
 This study is one of the few intervention studies with
 a long-term follow-up. This study has several strengths.
 First, we conducted a multi-dimensional evaluation of
 an evidence-based intervention, adapted to the local
 context, and adhered to the theoretical framework of
 behavior maintenance. Second, we designed a contex-
 tually-tailored lifestyle intervention, which was imple-
 mented effectively by local nurses with few resources;
 thus, it provides the possibility to improve primary
 healthcare in impoverished health system. More impor-
 tantly, the ILSM may be used as a model for design-
 ing health-related interventions at underserved public
 health settings. Lastly, a robust RCT study design, includ-
 ing cluster randomization, excellent protocol imple-
 mentation, and well-validated questionnaires are study
 strengths.
 There were several study limitations. Due to budget
 and energy constraints, the sample size was calculated
 based on the power of our primary outcome; thus,
 we may not have enough power to detect meaning-
 ful, significant differences in all outcomes. Second, the 
<section> improvement of the ILSM group may be due to the fact
 that they were given more attention (six biweekly group
 seminars and eight telephone consultation sessions)
 than the control group who did not have the same time
 engagement. Thirdly, the self-report measurements for
 physical activity may have recall bias. Lastly, the findings
 of subgroup analysis should be considered exploratory
 and should not be over-interpreted given the number of
 comparisons reported. Future researches are needed to
 
<section> confirm our findings.
 
<section> Despite these limitations, our findings have several
 implications. First, it is important to modify lifestyle
 interventions to the context of women’s lives and to
 address their barriers to long-term lifestyle change. For
 example, maintenance interventions via smartphones
 may be feasible in this population; and strategies that
 promote self-directed behavior change could be incor-
 porated [56]. In addition, studies with larger sample sizes
 to detect changes in behavioral or other outcomes are
 needed. Lastly, the ILSM program has the potential to be
 served as an effective model of diabetes prevention for
 high-risk groups in underserved settings.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> In conclusion, the ILSM provided robust evidence to
 support lifestyle interventions in preventing T2D wasn’t
 weakened by time, but can preserve and strengten it
 over 18 months in women with a history of GDM in low-
 resource rural settings in China. Women with a history
 of GDM who are currently overweight, have abdominal
 adiposity, or have blood glucose intolerance may benefit
 more from a lifestyle program and should be the targeted
 population for further dissemination and implemen-
 tation. This program is a promising model of diabetes
 prevention, reducing health disparities in low-resource
 settings about diabetes prevention globally.
