<section> Abstract
 
<section> Background: Safety protocols are an essential component of studies addressing violence and mental health but are
 rarely described in the published literature from Sub-Saharan Africa. We designed and implemented a safety protocol
 within Project YES! (Youth Engaging for Success), which enrolled 276 youth living with HIV (ages 15–24 years) in a
 randomized controlled trial of a peer-mentoring intervention across four HIV clinics in Ndola, Zambia.
 
<section> Methods: Youth who reported severe violence and/or suicidal thoughts on research surveys or during meetings
 with youth peer mentors (YPM) were referred to designated healthcare providers (HCP). We explored experiences
 with the safety protocol using: a) monitoring data of referrals, and b) in-depth interviews with youth (n = 82), HCP
 (n = 10), YPM (n = 8), and staff (n = 6). Descriptive statistics were generated and thematic analysis of coded transcripts
 and written memos performed.
 
<section> Results: Nearly half of youth enrolled (48% of females, 41% of males) were referred to a HCP at least once. The first
 referral was most often for sexual violence (35%) and/or suicidal ideation/depression (29%). All referred youth aged
 15–17 years and over 80% of referred youth aged 18 + agreed to see a HCP. HCP referred 15% for additional services
 outside the clinic. Twenty-nine youth, all HCP, all YPM, and all staff interviewed discussed the safety protocol. Most
 youth felt “encouraged,” “helped,” “unburdened,” and “relieved” by their meetings with HCP; some expressed concerns
 about meeting with HCP. The safety protocol helped HCP recognize the need to integrate care for violence and men-
 tal health with medication adherence support. HCP, YPM, and study staff raised implementation challenges, including
 youth choosing not to open up to HCP, time and resource constraints, deficiencies in HCP training, and stigma and
 cultural norms inhibiting referrals outside the clinic for emotional trauma and mental health.
 
<section> Conclusions: Implementing a safety protocol within an HIV clinic-based research study is possible and beneficial for
 youth and HCP alike. Implementation challenges underscore that HCP in Zambia work in over-stretched healthcare
 systems. Innovative strategies must address deficiencies in training and resources within HIV clinics and gaps in coor-
 dination across services to meet the overwhelming need for violence and mental health services among youth living
 with HIV.

<section> ranging from about 30 to 50 percent in some African set-
 tings [1, 2]. The prevalence of mental health problems in
 this population is also high. Roughly 20 to 30 percent of
 adolescents in SSA experience suicidal ideation, depres-
 sion, and anxiety [3]. Violence victimization and mental
 health problems are related with each other and inter-
 sect with other developmental and health risks among
 youth, including increased substance use, lower educa-
 tional achievement, and poorer sexual and reproductive
 health [4–6]. Among youth living with HIV, experiences
 of violence and mental health problems have been associ-
 ated with negative HIV outcomes, including incomplete
 antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and virologic fail-
 ure [7–10].
 With the expansion of violence and mental health
 research has come a growing body of evidence on ethi-
 cal and methodological considerations. Adhering to the
 fundamental ethical principles of respect for persons,
 beneficence, and justice is critical to protecting the safety
 of study participants and facilitating quality data [11].
 Guidelines have been developed to promote safety, con-
 fidentiality, training, and informed consent in studies of
 violence [11, 12]. Recommendations target specific study
 populations, including children [13, 14], adolescents [15],
 trafficked women [16], women in conflict settings [17],
 and women with disabilities [18]. However, we identi-
 fied few studies describing safety protocol implementa-
 tion experiences in SSA for violence [19] or mental health
 [20], which is critical for building consensus around best
 practices for safety planning in these research areas [21].
 Moreover, we found no guidance on researching vio-
 lence and mental health among youth living with HIV in
 the region. In addition to the violence and mental health
 symptoms they commonly experience [7–9, 22], these
 youth are vulnerable due to the high levels of stigma and
 discrimination associated with HIV infection [23–25]
 and their developmental stage, which can make them
 prone to impulsivity and risky behavior [26].
 We designed and implemented a safety protocol within
 the Project YES! (Youth Engaging for Success) rand-
 omized controlled trial (RCT) [27, 28]. The RCT assessed
 the impact of a peer mentoring intervention on viral sup-
 pression, ART adherence, and self-stigma among youth
 living with HIV. Youth were consecutively recruited and
 enrolled from four HIV clinics (a children’s hospital,
 an adult hospital, and two primary health facilities) in
 Ndola, Zambia [27]. The intervention consisted of indi-
 vidual and group meetings over six months with a youth
 peer mentor (YPM) who had successfully transitioned
 to HIV self-management. Youth who reporte d experi-
 ences of severe violence and/or suicidal thoughts dur-
 ing the research surveys (at baseline, 6 months post, and
 12 months post), in their YPM meetings, or at another
 time during the study, were referred to designated health-
 care providers (HCP) at the HIV clinics. In this analysis,
 we examine experiences with the safety protocol using
 quantitative descriptive statistics and qualitative in-depth
 interviews (IDI) with youth participants, HCP, YPM, and
 study staff. We aim to: (a) characterize youth’s first refer-
 rals, and (b) explore successes and challenges with the
 protocol’s implementation.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 We employed a convergent, parallel mixed-methods
 design [29], with quantitative and qualitative data col-
 lected concurrently, analyzed independently, and inter-
 preted jointly. Quantitative process data were meant
 to generate summary information on the numbers and
 types of referrals made. Qualitative IDI data were meant
 to facilitate a multidimensional view of the protocol’s
 implementation by capturing experiences, opinions,
 and perspectives from the youth themselves and those
 administering the safety protocol (i.e., HCP, YPM, and
 study staff ). Data from each method was equally consid-
 ered when triangulating the study findings.
 
<section> Safety protocol development
 To create a safety protocol, we consulted recommenda-
 tions from the World Health Organization [12] and safety
 protocol experiences from other settings [19, 20, 30].
 We also sought and incorporated feedback from HCP
 at each participating clinic. The protocol provided step-
 by-step guidance for addressing reports of violence and/
 or suicidal ideation (Fig. 1 and Additional File 1). When
 an issue was identified, YPM or study staff completed a
 form documenting the participant’s connection with the
 designated HCP (i.e., a “referral”). HCP handled cases
 according to clinical practice, local policy, and Zambian
 law. Where appropriate, HCP referred participants for
 services outside of the clinic (i.e., an “external referral”).
 We provided initial and ongoing safety protocol training
 for HCP, YPM, and study staff, in line with ethical guide-
 lines [11].
 Several adjustments were made throughout implemen-
 tation to maintain our ethical obligations beyond the
 most basic “duty of care” [21]. At the request of HCP, Pro-
 ject YES! developed “community maps,” with resources
 on where youth could be referred outside of the clinic.
 To help facilitate external referrals, Project YES! provided
 transport and YPM accompanied youth who wanted it.
 Three months into the project, it became clear that youth
 often did not wish to discuss issues with the HCP at their
 clinic. In response, Project YES! hired and trained a men-
 tal health nurse on study procedures to be based at the

 children’s hospital but remain independent from the four
 participating HIV clinics.
 
<section> Data collection procedures
 Referral forms tracked key information about the referral
 (e.g. date, role of person referring, etc.). HCP recorded
 notes about the meetings held and external referrals
 made in notebooks. Referral forms and HCP notebooks
 were stored under lock and key at each clinic. Informa-
 tion was regularly input into a secure, customized Excel
 database.
 Questions about experiences with the safety protocol
 were integrated into semi-structured IDI with 82 youth
 participants, 10 HCP, and 8 YPM. Two groups of youth
 participants were sampled. Forty-one youth (22 female,
 19 male) were interviewed about their experiences with
 Project YES!. These youth were purposively sampled
 from the intervention arm to achieve diversity in sex, age,
 change in virologic results between baseline and 6-month
 follow-up, and clinic. An additional 41 youth (24 female,
 17 male) were interviewed about their experiences with
 violence victimization and HIV self-management. These
 youth were purposively sampled from both study arms
 to achieve maximum variation in their experiences of
 violence (moderate or severe), virologic results (failure
 or not), sex (male or female), and age group (15–19 or
 20–24 years), using baseline survey data [31]. Youth were
 asked to describe what happened when they were asked
 to see a HCP and how they felt about the steps taken.
 These IDI were conducted by three Zambian interview-
 ers who were not involved in the Project YES! interven-
 tion and had previous research experience with youth
 living with HIV. Prior to the project, they completed nine
 days of training, which included content on the study’s
 safety protocol. Interviewers and youth were matched by
 sex, and IDI were conducted in participants’ preferred
 language (English or Bemba).
 All HCP (7 female, 3 male) and YPM (4 female, 4 male)
 were invited and agreed to participate in IDI (see further
 details elsewhere [32, 33]). Additionally, 6 IDI were held
 with consenting study staff involved in implementing
 the safety protocol (2 female, 4 male), including 3 sur-
 vey administrators, the project coordinator, and 2 study
 investigators. HCP, YPM, and study staff were asked
 a series of open-ended questions to learn about their
 experiences with the referral procedures, including any
 successful and challenging cases, and what (if anything)
 they would change about the safety protocol. These IDI
 were conducted in English by study team members with 
<section> extensive training in qualitative methods and a compre-
 hensive understanding of the project (KM, VB, and EA).
 IDI were held in a private location in or near one of
 the clinics between January and April, 2019. IDI were
 audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated
 into English where needed. Interviewers wrote memos to
 self-reflect on and document their roles in the research
 process through reflexivity [34, 35] and to record their
 reflections on the interview guide, any methodologi-
 cal issues arising, and preliminary findings [35]. Memos
 were also used to document the research process, gener-
 ating an “audit trail” to strengthen the dependability of
 findings [35].
 
<section> Analyses
 
<section> Referral data were merged with baseline survey data to
 obtain the age and sex of those referred. Descriptive sta-
 tistics were generated using counts and percentages. Dif-
 ferences in referral characteristics by youths’ sex were
 assessed using chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests for
 variables with small frequencies, and p values less than
 or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
 Thematic analysis was performed of coded transcripts
 in conjunction with written memos. The study team
 first developed a set of deductive codes based on the
 interview guides. One team member (KM) coded the
 transcripts, adding inductive codes iteratively based on
 emerging themes [36]. Coding was conducted with the
 support of NVivo 12. The study team jointly interpreted
 the quantitative and qualitative data, discussing findings
 extensively to refine interpretations. This involved con-
 sideration of points of convergence, divergence, contra-
 dictions, and relationships both within and between the
 methods [29]. Analyses were carried out in consultation
 with the Zambian research team members to support
 contextually-appropriate interpretation and enhance the
 credibility and confirmability of findings [35]. The goal
 was for “completeness,” [35] whereby the possibility of
 multiple realities would be recognized in an effort to gen-
 erate a more nuanced understanding of the safety proto-
 col’s implementation.
 
<section> Informed consent and ethics
 Prior to enrollment in the RCT, study staff obtained
 informed consent, including consent to participate in
 qualitative IDI. In line with Zambian law, written paren-
 tal/caregiver permission and youth assent was required
 for 15–17-year-olds [37]. The consent process for car-
 egivers described the research in broad terms (e.g. health,
 safety) to protect minors who might be experiencing
 violence from the caregiver, while minors were provided
 greater detail, including that if they disclosed certain
 experiences (e.g., severe violence, suicidal ideation) they
 would be required to see a HCP. Youth aged 18–24, as
 legal adults, had the option of declining a HCP visit. Con-
 sent forms explained that YPM would be informed of
 any referrals made to a HCP (though not of the details)
 so that YPM could provide follow-up support. Informed
 consent for participating in an IDI was also obtained
 from HCP, YPM, and study staff.
 Zambia’s Anti-Gender Based Violence (GBV) Act of
 2011 requires medical practitioners to r eport situations
 of GBV [38]. This study did not trigger any mandatory
 reports. This research was reviewed and approved by the
 Zambia Ministry of Health through the National Health
 Research Authority, and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
 School of Public Health and Zambian ERES Converge

<section> Results
 
<section> Descriptive statistics
 Almost half of youth enrolled in the RCT (45%,
 n = 124/276) were referred to a HCP at least once,
 including 41% (n = 46/111) of male and 48% (n = 78/165)
 of female youth; of these, 27 (22%) were referred on two
 separate occasions and 4 (n = 3%) on three separate
 occasions. Of the youth referred, about two-thirds were
 female and over a quarter were minors (ages 15–17 years)
 (Table 1). There were no statistically significant differ-
 ences in characteristics of first referrals based on the
 youth’s sex. Three-quarters of referrals were made by sur-
 vey interviewers and about 17% by YPM. The reason for
 the referral to a HCP was most often for sexual violence
 (35%), suicidal ideation/depression (29%), and physical
 violence (17%). Of those aged 18 and over, three quarters
 agreed to see a HCP, 7% declined to see a HCP but agreed
 to see the mental health nurse brought on by Project
 YES!, and 18% declined any referral. HCP referred 15% of
 youth participants externally for additional services.
 
<section> Qualitative findings
 All 10 HCP, 8 YPM, 6 staff, and 29 out of 82 youth par-
 ticipants interviewed (20 female, 9 male) described their
 experiences with the safety protocol. Four key themes
 came out of the IDI.
 
<section> Theme 1: Youths’ appreciation for their meetings with HCP
 As the most salient theme from the youth IDI, youth
 welcomed the opportunity to meet with HCP through
 the safety protocol. Both male and female youth partici-
 pants highlighted the benefits of speaking openly with a
 trained professional about the issues they were facing,
 which made them feel “unburdened” and “relieved.” For

 The counselor asked me to be free and I told her
 everything and she advised me on the way forward.
 Thereafter, I felt OK…I could handle what was hap-
 pening…I talked to the counselor for an hour plus.
 She asked me some questions which I answered and
 some questions I did not answer, and she under-
 stood…She gave me advice…I was open. I was free
 with her. (Male participant, aged 18 years)
 
<section> I had the feeling that now I have someone to share
 my problems with. (Female participant, aged
 years)
 
<section> Some youth also described feeling “encouraged” by
 their meetings, which helped them gain clarity on the
 way forward. As one youth explained:
 
<section> I was grateful because what [the healthcare pro-
 vider] explained to me gave me a lot of knowl-
 edge….She even told me, ‘You have a long way to
 go…More opportunities are coming your way, so
 don’t think negatively’…I felt it helped. She told
 me, ‘If you have any problem, you should be com-
 ing to see me.’ (Female participant, aged 18 years) 
<section> Several said they planned to see a HCP again if
 another issue were to arise in the future.
 
<section> Theme 2: Youths’ concerns about HCP referrals
 Some youth expressed discomfort with being referred to
 a HCP, which was a less prominent but important theme
 in the youth IDI. Of the few participants who explained
 their reasons for declining the initial HCP referral, most
 were afraid that their situation would be shared with oth-
 ers at the clinic without their consent. For instance:
 
<section> I never went to see the healthcare provider…
 because…maybe the nurse would tell other peo-
 ple, like the other nurses…[I have] a friend. She is a
 nurse, and she kind of tells us stories. (Female par-
 
<section> ticipant, aged 24 years)
 
<section> One participant was “not comfortable” meeting with a
 HCP given her previous experience with a HCP sharing
 her HIV status with others at the clinic. A few partici-
 pants described initially being hesitant but recognizing
 the benefits after seeing the HCP. A young man explained
 his transition in viewpoint as follows:
 
<section> My reaction to the appointment I was given [is that]
 I was just going to get shouted at. I thought they
 would say bad things on me, but I realized they just
 wanted to advise and also encourage me. (Male par-
 
<section> ticipant, aged 22 years)
 
<section> Theme 3: Referrals as a tool for strengthening HCP support
 
<section> for youth
 
<section> As in the youth participant IDI, the most prominent
 theme in HCP, YPM, and study staff IDI concerned the
 benefits of carving out protected time for youth to meet
 with HCP about their problems. In IDI with HCP, the
 predominant viewpoint was that the safety protocol had
 helped HCP to better understand their youth clients’
 situations. They came to recognize the many challenges
 facing youth living with HIV, their unique needs, and the
 importance of probing—or as one HCP explained, asking
 “a lot of questions so that you get to understand where
 they are, how they’re feeling, what problems they’re going
 through.” In turn, HCP were able to integrate support for
 ART adherence with interrelated issues, such as violence
 and suicidal thoughts. A HCP summarized her change in
 perspective as: “It’s more like we are putting everything
 in one package to help these adolescents who are living
 
<section> with HIV.”
 The main theme in YPM and study staff IDI was that
 the safety protocol had helped many youth receive ser-
 vices by offering a protected time for HCP-youth inter-
 action. Standard clinical review meetings do not typically
 provide a sufficient opportunity to tackle the “burdens”
 these youth face. YPM and survey interviewers appreci-
 ated the protocol’s design since they were themselves not
 equipped as counselors: “Once I [connect] them, they
 will get relevant attention and resources. The healthcare
 provider knows better of how to come up with a solu-
 tion,” said one YPM. Several staff also noted the value of
 documenting whether youth had completed an external
 referral, since this feedback loop in standard care is typi-
 cally missing.
 
<section> Theme 4: Implementation challenges
 Despite positive experiences with the safety protocol on
 the whole, a common and notable thread across the HCP,
 YPM, and study staff IDI concerned the challenges that
 emerged during implementation. These challenges in
 their order of salience included: (a) youth choosing not
 to open up to HCP, (b) time and resource constraints, (c)
 HCP training issues, and (d) stigma and cultural norms.
 
<section> Youth choosing not to open up HCP, YPM, and study staff
 explained that some youth chose not to share with a HCP
 the experiences they reported on a survey or discussed
 with their YPM. As a staff member said, “You’ll find that
 when you get to the healthcare provider, this particular
 client will show ignorance as though they did not respond
 ‘Yes’ to some of the [survey] questions.” This reluctance to
 share hindered the HCP’s ability to offer the youth sup-
 port or connect them with other services. It also required
 additional time from the HCP to develop a full picture of
 the youth’s story. As a HCP explained, “Some youth didn’t
 say much. They didn’t want to share…You often have to
 work to get the young person to tell you what the problem
 is. The healthcare provider has to probe a lot.”
 According to YPM and study staff, youth were con-
 cerned that HCP might share their experiences with oth-
 ers at the clinic. They also noted that some youth feared
 speaking openly since the HCP was “like a mother to
 them” and “they were afraid to be judged.” As a study staff
 
<section> member elaborated:
 
<section> Some of them would refuse because there was some
 familiarity with the healthcare providers at the cent-
 ers. Because maybe the healthcare providers have
 seen them grow and then maybe they tell them no
 sex before marriage…It will be difficult to go to the
 same provider. (Study staff member)
 
<section> YPM and study staff felt that bringing on a mental
 health nurse part-way through the study was valuable in
 allowing the youth to meet with a counselor independent
 from their clinic. Even though a small proportion of the
 youth ultimately agreed to meet with the mental health
 nurse, YPM and study staff received positive feedback
 from these youth about their interactions with the nurse. 
<section> Time and resource constraints HCP themselves, in
 addition to YPM and study staff, noted their tendency to
 be “overwhelmed” with their “work overload,” hindering
 their ability to prioritize Project YES! youth. Wait times
 with clients were sometimes very long, and if a HCP
 was unavailable, the clinic would reschedule the client
 for another day—except in emergencies. The nature and
 duration of referral meetings lacked consistency across
 clinics and providers. A few HCP were highlighted
 across IDI as having provided extensive support dur-
 ing the meetings. As one of these HCP explained, “Each
 time you have a session with this client, you establish a
 relationship which you cannot just get rid of. It becomes
 a lifetime relationship.” However, many HCP only met
 with a youth once about a given issue and did not for-
 mally schedule follow-ups, though they encouraged the
 youth to come see them again. Several study staff mem-
 bers expressed concerns about the quality and longevity
 of counseling provided. For example:
 
<section> Healthcare providers were mostly busy …The par-
 ticipants, when you refer them, I thought they
 were not given much attention…Most of the refer-
 rals they met, it was just for a short period of
 time and usually the healthcare provider would
 be like, ‘She’s OK,’ ‘We are done.’… There were very
 few [youth] who had continuous referral…. Some
 participants still had the same issues [during the
 6 and 12 month visits]…as reported at baseline.
 
<section> (Study staff member)
 
<section> These challenges were exacerbated by HCP turnover
 at the clinics. It took time for the new HCP to become
 accustomed to the safety protocol alongside other
 responsibilities.
 
<section> Healthcare provider training Some study staff described
 recognizing over the course of the study that HCP were
 not trained in handling all cases they encountered (e.g.
 mental health, educational support) despite being the first
 point of connection in the safety protocol. A staff member
 described the dilemma as follows:
 
<section> [One healthcare provider] failed to handle an issue
 and then she told the youth peer mentor, ‘No, when
 you see these cases, don’t bring them straight to me,
 just take them to the psychiatric hospital’….In a way,
 she’s not wrong because she knows she can’t handle
 this. But then in our program, she is the primary
 connection. (Study staff member)
 
<section> HCP themselves expressed feeling “powerless” in cer-
 tain situations and wanted a greater understanding of
 community resources where they could refer youth
 when the issue was beyond their capacity. One HCP, for
 instance, described struggling with not knowing how
 best to handle a case; she said the “biggest issue…itching
 on me was the enablement to give them consistency of
 help…a pathway to further access help.”
 
<section> Stigma and cultural norms As a less prominent theme,
 stigma and cultural norms were raised as influencing the
 extent to which youth participants could receive the sup-
 port they needed for violence and mental health problems.
 One HCP, for instance, described not wanting to refer
 youth externally for psychiatric services due to stigma
 associated with the uptake of these services. She antici-
 pated that youth would turn down the referral “because
 they don’t want to be identified as crazy, nuts…” A study
 staff member described how HCP may have been less
 likely to refer youth elsewhere for services (e.g., to a GBV
 center) if dealing with emotional rather than physical or
 sexual violence, given cultural perceptions of what con-
 stitutes “violence.” He highlighted the need to strengthen
 HCP training on emotional forms of violence and mental
 health broadly to ensure that youth experiencing these
 challenges would universally receive the help they need:
 Personal upbringing, culture…could affect the inter-
 pretation of…what is violence…Usually, I will think
 that healthcare providers may probably refer some-
 one if they think the form of violence is severe…I
 think that healthcare providers may not be likely to
 refer a patient for services arising from emotional
 trauma…as opposed to the way they will refer some-
 body if they have physical injuries. I think that we
 need to strengthen and capacity-build ourselves to
 deal with emotional and mental health issues per-
 taining to violence. (Study staff member)
 
<section> Discussion
 This study offers unique and practical insights into the
 successes and challenges of integrating a responsive
 safety system into a study measuring violence victimi-
 zation and suicidal ideation among youth living with
 HIV in a SSA setting. Both male and female youth par-
 ticipants, alongside HCP, YPM, and study staff, described
 the protocol’s added-value of helping youth connect with
 HCP to talk through issues they are not typically able to
 discuss. The protocol helped HCP recognize the impor-
 tance of asking youth questions to more deeply under-
 stand the intersectional issues they face. Implementation
 challenges included: youths’ concerns with opening up to
 HCP; constraints in time, resources, and training among
 clinic staff to support youth-HCP meetings; and stigma
 and cultural norms inhibiting external referrals for emo-
 tional trauma and mental health issues. 
<section> These findings contribute to the limited published
 experiences of safety protocols in low-resource settings
 [19, 20, 30] and should inform researchers’ safety plan-
 ning—particularly when working with youth who are
 living with HIV. Although the safety protocol for this
 study was designed based on the resources and infra-
 structure of the study setting, the challenges raised in
 the IDIs echo findings from other studies in SSA on
 the importance of: (a) strengthening referral networks
 and coordination across services [19, 20, 39, 40]; (b)
 increasing the capacity of clinic providers to respond
 to a range of violence and mental health issues facing
 youth [40, 41]; (c) tackling broader contextual factors
 at play, such as cultural norms that minimize experi-
 ences of emotional violence and stigma around mental
 health [41]; and (d) encouraging an integrated approach
 to care for youth at HIV clinics [39]. Researchers work-
 ing in similar settings should be aware of these issues
 when crafting their safety protocols and remain open
 to adapting their protocols, as we did in this study. Our
 findings also underscore the ethical responsibility of the
 research team to carefully plan for participant safety.
 This may require researchers to make difficult deci-
 sions, for instance, around whether to hire a counselor
 or social worker for the study or whether to work within
 the existing infrastructure [19, 21].
 Our findings highlight the critical need to address vio-
 lence and mental health issues among youth living with
 HIV, as almost half of both male and female youth were
 referred to a HCP for severe violence and/or suicidal ide-
 ation. Evidence is building on the links between experi-
 ences of physical, sexual, and emotional violence, as well
 as depression/suicidal thoughts, and virologic failure
 among youth in SSA [7, 10, 42]. The fact that these youth
 are in care represents an important opportunity to tackle
 the violence and mental health “burdens” they face for
 their personal wellbeing and to reach UNAIDS’ HIV tar-
 get of 90% of those on treatment having suppressed viral
 
<section> loads [43]
 These findings have implications for addressing expe-
 riences of violence among youth who attend HIV clin-
 ics in Zambia. Zambia’s legal and policy environment
 provides fertile ground for expanding violence preven-
 tion and response efforts to youth living with HIV. The
 government passed one of the most comprehensive gen-
 der-based violence laws in SSA [44], runs a large net-
 work of one-stop-centers for GBV [45], and has led and
 supported large GBV-prevention initiatives [46–48].
 While these efforts indicate the seriousness with which
 the government aims to address rates of violence, our
 findings reinforce literature that HCP in Zambia work
 in resource-limited systems and referral structures in
 place are minimal [49, 50]. Even though our study pro-
 tocol helped HCP recognize the importance of tackling
 violence, suicidal ideation, and adherence as “one pack-
 age,” they struggle to meet these overwhelming needs.
 Although sexual violence was the leading reason for
 a referral, only one youth was referred to a GBV one-
 stop center. Moreover, efforts to address violence in
 Zambia tend to center on women and girls [51]. This
 focus is indeed critical given the persistence of gender
 inequality [51], but our findings also highlight a need to
 address experiences of violence against adolescent boys
 and young men living with HIV. We found no statisti-
 cal differences by sex among those brought to a HCP for
 violence, building on our previous findings of a relation-
 ship between past-year violence victimization and viro-
 logic failure among both male and female youth in this
 study population [10].
 This study fills an important gap in the literature on
 implementing safety protocols with vulnerable popu-
 lations—in this case, youth living with HIV. A study
 strength is its use of both quantitative methods to
 describe referral characteristics and qualitative meth-
 ods to gain perspectives from a variety of stakeholders,
 including the target population (i.e., youth) and imple-
 menters (i.e., HCP, YPM, and study staff ). Given the sen-
 sitive nature of the topics of violence and mental health
 being discussed, participants may not have fully opened
 up to interviewers about their experiences with the safety
 protocol. Furthermore, social desirability bias may have
 been present in HCP, YPM, and study staff IDI given
 their roles in implementing the safety protocol, although
 this bias is likely to have been counterbalanced by the
 quantitative process data collected.
 
<section> Conclusions
 I integrating a safety protocol into a clinic-based study
 addressing violence against youth living with HIV is
 possible and beneficial to youth and HCP alike. How-
 ever, youths’ concerns about HCP referrals and gaps in
 resources and HCP capacity to handle all types of refer-
 rals may pose implementation challenges. These find-
 ings should inform the development of safety plans in
 future studies within low-resource settings, as research-
 ers seek to fulfill their ethical obligations. Youth liv-
 ing with HIV need violence and mental health services
 and referrals, and the fact that they are accessing care
 at HIV clinics offers a critical entryway to meeting
 these needs. Innovative strategies must be developed
 to enhance HCP training, expand available resources,
 and strengthen referral systems within HIV clinics in
 Zambia.
