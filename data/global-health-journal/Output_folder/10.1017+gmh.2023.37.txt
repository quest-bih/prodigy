<section> Introduction
 
<section> In 2020, 3.6% of the global population – 281 million people – had
 migrated and/or were residing across international borders
 (IOM, 2022). In recent years there has been an increase in overall
 migration, labor migration and forced migration, with the high-
 est growth rate observed in Latin America and the Caribbean
 (IOM, 2022). The economic and political crisis in Venezuela has
 led to over 6 million people being displaced primarily to countries
 within Latin America (UNHCR, 2022). Continued conflict in
 Colombia and El Salvador as well as climate-related disasters in
 Honduras, Cuba, among other countries in the region, have also
 contributed to high levels of displacement and migration (IOM,
 2022).
 Forced migration is associated with an increased risk of mental
 health and psychosocial problems among asylum seekers, refugees
 and migrants in Latin America (H. Carroll et al., 2020; Espinel
 et al., 2020; Salas-Wright et al., 2022). Research supporting the
 effectiveness of scalable psychological interventions to reduce
 symptoms of common mental disorders and psychological dis-
 tress, essential aspects of mental health and psychosocial well-
 being (Bangpan et al., 2019), in populations affected by
 humanitarian emergencies has increased (Barbui et al., 2020; Fuhr
 et al., 2020; Tol et al., 2020). However, displacement and migra-
 tion also present psychosocial challenges that extend beyond
 symptoms of distress and common mental disorder. In prelimin-
 ary research, we identified that in addition to psychological prob-
 lems, social protection problems (e.g., gender-based violence,
 feeling rejected and discrimination) were salient aspects of psy-
 chosocial wellbeing among displaced women from Venezuela
 (Greene et al., 2022b).
 Research on promotion and prevention interventions that
 emphasize the social dimensions of wellbeing is scant and often
 suffers from methodological limitations (Haroz et al., 2020). One
 limitation is the lack of evidence on which components of psy-
 chosocial interventions are effective in improving mental health
 and the mechanisms by which they operate. We piloted a
 community-based psychosocial intervention, Entre Nosotras
 (‘among/between us’ in Spanish), that was designed to address
 the psychological and social dimensions of wellbeing for women
 in Ecuador and Panamá (Greene et al., 2022b). In this study we
 tested two versions of the intervention to determine the feasibil-
 ity of research and intervention protocols. A future definitive
 evaluation could then clarify whether specific components
 enhanced intervention outcomes. Specifically, we included a
 modified version of an evidence-based stress management inter-
 vention to one study condition to evaluate (first) the feasibility,
 and (in the future) potential unique effect, of this component
 designed specifically for adults experiencing adversity. Adding
 this psychological component could serve as a model for opti-
 mizing community-based psychosocial interventions in future
 research.

<section> Study objectives
 
<section> The objective of this feasibility trial was to evaluate the appropri-
 ateness, acceptability, safety and feasibility of the Entre Nosotras
 intervention and research procedures to inform the design of a fully
 -powered cluster randomized comparative effectiveness trial.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> This study was a two-arm comparative effectiveness cluster ran-
 domized feasibility trial of two active group psychosocial interven-
 tions designed for displaced and migrant women in Ecuador and
 Panamá. The trial was approved by the Ethics Committees at
 Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Universidad de San-
 tander and Universidad San Francisco de Quito. The trial protocol
 was published and registered online (NCT05130944) (Greene et al.,
 2022a).
 
<section> Study setting
 
<section> This project was implemented in collaboration with HIAS, an
 international non-governmental organization that provides pro-
 tection services, including community-based mental health and
 psychosocial support, to refugees, migrants and other vulnerable
 persons. The study was implemented in 11 communities nested
 within three sites in Ecuador (Guayaquil and Tulcán) and Panamá
 (Panamá City/Panamá West). Guayaquil is a large coastal city and a
 destination for many refugees, asylum seekers and migrants (here-
 after referred to as ‘migrants’) from Colombia and Venezuela.
 Tulcán is a rural area located near the Ecuador–Colombia border
 and often a temporary place of transit for migrants. Panamá City is
 the capital of Panamá and a destination for migrants, primarily
 from Central and South America. Many migrants settle in sur-
 rounding peri-urban areas. The majority of migrants in Panamá
 and approximately half of the migrants in Ecuador are female, most
 of whom are of reproductive age (Blyde et al., 2020). These three
 sites were selected because they have large migrant populations and
 are diverse in terms of urbanicity, service delivery systems, popu-
 lations and other implementation factors.
 
<section> Participants and procedures
 
<section> Randomization and blinding
 Within the three sites, we randomly allocated at least half of the
 communities to receive an enhanced version of the intervention,
 Entre Nosotras, that included an additional stress management
 component. Participants in the remaining communities received
 the standard version of Entre Nosotras. Communities (clusters)
 were randomly allocated to study conditions using a random
 number generator in Stata by a researcher not affiliated with the
 project. Two pairs of communities adjacent to each other with 
<section> overlapping catchment areas were combined into two clusters
 (versus four independent community clusters), thus leading to nine
 randomized community clusters. It was not possible to blind par-
 ticipants, intervention providers or outcome assessors to study
 conditions.
 
<section> Study conditions
 Entre Nosotras is a community- and strengths-based intervention
 designed to mobilize social support, strengthen community con-
 nectedness and stimulate collective action to promote the safety and
 wellbeing of migrant women. The intervention was composed of
 existing intervention components as well as locally designed elem-
 ents assembled through a community consultation process. The
 participatory design of the intervention involved identifying and
 characterizing priority psychosocial problems among migrant
 women in the community through qualitative methods, conducting
 theory of change and intervention design workshops, followed by
 mock sessions to pilot and iteratively refine the intervention
 (Greene et al., 2022b). The resulting intervention aimed to address
 a range of problems prioritized by community members including
 social problems (e.g., interpersonal violence, xenophobia and dis-
 crimination, social isolation and loneliness) and psychological
 problems (e.g., emotional distress and sadness).
 The intervention included five weekly two-hour sessions
 delivered by female facilitator pairs within the community and
 designed to be adaptable across each study site (Supplemental Table
 1). The intervention was designed using content from the HIAS
 Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Curriculum (HIAS,
 2021), Psychological First Aid (World Health Organization, War
 Trauma Foundation, and World Vision International, 2011), Prob-
 lem Management Plus (World Health Organization, 2016), partici-
 patory methodologies (Soliz and Maldonado, 2012) and the
 Community Action Cycle (Save the Children and Pathfinder,
 2013). The enhanced study condition integrated a stress manage-
 ment component into each of the five sessions of the standard Entre
 Nosotras intervention. The stress management component was
 based on the World Health Organization’s Self Help Plus interven-
 tion, and included audio exercises focused on skills for managing
 stress (World Health Organization, 2020, 2021). Within each ses-
 sion, facilitators introduced the skill(s) and the participants prac-
 ticed the skill with the support of audio exercises in Spanish. The
 objective of the study was to test the feasibility, as opposed to the
 effectiveness, of the intervention and associated trial procedures.
 Therefore we did not include a no-treatment control group.
 
<section> Recruitment, screening and informed consent
 Participants were recruited by referral from HIAS staff, community
 workers and community leaders, and through community outreach
 by research assistants. Research assistants contacted individuals by
 phone or in person to provide information about the study. Inter-
 ested individuals were invited to complete a screening after pro-
 viding verbal consent. Participants were eligible if they were 18+
 years of age, identified as a woman, were currently residing in the
 study community, spoke and understood Spanish, and reported no
 to moderate psychological distress (Kessler-6 < 13) (Kessler et al.,
 2003, 2010). In Ecuador, both migrant and host community women
 were included because the integration of these communities
 emerged as a community- and organizational-priority during the
 formative research in Ecuador and was expected to promote
 migrants’ wellbeing (Berry, 1985; Berry and Hou, 2021). In Pan-
 amá, migrant women were included in the study. Participants in
 both sites were excluded if they reported severe psychological
 distress (Kessler-6 score ≥ 13), disclosed suicidality or displayed
 cognitive impairment that would prevent participation in a group
 psychosocial intervention. Excluded participants were referred to
 HIAS for further assessment and services. Interested eligible parti-
 cipants provided written informed consent before completing a
 baseline assessment.
 
<section> Data collection and measures
 Participants completed a baseline assessment within 1 week of
 enrollment and attended the first of five weekly intervention ses-
 sions within 2 weeks of completing the baseline. Two follow-up
 assessments were conducted by a research assistant after the inter-
 vention (i.e., 5 weeks post-enrollment) and again 5 weeks post-
 intervention (i.e., 10 weeks post-enrollment).
 During this follow-up period we selected 10 facilitators and up
 to 30 participants per site to complete in-depth qualitative inter-
 views to explore the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and
 safety of the intervention and research procedures. We randomly
 selected participants within the following strata: intervention com-
 pleters (4–5 sessions), low attenders (0–2 sessions), participants
 with high baseline distress (Kessler-6 score > 10), participants with
 low baseline distress (Kessler-6 score < 5), and both host and
 migrant community members. Assessments were designed to be
 conducted remotely or in person, depending on COVID-19 policies
 and recommendations. Participants who completed the assess-
 ments in person were reimbursed for transportation costs and given
 a take-away snack. Participants who completed the assessments
 remotely were reimbursed for airtime or internet connectivity.
 We collected participant-, service- and implementation-level
 measures to evaluate appropriateness, acceptability, safety and
 feasibility using qualitative and quantitative measures (Proctor
 et al., 2011). Participant-level outcomes assessed at baseline and
 both follow-up assessments aligned with the priority outcomes
 identified in the formative research (Greene et al., 2022a,b). Assess-
 ment tools included the Brief COPE to measure coping (Carver,
 1997); the World Health Organization Disability Assessment
 Schedule (WHODAS) to measure functioning (World Health
 Organization, 2010); the Kessler-6 to measure psychological dis-
 tress (Kessler et al., 2002); the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) to
 measure psychosocial wellbeing, including the subscales of com-
 munity connectedness and sense of safety (International Wellbeing
 Group, 2013); and the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSS-3) to assess
 social support (Kocalevent et al., 2018). The PWI, the 10-item
 Kessler scale, Brief COPE and WHODAS have demonstrated
 adequate psychometric properties in Spanish-speaking populations
 (Moran et al., 2010; Terrez et al., 2011; Serrano-Duenas et al., 2020;
 Perez-Belmonte et al., 2021).
 Service-level outcomes included participant attendance and
 adverse events, which were captured using structured intervention
 monitoring forms completed at each Entre Nosotras session, and
 perspectives on intervention appropriateness, acceptability and
 safety.
 Implementation-level measures included a fidelity checklist that
 was completed by facilitator pairs at the end of each session. A
 member(s) of the research team also observed at least two sessions
 of the intervention per group and completed the fidelity checklist
 during these sessions to enable a comparison of the self vs. external
 fidelity evaluations. Facilitator competency was assessed by a
 research team member during observed intervention sessions using
 six items from the Enhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic
 Factors (ENACT) rating scale (Kohrt et al., 2015a,b). We measured
 intervention usability from the perspective of facilitators at the end 
<section> of the final Entre Nosotras session using the 10-item Intervention
 Usability Scale (Lyon et al., 2021). We gathered other information
 on primary outcomes (appropriateness, acceptability, safety and
 feasibility) through structured intervention monitoring forms,
 tracking logs (e.g., recruitment rates) and qualitative interviews.
 
<section> Analyses
 
<section> We examined the distribution of baseline participant-level charac-
 teristics in the overall sample and stratified by study condition and
 site. We calculated effect sizes to compare the magnitude of differ-
 ences in these variables by site and condition using Cohen’s d for
 continuous variables compared across study conditions, Eta-
 squared for continuous variables compared across site, and Cra-
 mer’s V for categorical variables compared across site and study
 conditions.
 We evaluated the psychometric performance of psychosocial
 outcome measures by assessing the internal consistency using
 Cronbach’s alpha, internal construct validity using confirmatory
 factor analyses and external construct validity by estimating the
 correlation among baseline levels of psychosocial outcomes. Fit of
 the CFA models was evaluated using the chi-squared test statistic
 (model vs. saturated), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis
 Index (TLI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)
 and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). We
 reported the mean difference and 95% confidence interval from
 baseline to each follow-up timepoint by study condition to explore
 sensitivity to change for the psychosocial outcome measures. We
 reported Cohen’s d effect sizes for within- and between-group
 changes.
 To evaluate service- and implementation-level outcomes, we
 employed a mixed-methods, explanatory analysis approach. We
 first described the distribution of attendance by study condition
 and community. We examined baseline correlates of intervention
 completion, defined as attending four or more sessions, as well as
 attrition, which was defined as missing one or both follow-up
 assessments. Baseline correlates included demographic, migration
 and psychosocial characteristics, which were regressed on binary
 service-level outcomes (e.g., intervention completion and attrition)
 using logistic regression. We reported descriptive statistics on other
 service- and implementation-level indicators. These included the
 proportion of individuals screened who were eligible, intervention
 fidelity, intervention usability, recruitment rate, facilitator compe-
 tency levels, contamination and adverse events. We used a thematic
 approach to analyze the qualitative interviews. All themes emerging
 from the data were mapped onto larger domains that aligned with
 the study outcomes (appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility and
 safety) (Braun and Clarke, 2006; Braun and Clarke, 2014). Three
 coders reviewed 10% of the study transcripts to develop a prelim-
 inary codebook and achieved 98.38% agreement when applying
 those codes to two additional transcripts prior to independently
 coding the remaining transcripts. Qualitative themes and codes
 were used to explain quantitative findings.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Participant-level outcomes
 
<section> Characteristics of the sample at baseline
 From the 342 women contacted from nine community clusters,
 275 (80.4%) completed the screening (see Figure 1) (Eldridge et al.,
 2016); most were eligible and enrolled in the study (n = 225 of 275;
 81.8%). On average, we enrolled 11.5 women per week. Random-
 ization of five community clusters to the enhanced Entre Nosotras
 intervention and four to the standard Entre Nosotras intervention
 resulted in 121 women receiving the enhanced version and
 104 women receiving the standard version. Seventy-seven partici-
 pants completed in-depth qualitative interviews during the follow-
 up period. Thirty intervention facilitators completed in-depth
 qualitative interviews.
 At baseline women were 36 years of age, on average (SD = 11.7;
 Table 1). Most had completed secondary school (52.0%) or college
 (24.7%). Approximately half were unemployed (53.8%) and 30.5%
 engaged in informal work. We observed lower levels of education
 and higher rates of unemployment among participants in Tulcán
 relative to Guayaquil and Panamá. Approximately two-thirds of
 women were Venezuelan (65.9%), followed by Colombian (14.8%),
 Ecuadorian (12.6%) and other nationalities including Cuban,
 Dominican, El Salvadoran, Honduran, Nicaraguan or reported
 multiple nationalities (6.7%). In Ecuador, 19.6% of the sample were
 members of the host community. In Panamá, all participants were
 migrants, primarily from Venezuela (45.1%), Colombia (37.8%) or
 Central American and Caribbean countries (17.1%). One-quarter
 of migrants in the sample (26.9%) had arrived within the last year.
 The most common reasons for leaving their country of origin
 included economic difficulties (43.8%), family reasons (25.8%),
 political violence or armed conflict (14.4%), or work and other
 opportunities (7.2%). Participant-level differences in demographic,
 migration or psychosocial characteristics at baseline were small
 (effect sizes < 0.5).
 
<section> Psychosocial outcomes
 The reliability and validity of outcome measures displayed variable
 results. Internal consistency at baseline was adequate for the Per-
 sonal Wellbeing Index ( α = 0.781), the Brief COPE ( α = 0.784) and
 the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule ( α = 0.842). The
 Kessler-6 ( α = 0.483; 6 items) and Oslo Social Support Scale
 (α = 0.539; 3 items) displayed low internal consistency. The fifth
 item on the Kessler-6 (‘feeling like everything was an effort’) revealed
 low item-rest correlation and, if removed, would result in a five-
 item measure of psychological distress with improved, although
 still low, internal consistency ( α = 0.594). This item has displayed
 low loadings and weak item-rest correlations in a previous valid-
 ation study of the 10-item Kessler scale in Ecuador (Larzabal-
 Fernandez et al., 2023).
 The internal construct validity of most measures revealed
 adequate to good fit statistics consistent with single-factor models,
 with the exception of the Brief COPE, which displayed the best fit
 for its recommended three-factor structure. The model fit of the
 Personal Wellbeing Index, Brief COPE and WHO Disability
 Assessment Schedule improved with the inclusion of covariances
 between specific items as determined by the modification indices.
 After these modifications were made, the Kessler-6 and Personal
 Wellbeing Index displayed good model fit. The Brief COPE and
 WHODAS displayed adequate fit. The Oslo Social Support Scale
 did not yield fit statistics enabling evaluation of its internal con-
 struct validity. Details of model fit and specification are provided in
 Supplemental Table 3.
 The correlations among baseline psychosocial measures
 revealed mixed support for their external construct validity. Psy-
 chosocial wellbeing and its subscales (community connectedness,
 sense of safety) as well as social support were inversely correlated
 with psychological distress and functional impairment, as

 We observed small to moderate within-group changes from
 baseline to the first follow-up assessment in psychosocial wellbeing,
 sense of safety and community connectedness, suggesting the
 appropriateness of these psychosocial outcomes (d = 0.30–0.43;
 Table 3). The magnitude of these changes attenuated at the 10-week
 follow-up. These outcomes were corroborated by the changes
 attributed to the intervention reported in qualitative interviews.
 Perceived impacts included improved wellbeing and self-esteem,
 personal empowerment and confidence, social networks, and
 awareness of resources to help address safety concerns and violence.

 displayed a significantly greater decrease in the enhanced Entre

 in the enhanced Entre Nosotras intervention:

<section> Service-level outcomes
 
<section> Participant attendance
 Seventy-eight percent of participants enrolled in the study attended
 at least one session and approximately half (49.8%) completed the
 intervention; 64.0% of participants who attended at least one
 session completed the intervention. The median number of sessions
 attended was three (IQR: 1, 5). Attendance and likelihood of
 intervention completion were significantly lower in the enhanced
 condition (Mean difference = 0.7 sessions, 95% CI: 1.2, 0.2;
 
<section> Completion: OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.65; Supplemental Figure 1).
 We conducted a secondary multivariate analysis of attendance as a
 function of study condition and community to explore whether
 variation in attendance was explained to a greater extent by study
 condition. These results revealed that the community context
 largely confounded the association between study condition and
 attendance, which was no longer significant in adjusted models
 (Mean difference = 0.2 sessions, 95% CI: 1.3, 0.8). Attendance
 was higher in Panamá (Median = 4 sessions, IQR: 2, 5) relative to
 
<section> Guayaquil (Median = 3 sessions, IQR: 0, 4) and Tulcán (Median =
 sessions, IQR: 0, 5; Supplemental Figure 2). Several participant-
 level characteristics were associated with the odds of completing the
 intervention (Supplemental Table 2). Women who were older
 (OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.07), living in Panamá relative to
 
<section> Guayaquil (OR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.22, 4.46), were members of the
 host population (OR = 2.85; 95% CI: 1.20, 6.79), had been living in
 the community for more than 3 years (OR = 2.32; 95% CI: 1.14,
 4.69), migrated for family reasons (OR = 5.50, 95% CI: 1.36, 22.22)
 and had lower levels of psychological distress at baseline (OR = 0.91;
 95% CI: 0.84, 0.99) were significantly more likely to complete the
 intervention.
 Qualitative interviews revealed common barriers to attendance
 including lack of time due to work, school, and/or family obliga-
 tions; lack of resources and economic instability; fear of attending
 due to COVID-19 transmission risk; insecurity in the study com-
 munity; or being controlled by their husbands. When sessions
 took place online due to COVID-19, some women did not have
 access to the internet, phones or technology that would enable
 them to attend. Most women were comfortable attending and
 participating in groups. However, some reported not feeling com-
 fortable sharing their problems with others, particularly migrant
 women who were afraid to share their problems with members of
 the host community.
 
<section> ‘I can’t take the day off (to attend the intervention) because I can’t pay
 rent. I’m a single mother. I just live with my baby daughter and my
 son… HIAS does help me with the food card, but (my baby’s) diapers I
 have to pay for. I’m very busy so sometimes I don’t come (to the
 intervention). I start selling cold cakes and stuff at home, and I go out
 to sell any little thing. I can’t stop working’. – Participant in Tulcán,
 
<section> 25 years.
 
<section> Factors that helped women overcome these barriers included
 motivation to attend, having financial security, living near the
 intervention site, being able to bring children to sessions or offering
 childcare, flexible scheduling tailored to participant availability,
 and reimbursement for transportation and/or connectivity costs.

<section> Implementation-level outcomes
 
<section> The Entre Nosotras intervention appeared to be safe, usable and
 feasibly implemented by trained, lay facilitators living in the study
 communities. In qualitative interviews, participants reported suf-
 ficient mitigation of potential risks, including COVID-19 precau-
 tions and carefully selecting safe locations and times for sessions.
 Facilitators reported an average usability score of 82.7 (SD = 10.4)
 out of 100, which is above the cutoff for ‘acceptable’ usability of
 70 points (Lyon et al., 2021). Facilitators demonstrated high com-
 petency scores (Mean = 2.8 out of a maximum of 3.0; SD = 0.30).
 The proportion of sessions where there was >75% fidelity to inter-
 vention elements was high when assessed by an external rater (88%)
 and moderate when assessed by the facilitators themselves (59%;
 Supplemental Table 4). Implementation modalities differed by site
 and over time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Panamá and
 Tulcán, all sessions were delivered in person. In Guayaquil,
 approximately 40% of sessions were delivered online halfway
 through the implementation period.
 We identified some challenges to the implementation of the
 research procedures. One pair of facilitators in each site reported
 applying the stress management activities in the fourth session of
 the standard condition (i.e., three sessions total) in their fidelity
 checklist. None of the external raters reported observing contam-
 ination. The study had a slower recruitment rate and higher levels of
 attrition than were expected with variation observed across com-
 munities and over time (i.e., different stages of the COVID-19
 pandemic and rapidly changing contexts). There were no other
 major protocol deviations or any serious adverse events detected
 during the study and no major baseline imbalances by study
 condition despite the diverse communities included in the study.
 All participant-, service- and implementation-level indicators of
 the primary feasibility trial outcomes (appropriateness, acceptabil-
 ity, feasibility, safety) are summarized in Table 4.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> This feasibility trial aimed to examine the appropriateness, accept-
 ability, safety and feasibility of conducting a fully powered cluster
 randomized trial of the Entre Nosotras intervention. We assessed
 these outcomes at the participant, service and implementation
 levels to determine whether the intervention and research proced-
 ures were adequate and warranted progression to a definitive trial
 (Proctor et al., 2011).
 Overall, intervention and research procedures were considered
 appropriate as determined by the high proportion of those screened
 who were eligible, moderate sensitivity to change in some primary
 outcome measures that were corroborated by qualitative findings,
 appropriateness of the intervention as reported by participants and
 facilitators, and high levels of intervention fidelity as assessed by
 external raters. Facilitator fidelity self-ratings were lower than those
 reported by external raters, reflecting a more critical self-evaluation
 by facilitators of their own adherence to intervention procedures or
 bias by external raters who were research team members. Generally,
 intervention fidelity remained high across sites and sessions,
 suggesting alignment of the content with the implementation con-
 text (C. Carroll et al., 2007; von Thiele Schwarz et al., 2019).
 Facilitator reports of acceptability and usability were high. No
 serious adverse events or major risks of participation in the study
 were detected. However, participant attendance and intervention
 completion were low. Most participants who attended at least one
 session ultimately completed the intervention. Qualitative inter-
 views suggest that the major barriers to attendance were related to
 contextual factors (e.g., COVID-19, limited time, competing
 responsibilities, distance to sites and telecommunication chal-
 lenges). We identified differential rates of intervention completion
 across study conditions, which may be explained by differences
 across communities. Available data did not provide other indica-
 tions of differential acceptability across study conditions, but this
 requires further exploration. Some factors that may have influenced
 differences in intervention retention across communities and sites
 include the variable roles and profiles of facilitators, resources
 across sites (e.g., transportation subsidy in Panamá), sessions
 offered virtually due to COVID-19, population mobility and sta-
 bility across communities, employment options (e.g., informal
 work), and other contextual factors (e.g., climate influencing
 attendance). It is important to develop strategies to promote the
 intervention’s acceptability and accessibility for participants that
 are tailored to each implementation context.
 Adjustments to the research procedures are needed before con-
 ducting a definitive trial. The recruitment and attrition rates (e.g.,
 attending at least one session), and performance of some outcome
 measures did not achieve needed target benchmarks. Indicators of
 instability (e.g., unemployment, recent and forced migration and
 higher distress) contributed to higher odds of intervention dropout
 and study attrition. Conducting assessments by telephone was a
 helpful strategy to promote retention. However, phone numbers
 frequently went out of service, particularly when participants
 migrated to other locations or were not able to purchase phone
 data/min. Safe strategies for maintaining connection with study
 participants through social media, secondary contacts or more
 regular interim follow-ups to track mobility or risk for attrition
 as well as reasons for variation in attendance across study commu-
 nities should be explored in further research. The higher levels of
 intervention completion for participants with more stability sug-
 gest that the intervention may require further adaptation and
 optimization for harder-to-reach individuals whose voices may
 not have been as represented in this intervention design process.
 We identified evidence of contamination across study conditions in
 the fourth session as evidenced by facilitators in the standard
 condition reporting that they implemented activities focused on
 ‘Acting on your values and being kind’, which come from the
 enhanced intervention components. These instances of contamin-
 ation were not observed by external raters. It is possible that this
 item on the fidelity checklist was interpreted as referencing other
 activities that were part of the standard condition. There was
 variation in sensitivity to change across measures suggesting that
 some of the selected outcomes (distress, functioning, social support,
 and emotion-focused and avoidant coping) need to be recon-
 sidered. In contrast, we found that several aspects of the research
 design were feasible. Cluster randomization did not yield any
 moderate to large differences in baseline characteristics between
 study conditions despite the diverse communities included in the
 study. Also, study facilitators achieved sufficient competency levels
 supporting the use of a task-sharing model.
 Findings should consider the following limitations. First, there
 was a lack of blinding in the study, which may have introduced

 Facilitator competencies: An average score of >2 on
 competency items, suggesting partially-fully
 demonstrating the competencies during intervention
 implementation.
 ENACT Average competency score = 2.80 (SD = 0.30).
 Contamination: Stress management components from
 the experimental conditions are included in all sessions
 for groups randomized to the enhanced intervention and
 none of the sessions for groups randomized to the
 standard intervention.

 stress management activities in the 4th session of the
 standard condition; none of the external raters
 observing sessions reported contamination
 Performance of outcome measures: All outcome
 measures display adequate construct validity and
 internal consistency
 Brief-COPE, K-6,

 bias into the study outcome assessment. While most of the psy-
 chosocial outcomes had been previously validated in Spanish-
 speaking populations and/or migrant populations, none had been
 previously validated within the study setting and/or population. It
 is possible that these measures may not accurately capture the
 priority problems identified in the formative research and meas-
 urement error may increase the risk of bias and imprecision in
 results from this study. Future studies in this population may
 consider the modifications to the measures made in this study to
 improve their construct validity and reliability prior to using them
 as screening or outcome measures. Additionally, there was vari-
 ation in some key implementation processes across sites that was
 determined by the implementation context and based on the
 suggestion of community members and other stakeholders during
 the intervention co-design process. For example, in Panamá, the
 study eligibility was restricted to migrants, and the facilitator pairs
 were comprised of one non-specialist and one individual with a
 background in mental health. In Ecuador, participants included
 host community members in addition to migrants, and the facili-
 tator pairs were comprised of two non-specialists without prior
 training in mental health. Differences in the COVID-19 pandemic
 across sites led to different implementation timelines and proced-
 ures (e.g., 40% of sessions in Guayaquil occurred online). This
 heterogeneity may have masked meaningful variation in some of
 the study outcomes. Results from this study are not able to
 definitively determine whether the addition of the stress manage-
 ment components to the standard Entre Nosotras intervention
 improved participant-, service-, or implementation-level out-
 comes. Few differences were observed between the two study
 conditions. Future directions included studies designed to evalu-
 ate the comparative effectiveness of these interventions and
 explore the added value of specific intervention components 
<section> through optimization trials, as well as mixed-methods analyses
 exploring mechanisms of change.
 Notwithstanding these limitations, these findings are promis-
 ing and indicate that a community-designed psychosocial inter-
 vention designed with migrant women through an extensive
 participatory research process and delivered through task sharing
 is feasible in diverse contexts. Furthermore, it was feasible to
 integrate locally designed intervention elements with existing
 evidence-based intervention components and test variations of
 these interventions within complex, dynamic contexts. Research
 procedures that balance the flexibility to work across these diverse
 implementation contexts while maintaining internal validity of
 evaluations of community-based psychosocial programs are
 needed to strengthen generalizable evidence on these interven-
 tions in humanitarian settings. The knowledge attained will
 inform further tailoring of the implementation and evaluation
 of the Entre Nosotras intervention. Additionally, further research
 testing specific intervention components and variations, includ-
 ing whether site-specific variations (e.g., inclusion of host com-
 munities and profiles of intervention facilitators) moderate
 intervention effectiveness and implementation outcomes, is
 needed to identify the active ingredients and essential elements
 of psychosocial interventions and to design more effective and
 efficient programs in community settings.
