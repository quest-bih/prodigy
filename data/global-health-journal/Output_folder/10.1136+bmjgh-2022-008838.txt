<section> WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 
<section> ⇒ Direct-­ to-­ beneficiary mobile communication pro-
 grammes offer great potential to disseminate health in-
 formation at a population level; reaching a large number
 of beneficiaries rapidly and at low cost. As a result, they
 are among the few examples of digital health solutions
 to scale widely in a range of settings globally. Despite
 their potential, no evidence exists of the impact of these
 programmes at scale in low-­income and middle-­income
 countries where the majority of maternal and child
 deaths occur each year. The evidence that does exist is
 limited to smaller scale pilots; key programme compo-
 nents of which often change in the process of scaling up.

<section> BACKGROUND
 Direct-­t o-­beneficiary mobile health
 (mHealth) programmes which provide
 stage-­ based health information to new
 and expectant mothers have proliferated
 rapidly throughout the last decade. 1–3
 In low-­ i ncome and middle-­ i ncome coun-
 tries where the majority of maternal and
 child deaths occur, mHealth messaging
 programmes are among the few examples
 of digital health programmes to success-
 fully scale. Five programmes globally have
 scaled to reach over a million subscribers
 in Bangladesh, 4 5 India, 6 7 South Africa
 and Tanzania.
 Evidence linking scaled mHealth messaging
 programmes to changes in health outcomes
 is limited 7–12 ; a factor which may impede
 sustainability and further expansion. 13 The 
<section> WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
 
<section> ⇒ Kilkari is the largest direct-­to-­beneficiary mobile communication
 programme in the world and has reached over 10 million women
 and their families across 13 states in India. Our study is the first ran-
 domised controlled trial conducted to date of a beneficiary mobile
 communication programme at scale. Exposure to Kilkari was sig-
 nificantly associated with improvements in a few important health
 practices, including the use of reversible contraceptive methods,
 but not others, including exclusive breast feeding. Subgroup anal-
 yses highlight the differential impact among key population seg-
 ments, including the poorest.
 
<section> HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR
 
<section> POLICY
 
<section> ⇒ Study findings provide the most conclusive evidence to date on the
 effectiveness of the largest beneficiary mobile communication pro-
 gramme in the world. The differential targeting of key population
 segments could serve to deepen the impact. Further research is
 needed to assess the impact of shorter duration campaigns less
 susceptible to SIM change, network disruptions and population
 migration.
 
<section> scant evidence available suggests varied impacts on a
 range of outcomes including improvements in birth
 weight ; infant feeding practices 7 ; utilisation of early
 and complete antenatal care (ANC), 8 9 facility-­based
 skilled birth attendance, 10 12 maternal and childhood
 immunisation services ; and reductions in perinatal
 mortality. 11 However, efforts to compare and generalise
 these findings have been hampered by wide variations in
 study contexts and programme components including
 the content, modality, frequency of messages and
 supporting programmatic activities. 14 The small scale of
 these programmes at the time that they were evaluated
 also limits the generalisability of the findings observed.
 As programmes scale they often undergo significant
 changes in design, implementation and resource avail-
 ability, which can lead to a ‘voltage drop’ in a range of
 factors including reach, exposure and impact on bene-
 ficiary practices and health behaviours. 2 15 These chal-
 lenges underscore the need for evidence at each stage of
 an mHealth programme’s maturity from pilot to delivery
 of services at scale, to a large number of beneficiaries.
 Kilkari is the world’s largest mHealth messaging
 programme of its kind. Kilkari is an outbound service
 that makes weekly, stage-­based, prerecorded calls about
 reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health
 (RMNCH) directly to families’ mobile phones, starting
 from the second trimester of pregnancy until the child
 is 1 year old. BBC Media Action designed and piloted
 Kilkari in the Indian state of Bihar in 2012–2013, and
 then redesigned and scaled it in collaboration with
 the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW)
 between 2015 and 2019. Prior to its transition to MoHFW
 in April 2019, Kilkari had been scaled to 13 states across
 India and reached over 10 million subscribers.
 From 2018 to early 2020, an individually randomised
 controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in four districts
 of Madhya Pradesh to determine the effectiveness of
 Kilkari. This study sought to assess whether exposure to
 mHealth information calls during pregnancy and post-
 partum improved infant feeding and family planning
 practices. This is the first study to evaluate the impact
 of a maternal mHealth messaging programme at scale;
 additional details on the evaluation protocol have been
 published elsewhere.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Trial design
 
<section> The study is an individually RCT with a parallel and
 unblinded design.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> At the time of randomisation in late 2018, women
 enrolled to the study (n=5095) were 12–34 weeks of gesta-
 tion, more than 18 years of age, could speak and under-
 stand Hindi, and owned or had access to a mobile phone
 during the day when Kilkari calls were likely to come.
 Women were excluded who did not consent or who were
 mobile subscribers of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited
 (the state-­owned telecommunications company) due to
 poor network coverage in the RCT districts in Madhya
 Pradesh. Given the shared nature of mobile phones, the
 husbands of women enrolled to the study were addition-
 ally interviewed as part of endline survey activities.
 
<section> Study setting
 
<section> Women in India have limited access to and use of mobile
 phones. Despite near universal household level phone
 ownership (92.8%), only 47.8% of Indian women have
 access to a mobile phone (41.6% in rural areas and
 62.7% in urban). 18 In the central Indian state of Madhya
 Pradesh (population 75 million) which is home to an esti-
 mated 20% of India’s total population, 19.1% of women
 rural areas and 49.5% in urban had access to a phone
 that they themselves could use in 2015. 19 Beyond limita-
 tions in women’s phone access, Madhya Pradesh’s popu-
 lation health status falls below national level averages for
 most RMNCH indicators. In 2015, only 49.6% of women
 reported using any modern method for family planning
 and 12.1% reported having an unmet need for family
 planning. 19 While over half (53.0%) of pregnant women
 attended ANC clinics in the first trimester, only 35.7%
 received the recommended four ANC visits. 19 Despite
 high rates of institutional delivery (80.8%), only 54.9%
 of women and newborns received a postnatal health
 check within 2 days following birth. 19 Among children,
 34.4% were breastfed within 1 hour of birth and 58.2%
 were exclusively breastfed until 6 months of age. 19 One
 in four children (25.8%) were wasted (weight-­for-­height)
 and 42.0% were stunted (height-­ for-­ age). 19 Among
 children 12–23 months of age, 53.6% were fully immu-
 nised (Bacille Calmette-­ Guerin (BCG), measles and
 three doses each of polio and Diphtheria, Pertussis, and
 Tetanus (DPT)). 
<section> Figure 1 Summary of Kilkari content during pregnancy and up
 
<section> Intervention description
 Kilkari is comprised of 90 min of RMNCH content sent
 via 72 once weekly voice calls: 24 during pregnancy,
 within the first 6 months postpartum and 24 from 7 to
 12 months postpartum. Individual calls span an average
 of 77 s in duration and are framed as coming from ‘Dr
 Anita’. Across health content areas, 18% of cumulative
 call content is on family planning (benefits of family
 planning, modern reversible methods, sterilisation,
 pregnancy tests); 13% on child immunisations (diseases
 covered, doses); 13% on nutrition (malnutrition, growth
 monitoring, anaemia); 12% on infant feeding (quality of
 food, breast feeding, complementary feeding, anaemia);
 10% on pregnancy care (ANC, institutional delivery,
 rest, nutrition, tetanus toxoid, emergency services); 7%
 on entitlements; 7% on diarrhoea; 7% on postnatal care
 (newborn danger signs, cord care, hypothermia); and the
 remainder on a range of topics including intrapartum
 care, water and sanitation (WASH) and early childhood
 development (figure 1).
 The mobile numbers provided by women randomised
 to receive Kilkari began receiving calls no later than
 8 months (34 weeks) after conception, making them
 eligible for at least 57 of the 72 messages. The timing
 of RCT enrolment was intended to mirror the timing of
 enrolment to Kilkari elsewhere in India. Once subscribed,
 Kilkari used an algorithm to retry mobile numbers up to
 nine times—three times in each week—three times on
 to 1 year post partum. WASH, water and sanitation.

<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome of this study was the reported prac-
 tice of exclusive breast feeding for infants 0–6 months
 of age. The secondary outcome was the use of modern
 reversible contraceptive methods (including intrauterine
 contraceptive device (IUCD), injectables, oral contra-
 ceptive pills, emergency contraceptive pills, condoms)
 at 1 year post partum. The latter outcome was added
 after the trial registration but included in the published
 protocol. Three reasons underpin its inclusion. First,
 family planning messages constitute the largest overall
 message share (figure 1). Second, family planning calls
 occur throughout the extended postpartum window
 allowing for a large window of exposure to the intended
 messages. Third, the complexity of phone sharing prac-
 tices in this population means that men may be the actual
 listeners of some of the Kilkari calls. 20 Family planning
 represents includes behaviours which depend on both
 men and women both of whom may have been exposed
 to Kilkari calls. The outcome of immediate/early breast
 feeding noted in the trial registration was not emphasised
 as a primary or secondary outcome in our protocol. The
 study team felt that changes in these outcomes might be
 challenging to observe for two reasons. First, immediate/ 
<section> early breast feeding can be supply side dependent in the
 case of facility based and/or skilled attendant deliveries
 (which is why we reported it for normal deliveries and all
 deliveries) and thus, information provided to pregnant
 women is unlikely to move the indicator. Second, there
 are only two Kilkari messages (message 17: pregnancy
 month 8, week 1 and message 23: pregnancy month 9,
 week 3) which include content on early and immediate
 breast feeding.
 To assess the impact of Kilkari exposure on RMNCH
 outcomes, endline surveys were administered to enrolled
 women and their husbands after 12 months postpartum.
 The women’s endline survey included modules on
 RMNCH knowledge, practice, decision-­ making and
 demand for information and supply side services for
 the following health areas: pregnancy and delivery care,
 newborn care, child health, infant and young child
 feeding (IYCF), family planning, media consumption
 and reported demand for and receipt of health services
 from frontline health workers. The men’s survey sought
 to measure RMNCH knowledge; mobile phone owner-
 ship, use and literacy; and women’s access to phones.
 In addition to relying on respondent recall to answer
 survey questions, investigators also collected data from
 the participant’s Mother and Child Health card, which
 is issued to every pregnant woman at the local health
 facility and updated each visit and includes the child’s
 immunisation record.
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> To detect a 5% difference in the reported practices of
 exclusive breast feeding and reversible modern contra-
 ceptive use assuming an alpha of 0.05, 80% power, the
 estimated sample size for a two-­sample proportions test
 would be 3200 women. After adjusting for a design effect
 (variance inflation factor) of 1.25 due to clustering at
 the level of the Community Development Block (India’s
 subdistrict level administrative units), a 20% loss to
 follow-­up from enrolment to endline, and a potential
 loss of 35% of women due to poor reporting of phone
 numbers and/or changes to original phone numbers
 provided, a total of 5100 women were targeted for enrol-
 ment in the study. We assumed that 40% of women in
 the reproductive age would have access to a mobile
 phone in 2018 at the start of the study, and that 12.5%
 of households would have a pregnant woman between
 and 7 months, and thus anticipated needing to visit up to
 750 000 households across the four study districts.
 
<section> Enrolment of participants
 Study participants were identified through a household
 listing survey carried out from July to October 2018
 which included an intensive mapping of households
 and their residents and screened participants for eligi-
 bility. Women identified during the listing as meeting
 the eligibility criteria (Hindi speaking, 4–7 months preg-
 nant, with access to a mobile phone during the day)
 were screened again by a separate baseline survey team.
 Those confirmed to meet eligibility criteria were admin-
 istered a 1.5 hour baseline survey inclusive of modules on
 sociodemographic characteristics; phone ownership, use
 and digital competency; RMNCH knowledge and prac-
 tices. Following the baseline survey, study participants
 who completed the face to face survey and consented
 to receive Kilkari messages were randomised to receive
 Kilkari calls (intervention) or not receive messages
 (control). Exposure to Kilkari spanned through the
 child’s first birthday. Study participants were interviewed
 at 12 months post partum as part of endline survey activ-
 ities carried out from November 2020 to March 2021. No
 harms are anticipated for study participants enrolled to
 either study arm.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 The participants were randomised after stratification on
 a range of variables potentially associated with exposure
 (listening to messages) and likely to influence outcomes,
 including gestational age, parity, age of woman and
 ownership of phone. Stratification sought to ensure
 a balance of covariates between the intervention and
 control groups. The individual randomisation proce-
 dure was done on a block-­by-­block basis (block rando-
 misation) after enrolment was completed for each block.
 This ensured similar number of intervention and control
 subjects for each community development block. Rando-
 misation was performed by picking a random sample of
 participants for each Block using the sample command in
 Stata with the use of the above listed variables as stratifiers.
 The randomisation and allocation processes were carried
 out by the study investigators in late 2018 following the
 completion of baseline survey activities. The random
 sample picked was allocated to receive the intervention
 immediately after randomisation. The participants could
 not be blinded due to the nature of the intervention. The
 data collectors administering surveys were not aware of
 the allocation.
 
<section> Statistical methods
 To assess exposure to Kilkari content, call data records
 from the interactive voice response (IVR) system were
 linked to baseline and endline survey data. Listening
 patterns were assessed for each subscriber by call, for the
 duration of the their subscription to Kilkari. The content
 of the Kilkari calls was mapped to key health outcomes
 including knowledge and practice. Exposure was defined
 at a listening threshold of 50% or more of the cumula-
 tive duration of the calls mapped to the outcome. For
 example, 7 Kilkari calls (week 20, 24, 29, 34, 65, 66, 68)
 included content on reversible modern contraceptive
 methods, for a total of 10.5 min of audio content on this
 topic (online supplemental table 1). To be ‘exposed’
 subscribers would have had to listen to 50% or more
 of the cumulative message total of these messages, for
 example, 5 min or more of the contents.
 Primary analyses of outcomes were done with modified
 intention-­to-­treat (ITT) analyses at the individual level 
<section> so that outcomes were analysed regardless of the degree
 of listening to Kilkari. The term modified refers to the
 requirement of being able to determine the outcomes
 beyond 1 year of the postpartum period (ie, only those
 who were reached by the endline survey were included
 in the analysis). Relative risk (RR) for primary and
 secondary outcomes was calculated for the interven-
 tion group compared with the control group using log-­
 binomial regression with general estimating equations to
 account for correlation within villages.
 To assess the impact of exposure on outcomes, compli-
 ance adjusted treatment effects were additionally gener-
 ated using the instrumental variable (IV) methodology.
 The study arm based on randomisation was considered
 the instrument variable. As noted above, exposure was
 defined as listening to at least 50% of the cumulative
 duration of the calls mapped to the outcome. RR esti-
 mates were calculated using log binomial models for each
 outcome with adjustment for clustering at the village
 level. The IV analysis was carried out using the IVREG
 package in R. 21 Frequencies and proportions are used
 to describe differences across intervention and control
 groups (ITT) as well as those exposed to 50% or more of
 Kilkari content.
 
<section> Role of the funding source
 The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had no role in
 the study design; collection, analysis and interpretation
 of data; in the writing of the report; or in the decision
 to submit the paper for publication. All authors confirm
 that they had full access to all the data in the study and
 accept responsibility for the publication submitted.
 
<section> Patient and public involvement
 Patients were first engaged on identification in their
 households as part of a household listing carried out in
 mid/late 2018. Those meeting eligibility criteria were
 interviewed as part of the baseline survey, and ultimately
 randomised to the intervention and control arms. Prior
 to the administration of the baseline, a small number
 of patients were involved in the refinement of survey
 tools through qualitative interviews, including cognitive
 interviews, which were carried out to optimise survey
 questions, including the language and translation used.
 Finalised tools were administered to patients at baseline
 and endline, and for a subsample of the study popula-
 tion, additional interviews carried out over the phone
 and via qualitative interviews between the baseline and
 endline surveys. Unfortunately because of COVID-­
 and associated travel restrictions, patients could not be
 involved in the dissemination of study findings. However,
 public dissemination of the results has occurred through
 a number of global level presentations.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Sample characteristics
 Among the 5095 women enrolled at baseline, 2695 were
 randomised to the intervention arm and 2400 to the
 control arm (figure 2). An estimated 95% (n=2559) of
 the mobile numbers provided by women randomised to
 the intervention arm received at least 1 Kilkari call that
 was answered. Table 1 shows the characteristics for the
 ITT population of women (n=5095) enrolled at baseline
 and their husbands (n=3842) interviewed at endline.
 
<section> Exposure to Kilkari calls
 The mobile numbers provided by those randomised to
 the intervention arm began receiving Kilkari calls no
 later than the first week of the eighth month of their
 pregnancy (Kilkari weekly call 17). Successful calls are
 those that reach the handset and are answered. We
 cannot identify who answered the call. Figure 3 depicts
 the number and duration of successful calls for each of
 the Kilkari calls among the mobile numbers provided by
 those randomised to the intervention arm. As denoted by
 the orange bars, the number of successful calls peaked at
 Kilkari call 22 (pregnancy month 9, week 2) and declined
 gradually from call 25 (baby month 1, week 1) to
 (baby month 4, week 2). Declines in successful calls were
 attributed primarily to deactivations as a result of adverse
 events (miscarriage, death, stillbirths), SIM change and
 increases in call non-­delivery rates. From the timing of
 the baseline survey to 12 months postpartum when the
 endline survey occurred, 44% of women enrolled into
 RCT changed their SIM cards and thus were no longer
 receiving Kilkari calls. Women who retained the same
 SIM card from baseline to endline tended to be more
 educated, within the higher socioeconomic strata,
 and advantaged caste groups. Call non-­ delivery rates
 increased throughout 2018 and were underpinned by the
 bankruptcy of Reliance communications, one of India’s
 leading mobile network providers.
 High listenership, depicted by the black and blue hori-
 zontal lines in figure 3, is defined as the proportion of
 subscribers who listened to at least 50% and 75%, respec-
 tively, of the total content of an individual call. Across
 individual Kilkari calls, high listenership rates were stable
 over time, ranging from 45% to 65% among successful
 calls. An average of 65% of subscribers listened to more
 than 50% of the cumulative total of successful calls while
 31% listened to more than 75% of the total content of
 calls. The odds of listening to 50% or more of the cumu-
 lative content were greater among those enrolled earlier
 in pregnancy, with the same phone number from base-
 line to endline surveys, and with double digit numeracy
 (online supplemental figure 1).
 The Kilkari programme’s algorithm that keeps calling
 subscribers who do not answer up to nine times each
 week increased the proportion of successful calls, espe-
 cially among subscribers in the most marginalised
 demographic groups (figure 4). On average, seven
 call attempts were needed to reach subscribers in the
 poorest socioeconomic strata as compared with four
 attempts needed to reach those in the higher (middle,
 richer and richest) socioeconomic strata. Across ethnic
 groups, seven call attempts were needed on average to

 were driven by significantly higher use of condoms (ITT,
 RR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23, p=0.024) and a marginally
 significant increase in the use of oral contraceptive pills
 (ITT, RR: 1.28, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.69, p=0.088). Subgroup
 analyses suggest that absolute differences in reversible
 method use between those exposed to Kilkari and those
 not exposed were highest for those with any male child
 (9.9% difference), in the lowest three socioeconomic
 strata (difference of 15.8% difference in the poorest,
 8.8% in poorer and 6.7% in poor), and in scheduled

 In addition to differences in the use of modern revers-
 ible contraceptive methods, the proportion of men or
 women sterilised since the birth of the child was 2.0%
 lower in the intervention arm (12.9%) than reported in
 the control arm (14.9%). Findings were significant across
 study arms (ITT, RR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.97, p=0.016)

<section> Effects on other RMNCH practices
 Table 3 presents impact findings for a range of other
 RMNCH practices, including facility delivery, essential
 newborn care, WASH and childhood immunisations.
 Findings suggest that the proportion of children immu-
 nised at 10 weeks was 2.8% higher in the intervention arm
 as compared with the control arm (ITT, RR: 1.04, 95% CI
 1.00 to 1.07, p=0.048). Significant differences were not
 observed for other RMNCH practices assessed. Subgroup
 analysis found that differences in the proportion of chil-
 dren fully immunised at 12 months were higher among
 women exposed to Kilkari who had no schooling (differ-
 ence of 15.2% across exposed vs not exposed groups)
 or primary school completed (difference of 9.9%) as
 compared with those with secondary school education or
 higher (difference of 1.4%) (online supplemental tables
 2A–C). A similar trend was observed for immunisations at
 birth, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks.
 
<section> Effects on knowledge, decision-making, discussion, demand,
 
<section> supply
 
<section> Tables 4–6 and online supplemental tables 3A,B and 4A,B
 present data on differences in women and men’s knowl-
 edge, decision-­making, reported discussion, demand for
 and receipt of health information for RMNCH outcomes
 assessed. ITT findings suggest that the proportion of
 women (RR: 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.07, p<0.001) and
 men (RR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.09, p=0.032) who know
 to ask a health provider questions about family planning
 use was higher among those in the intervention arm
 compared with those in the control arm (table 2). This
 corresponds to a 3.4% and 3.0% difference across study
 arms for women and men, respectively. Similarly, both
 ITT (RR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11, p=0.032) and IV (RR:
 1.24, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.53, p=0.044) findings suggest that
 women subscribed to Kilkari were more likely to know
 that they could obtain a pregnancy test from Accred-
 ited Social Health Activities, the Government of India’s
 community health worker cadre (table 5). Among a range
 of outcomes assessed on decision-­ making, discussion,
 demand and receipt of information, Kilkari was associ-
 ated with an increased likelihood of women’s involvement
 in the decision-­making on when to start giving their chil-
 dren complementary food (ITT RR: 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to
 1.06, p=0.041; IV RR: 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.24, p=0.042)
 (table 3). This corresponds to a 2.8% difference across
 study arms for women. Significant differences were not
 observed for other intermediate outcomes assessed.

 of RMNCH outcomes. Kilkari was not significantly asso-
 ciated with significant improvements in infant feeding
 practices, including the primary outcome of exclusive
 breast feeding. A significant increase was observed in
 the use of modern reversible contraceptive methods,
 particularly among those women exposed to Kilkari with
 any male child, in the poorest socioeconomic strata,
 and in disadvantaged ethnic groups. Increases in revers-
 ible method use were driven principally by increases
 in condom and oral contraceptive use, and occurred
 concurrently with a significant decrease in the propor-
 tion of men or women sterilised since the birth of the
 child. Increases in the proportion of children immunised
 at 10 weeks and the proportion of women involved in
 decision-­making on when to introduce complementary
 foods were also observed. Significant improvements in
 other RMNCH outcomes were not observed. Findings
 suggest that an average of 65% of subscribers listened to
 more than 50% of the cumulative total of successful calls
 while 31% listened to more than 75% of the total content
 of calls. High listenership rates were stable over time;
 a likely indication that if calls reach the mobile device
 and are answered, subscribers tend to the listen to them.
 Analyses of the programme’s algorithm that attempts to
 call subscribers up to nine times to yield a successful call
 found that a greater number of call attempts are needed
 to reach the most marginalised.
 Kilkari includes health information content across
 more than 11 health areas. The theory of change under-
 pinning the evaluation is published elsewhere. 17 Infant
 feeding outcomes were selected as the priority outcomes
 from the outset because they represent a sizeable share

<section> of message content (12%) and the practice of these
 behaviours is not supply side dependent, although imme-
 diate breast feeding can be. In the case of exclusive
 breast feeding, the low (58%) pretrial prevalence of this
 behaviour additionally left much potential for improve-
 ment. 19 In practice, significant improvements were not
 observed in exclusive breast feeding. Qualitative research
 findings published elsewhere help to shed light on the
 factors underpinning these results. 23 Kilkari messages
 that told women to give only breastmilk were interpreted
 to mean ‘give only breastmilk as the main source of
 nutrition’—since janam ghutti (a local term referring to
 homemade or indigenous herbal tonic), water and the
 provision of small quantities of sweets were not a source
 of nutrition, giving them to babies was not considered by
 caregivers to be incompatible with following the message
 to exclusively breastfeed. 23 When Kilkari did specify not
 to give ghutti or other food items, women often did not
 seem to absorb this from the message. 23 Broadly, women
 did not see valid reasons to stop giving substances such as
 ghutti which they thought helped to support the child’s
 health and in instances of illness could prevent worse
 illness. While quantitative survey findings did indicate
 a significant increase in the proportion of the mothers
 involved in decision-­ making over when to introduce
 complementary foods, mothers were also not the sole
 decision-­makers and families too felt strongly that ghutti,
 water and other substances were helpful for babies.
 Women also reported appreciating and trusting the
 advice of elders who encouraged giving ghutti and other
 substances. Specific to the practice of breast feeding,
 most women in rural Madhya Pradesh reported having
 very limited support to exclusively breastfeed, including
 refrigeration, consistent electricity supply, pumping and
 bottle sterilisation, as well as support to solve physiolog-
 ical issues that may interfere with breast feeding. In sum,
 complex behaviours that have competing social norms
 and are currently seen to work quite well are challenging
 to change and receiving a small number of Kilkari voice
 calls advocating that one adopt a particular practice did
 not catalyse a change in behaviour.
 From a measurement perspective, qualitative findings
 affirmed those from cognitive interviews done to support
 the design of survey tools. 24 25 While the National Family
 Health Survey-­4 findings from 2015 to 16 suggest that the
 reported practice of exclusive breast feeding was 58% in
 Madhya Pradesh, our findings suggest a much lower prev-
 alence (intervention: 10.8%; control: 10.4%) when addi-
 tional probing questions are incorporated in the survey
 tool. Discrepancies lie the wording of survey questions
 and indicator framing. Our estimates of exclusive breast
 feeding are based on two questions in contrast to other
 surveys: (1) women who reported practicing exclusive
 breast feeding in the first 6 months of their child’s life
 and (2) women who report never having fed their child
 janam ghutti, water, honey, animal milk, formula milk,
 jaifal or tea in the first 6 months of life. Across study arms,
 only 10.8% of women in the intervention arm and 10.4%

 the largest overall content area (18%) and were provided
 throughout the extended postpartum window. The
 impact on modern reversible contraceptive use was
 driven by increases in condom use and oral contracep-
 tives, and as noted above, occurred concurrently with
 a decrease in sterilisation. A multitude of factors may
 explain these results. First, 49% of women in our sample
 reported sharing mobile phones and among women who
 did not own their own phones (25%), it was often their
 husbands who listened to Kilkari calls. 23 Exposure to 
<section> Kilkari calls among men may thus have catalysed some of
 the increase observed. Second, the study population was
 characterised by high economic migration among men; a
 factor which too may have influenced women’s decision-­
 making on method preferences and the observed shift
 from permanent to reversible methods. Lastly, increases
 were significantly higher among subgroups including
 those with any male children. Given social norms around
 gender preferences for children, Kilkari may have served
 as a ‘tipping point’ to prompt behaviour change among
 those who had already had a male child. Indeed, qualita-
 tive findings suggest that men and women retained and
 appreciated Kilkari messages that aligned with their pre-­
 existing worldviews, social norms and existing practices
 but overlooked or de-­emphasised content that did not.
 
<section> Comparison with findings elsewhere
 Our study is the largest effectiveness trial conducted glob-
 ally to date of a mHealth messaging programme oper-
 ating at scale. Comparable RCTs of mHealth messaging
 programmes in other low resource settings were
 completed as part of pilot studies or smaller deployments
 in Africa. 8–11 The changes in programme features and
 design which frequently occur as programmes transition
 from small scale pilots to large scale deployments can
 lead to a voltage drop in their effectiveness at scale and
 have implications for the generalisibiltiy of results. 2 15 By
 starting with a programme already firmly established and
 scaled, we have sought to improve emerging evidence on
 the generalisability of such interventions. By recruiting
 study participants directly from their communities, we
 have sought to test the intervention under ‘imperfect’
 real world conditions ensuring that findings are gener-
 alisable to and representative of the population at large
 with access to mobile phones. Further efforts to power
 the sampling frame to detect a 5% difference across study
 arms in the primary outcomes of reversible contraceptive
 method use and exclusive breast feeding sought to ensure
 that modest differences in outcomes would be detected.
 While challenges with exposure exceeded expectations
 (and are discussed below), subgroup analyses on key
 population subgroups were particularly critical to under-
 standing the differential effect programme activities
 may have had. Elsewhere we continue to explore equity
 considerations in greater depth. 22 Analyses of call data
 records made possible by MOHFW and with the support
 of technical partners including BBC Media Action,
 Beehyv and IMI Mobile were integral to our efforts to
 determine exposure to specific subsets of Kilkari messages
 by outcome and explore linkages between dosage of
 listening and reported health outcomes. Ours is the first
 evaluation of a mHealth messaging programme to make
 this link.
 The RCT presented here is part of a large mixed
 methods evaluation of Kilkari. 17 Findings add to the
 limited evidence available on the effectiveness of large-­
 scale health information messaging programmes 4 7
 and smaller scale initiatives in Malawi 8 and Zanzibar. 9–11
 
<section> However, comparisons with other programmes are chal-
 lenging given the fundamental differences in programme
 components, implementation partners, study contexts,
 scale of implementation and evaluation design. Kilkari
 was designed as an integrated component of a suite of
 mHealth services that involved training of frontline
 health workers (Mobile Academy), equipping them
 with job aids (Mobile Kunji), and reinforcing health
 information provided to beneficiaries through contacts
 with the public health system (Kilkari). 2 16 However, the
 programme was ultimately scaled as a standalone service
 with key features, including the timing of calls, modi-
 fied based on what was feasible to implement at scale.
 By comparison, programmes in Bangladesh, Malawi,
 Zanzibar and elsewhere in India, all feature mHealth
 information messaging as part of a larger suite of services,
 often enabled by frontline health workers who provide
 face-­ to-­ face communication services, supported by an
 implementing non-­government organisation with donor
 funding. The sole exception is South African National
 Department of Health’s MomConnect programme which
 does include a HelpDesk 27 component but principally
 is centred around the delivery of 145 twice weekly text
 messages to new and expectant mothers.
 Globally, the future of mHealth messaging programmes
 remains uncertain. While several programmes have
 scaled to reach large numbers of subscribers, 4–7 28 sustain-
 ability remains a continued challenge. While a number
 of factors underpin this, key drivers include dependency
 on donor funding, limited government capacity for over-
 sight and stewardship, and lack of evidence on impact
 and value for money. 13 The emergence of COVID-­
 has further increased demands on already finite health
 resources. Despite the uncertainties, programmes like
 Kilkari, which have the infrastructure in place to send
 health information content out to millions of benefi-
 ciaries, offer much potential for delivering other kinds
 of health information, including information related to
 COVID-­19. More broadly, our findings underscore the
 potential impact mHealth messaging programmes may
 have in providing women and their families with access
 to health information. By not restricting the framing of
 Kilkari messages to women, the programme may have
 tapped into a demand among men for health informa-
 tion. Further, efforts to ensure that Kilkari content was
 accessible regardless of subscribers’ education, caste or
 socioeconomic status, may underpin pro-­poor findings
 observed for reversible contraceptive method use. Long-­
 standing social norms, particularly those around son
 preference, are challenging to change. However, efforts
 to differentially target key population segments whom we
 know services are likely to impact the most may be one
 future avenue to explore.
 
<section> Limitations
 
<section> Evaluation activities have several notable limitations.
 When compared with pregnant women at a population,
 our sample of women with access to a mobile phone 
<section> during the day is likely more advantaged; a structural bias
 most mHealth initiatives face. However, when compared
 against women enrolled to the Kilkari programme else-
 where in India, the RCT sample may be different for
 two reasons. First, our RCT sample was identified via a
 household listing and screening survey where an esti-
 mated 50% of the pregnant women at a population level
 were eligible since they had access to a phone during the
 day. This exceeds the average population level coverage
 attained by Kilkari across 13 states in India (21%) and
 elsewhere in Madhya Pradesh (18%) which identifies
 subscribers passively through government tracking regis-
 tries. Our RCT thus included a higher proportion of the
 population by including women who would not neces-
 sarily have been registered in the government’s tracking
 registry. 29 The RCT faced challenges in ensuring contin-
 uous exposure to Kilkari messages among those in the
 intervention arm as a result of high rates of SIM change
 (44%), male population migration (potentially with their
 phones; 25% of men could not be interviewed as part
 of the endline survey), and increases in call non-­delivery
 rates attributed to the bankruptcy of the telecommu-
 nications provider for the Kilkari programme, in mid-­
 2018. All of these factors exceeded initial expectations
 and resulted in a loss of power due to lower compliance
 and programme exposure. A third limitation of the
 study lies in our reliance on self-­reported outcomes for
 all outcomes except immunisations, many of which may
 be subject to social desirability bias. A fourth limitation
 lies in the information and recall biases associated with
 collecting data on practices occurring over a long window
 at a single time point (12 months postpartum). Addition-
 ally, we were not able to measure outcomes related to self-­
 efficacy to practice RMNCH behaviours. Lastly, there may
 be unmeasured confounders but we assume the rando-
 misation process distributed them evenly across the two
 arms.
 
<section> CONCLUSIONS
 Study findings provide the most conclusive evidence to
 date on the effectiveness of a mHealth messaging initia-
 tive at scale in India and globally. The moderate impact
 observed on modern reversible contraceptive method
 use, particularly among the most marginalised, is prom-
 ising while the lack of any measurable changes in infant
 feeding behaviours is disappointing. Further research
 is needed to understand whether the impact might be
 deepened through microtargeting-­ specific subsets of
 the beneficiary population with tailored programme
 content; by changing the number of messages and the
 duration of the service; and by complementing Kilkari
 with supplementary face to face communication to create
 an enabling environment more supportive of behaviour
 change.
