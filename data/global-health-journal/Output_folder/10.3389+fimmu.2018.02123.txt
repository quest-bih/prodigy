 The iron homeostasis disorders consist in the up-expression
 of hepcidin and the subsequent down-regulation of Fpn leading
 to anemia of inflammation (AI), a pathological condition
 characterized by low hematological parameters, normal-to-
 elevated sFtn, high levels of IL-6 and of other pro-inflammatory
 cytokines (22). These disorders are traditionally treated with
 iron supplementations. However, in papers by Paesano et al.
 (4) and Rosa et al. (23) the iron homeostasis disorders have
 not been defined as iron deficiency but as iron delocalization,
 characterized by iron overload in tissues/secretions and iron
 deficiency in blood. In a pathological condition occurring
 in patients affected by β-thalassemia, one of the types of
 thalassemia caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene (HBB)
 on chromosome 11, hepcidin production is suppressed (5, 20).
 The phenotypes of β-thalassemias include β-thalassemia major,
 intermedia and minor, according to the severity of the genetic
 mutation. Individuals with β-thalassemia major, characterized by
 marked ineffective erythropoiesis and severe hemolysis, as well as
 with β-thalassemia intermedia, characterized by widely variable
 symptoms and severity ranging between the two extremes of
 the major and minor forms, require frequent to occasional
 RBCs transfusions to sustain life (24–26). Among β-thalassemic
 (27, 28), the subjects affected by minor β-thalassemia, clinically
 asymptomatic and characterized by morphological abnormalities
 of erythrocytes as well as by a slight lowering of the hemoglobin
 levels, show the disorders of iron homeostasis sometimes leading
 to a mild anemia (24). During pregnancy, despite the progress
 of therapies, maternal and fetal complications, such as risk of
 abortion, thromboembolism, pre-term delivery and intrauterine
 growth restriction, appear to be increased in patients with β-
 thalassemia major, occurring in almost 40% of pregnancies, as
 well as in patients with β-thalassemia intermedia, occurring in
 20–30% of pregnancies, compared to healthy ones (25, 26).
 Regarding β-thalassemia minor, the incidence of premature and
 low birth weight infants was found to be comparable to the
 general population. Of note, there is no specific therapy for β-
 thalassemia minor subjects during pregnancy, but if the anemia
 becomes more severe transfusions are sometimes necessary (25,
 26).
 Concerning the other pathology treated in this study, the
 hereditary thrombophilia (HT), there are no data in literature on
 the correlation between hepcidin levels and the establishing of AI
 in HT subjects. However, higher levels of serum IL-6 compared
 to healthy subjects have been described in HT pregnant women
 (29). HT is a genetic predisposition to the formation of venous 
<section> thrombus due to coagulation abnormalities (30, 31). During
 pregnancy, this hypercoagulable state is exacerbated due to the
 increase of factors VII, VIII, X and von Willebrand factor
 activities and to marked increases in fibrinogen (32). Thrombin
 generation markers such as prothrombin F1 and F2 also
 increase (33). Moreover, activation of the coagulation system is
 characterized by the co-participation of inflammatory response
 components as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α (34). All these changes can
 predispose to several maternal and fetal complications during
 the pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia, late and recurrent
 early miscarriage, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction
 (FGR), and intrauterine death and stillbirth (33). For all
 these reasons, in order to avoid maternal and fetal sequelae,
 all HT pregnant women must undergo a proper therapeutic
 management.
 An important component of iron and inflammatory
 homeostasis machinery is an iron binding glycoprotein, named
 lactoferrin (Lf), present in human secretions, like milk, saliva,
 vaginal fluid, amniotic fluid, upper airway fluid, seminal plasma,
 the cervical mucus, and earwax (23). Similar to proteins of
 the secretions, Lf is a multifunctional glycoprotein able to
 protect mucosa from the injury of microbial attachment and
 colonization as well as to exert anti-inflammatory activity
 (18, 35). The bovine milk derivative lactoferrin (bLf), generally
 recognized as safe (GRAS) by Food and Drug Administration
 (FDA-USA), is emerging as an important natural glycoprotein
 able to treat IDA and AI (4, 29, 36–38). The efficacy of bLf
 treatment is related to its ability to decrease IL-6 concentration
 which, in turn, modulates hepcidin and Fpn synthesis. Recent
 in vitro studies showed how high levels of IL-6 down-
 regulate the expression of Fpn in inflamed-macrophages
 and how bLf is able to efficiently revert this effect, down-
 regulating IL-6 and up-regulating Fpn (8, 9). These results
 demonstrate that bLf, able to decrease IL-6 levels, exerts a
 role in iron and inflammatory homeostasis and, especially, in
 treating AI.
 Of note, previous in vivo studies have reported non-pregnant
 women affected by minor β-thalassemia to possess higher levels
 of IL-6 compared with non-pregnant healthy women (38).
 Conversely, pregnant women suffering of minor β-thalassemia
 have been found to possess higher, but not-significant, levels
 of IL-6 compared with healthy pregnancies (38). Regarding HT
 pregnant and non-pregnant women, they have been described
 with higher levels of IL-6 compared with healthy pregnancies
 
<section> (29, 38).
 Here, we present the data on the efficacy of bLf oral
 administration in treating anemia in minor β-thalassemic
 pregnant and non-pregnant women as well as in the management
 of AI in pregnant and non-pregnant women affected by HT. The
 bLf efficacy is also reported in pregnant women suffering from
 other pathologies.
 Remarkably, for the first time, we demonstrate that the
 efficacy of bLf in treating anemia and AI in β-thalassemic
 and HT women, respectively, can be correlated, in addition
 to the decrease to the IL-6, with two potential different
 molecular mechanisms: hepcidin-independent for β-thalassemic
 and hepcidin-dependent for HT women.
 
<section> MATERIALS AND METHODS
 
<section> Study Design
 To compare the efficacy of bLf treatment vs. the Italian ferrous
 sulfate one, usually applied worldwide as standard treatment, in
 the management of anemia and AI in pregnant and non-pregnant
 women affected by minor β-thalassemia and HT, respectively, a
 monocentric interventional clinical study has been conducted.
 In addition, the efficacy of bLf oral administration was also
 carried out on anemic pregnant women suffering from different
 pathologies as epilepsy, insulin resistance diabetes type 2, Crohn’s
 disease, hypertension and HT (twin pregnancies).
 
<section> Setting
 
<section> The interventional clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
 NCT01221844) has been conducted at Clinica Fabia Mater, via
 Olevano Romano 25, Rome, Italy, a secondary-level hospital
 for complicated pregnancies, in accordance with the ethical
 principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical
 Practice. Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of
 Clinica Fabia Mater, via Olevano Romano 25, Rome, Italy (FM
 MOD 26022010). All women gave written informed consent
 before undergoing any study procedure. All women have been
 recruited from June 2010 to October 2013. All pregnant women
 were examined at the time of enrolment and every 30 days at
 the scheduled visits until delivery. All women of child-bearing
 age were examined at the time of enrolment and 30 days after
 treatments.
 
<section> Patients
 
<section> A total of 90 anemic pregnant women between the 6th and 8th
 week of gestation has been enrolled, thereof 20 women with
 minor β-thalassemia and 70 with HT, and 20 anemic affected by
 other pathologies, including epilepsy (No 9), insulin resistance
 diabetes type 2 (No 3), Crohn’s disease (No 3), hypertension
 (No 2), and HT twin pregnancies (No 3), enrolled at different
 weeks of gestation.
 Pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancy were
 excluded as well as if smokers or if they had anti-phospholipid
 syndrome, other concomitant diseases, infections, previous
 iron supplementation therapy, recent blood transfusion(s),
 obesity, and allergy to milk proteins, factors that could be
 considered potential modifiers of the treatments. In addition,
 this interventional clinical study included 88 anemic women of
 child-bearing age, thereof 9 affected by minor β-thalassemia and
 
<section> 79 by HT.
 Non-pregnant women were excluded if smokers or if
 they had other concomitant diseases, infections, previous iron
 supplementation therapy, recent blood transfusion(s), obesity
 and allergy to milk proteins.
 All enrolled HT pregnant and non-pregnant women received
 low molecular-weight heparin (0.3 U/day of Seleparina,
 Italfarmaco SpA, Milano-Italy) and low dose aspirin (100 mg
 every 2 days of Cardioaspirin R 100, Bayer SpA, Milano-Italy)
 to prevent and reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and
 miscarriage associated to hypercoagulability (39). 
<section> Blood Analyses
 Each blood sample was harvested, aliquoted, and stored at
 
<section> −80 ◦ C in order to analyze the parameters at different times.
 The anemia is defined when one of the hematological parameters
 corresponded to the following values: RBCs <4,000,000/ml, Hb
 
<section> <11 g/dl, TSI <30 µg/dl, and sFtn <12 ng/ml.
 The diagnosis of β-thalassemia was carried out, at the
 laboratory of Clinica Fabia Mater, by the analysis of the
 hematological parameters including red cell morphology and
 indices that revealed microcytosis (low mean corpuscular
 volume, MCV), reduced content of Hb per red cell (low mean
 corpuscular hemoglobin, MCH), followed by separation and
 measurement of Hb fractions through electrophoresis (40).
 Moreover, TSI and sFtn were assessed from venous blood.
 In particular, TSI was measured using an Iron FZ assay
 (Hoffmann-LaRoche, Basel, Switzerland) based on a guanidine
 hydrochloride/Ferrozine reaction, while sFtn was measured
 using a radioimmunoassay (Spectria, Orion Diagnostics). Serum
 IL-6 and hepcidin were also detected. Serum IL-6 levels
 were determined by standard ELISA Quantitative kits (R&D
 Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) at Department of Public Health
 and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy,
 on the samples collected before and after treatment. Serum
 hepcidin was detected according to competitive enzyme-linked
 immunosorbent assay (Intrinsic Life Sciences, La Jolla, CA) at
 Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza
 University of Rome, Italy.
 The diagnosis of HT was performed at Institute Regina Elena,
 Department of Medical Pathology, Rome, Italy according to
 Jackson et al. (41). In particular, pregnant women with a history
 of adverse outcomes including recurrent miscarriages, preterm
 birth, intrauterine growth restriction, were screened for the
 following HT markers before the enrolment: protein C, protein
 S, activated protein C resistance, antithrombin deficiencies,
 elevated coagulation factors, hyperhomocysteinemia, F5 R506Q
 (factor V Leiden) and F2 G20210A (prothrombin G20210A)
 mutations. When at least one of these HT markers was found,
 pregnant women were considered affected by HT. All HT women
 were further screened for hematological parameters as RBCs, Hb,
 TSI, and sFtn as well as for serum IL-6 and serum hepcidin before
 starting and after 30 days of the treatments.
 Moreover, for all enrolled women, the values of hematocrit,
 glycemia, uricemia, bilirubin, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase,
 glutamic pyruvic transaminase, cholesterol, triglyceride acid, and
 electrolytes were evaluated at each visit (data not shown).
 
<section> Clinical Examination
 To evaluate the putative adverse effects of the treatments
 in pregnant women, the main outcomes were based on the
 estimation of maternal gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea,
 vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.
 At each visit, fetal vital sign assessments were monitored
 by ultrasonographic measurements of intrauterine growth
 and through the amount of amniotic fluid, expressed
 as amniotic fluid index (AFI), an index for the fetal
 well-being (42). An AFI of ≤5 cm was considered
 oligohydramnios, 5–8 cm borderline, and from 8 to 24 cm
 normal (42).
 At the delivery, new-born weight and the APGAR score
 were also registered. The APGAR score is a practical method
 to evaluate the physical condition of a new-born shortly after
 delivery. The Apgar score comprises five components: (1) color,
 (2) heart rate, (3) reflexes, (4) muscle tone, and (5) respiration,
 each of which is given a score of 0, 1, or 2. An APGAR score
 of 0–3 at 5–10 min of age is predictive of high morbidity and
 mortality, a score of 4–6 as moderately abnormal, while a value
 of 9–10 indicates that the infant is in the best possible condition.
 The adverse effects in women of child-bearing age were
 evaluated by gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting,
 diarrhea and constipation.
 
<section> Interventions
 Pregnant and child-bearing age women affected by minor β-
 thalassemia and HT suffering from anemia and AI, respectively,
 were assigned to different Arms on the basis of a personal
 preference. As matter of fact, before starting the study patients
 choose by themselves which treatment to adhere to.
 Women included in Arm A, C, E, and G received the
 treatment based on the oral administration of one capsule
 containing 100 mg of bLf plus excipients (Lattoglobina R , Italy)
 two times a day before meals, to avoid the protein degradation
 due to the low pH of gastric juice during digestion (about
 1.5). Conversely, at pH about 4, characteristic of gastric juice
 before meals, 90% of the administered bLf arrives undigested
 to the intestine (43). The total amount of elemental iron
 supplied by Lattoglobina R capsules corresponded to about 70–
 
<section> 84 µg/day, depending on the degree of iron saturation (20–
 30%). Women included in Arm B, D, F, and H received the
 standard treatment based on the oral administration of a tablet
 containing 329.7 mg of ferrous sulfate (Ferro-Grad R , Abbot
 Laboratories, USA) once a day during meal, in order to avoid
 a possible gastric intolerance of the drug, according to the
 Italian Standard of Care. The total amount of elemental iron
 supplied by Ferro-Grad R tablets corresponded to about
 mg/day.
 All pregnant women affected by different pathologies,
 previously described, received oral administration of one capsule
 containing 100 mg of bLf plus excipients (Lattoglobina R ,
 Italy) twice a day before meals, while HT women with twin
 pregnancies three times a day, more efficient in increasing
 hematological parameters than the administration of bLf twice
 a day.
 
<section> Further Laboratory Analysis
 The purity of the encapsulated bLf (Molecular Weight of about
 80 kDa) was checked by SDS-PAGE and silver nitrate staining,
 while its concentration was assessed by UV spectroscopy on the
 basis of an extinction coefficient of 15.1 (280 nm, 1% solution).
 The bLf iron saturation was about 20–30% as detected by
 optical spectroscopy at 468 nm on the basis of an extinction
 coefficient of 0.54 (100% iron saturation, 1% solution). The
 total amount of elemental iron supplied by Lattoglobina R
 capsules corresponded to about 70–84 µg/day, depending on

 the degree of iron saturation (20–30%). LPS contamination of
 bLf, estimated by Limulus Amebocyte assay (Pyrochrome kit,
 PBI International), was equal to 0.7 ± 0.06 ng/mg of bLf (9,
 43).
 
<section> Statistical Analysis
 Statistical analysis was carried out using the ANOVA test. P-
 values has been obtained comparing before and after 30 days of
 each treatment the number of RBCs, the concentration of Hb,
 TSI, sFtn, IL-6 and hepcidin.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Demographics
 A total of 20 minor β-thalassemic and 70 HT pregnant women
 suffering from anemia and AI, respectively, was enrolled in
 the interventional clinical trial within the first trimester of
 pregnancy (Figures 1A,B). On the basis of their personal
 preference, 12 and 8 minor β-thalassemic pregnant women
 were included in Arm A (bLf intervention) and Arm B
 (ferrous sulfate intervention), respectively (Figure 1A). Among
 
<section> 8 minor β-thalassemic pregnant women belonging to Arm B,
 withdrew the study for adverse effects (diarrhea) (Figure 1A).
 
<section> Regarding HT pregnant women, on the basis of their personal
 preference, 40 were included in Arm C (bLf intervention)
 and 30 in Arm D (ferrous sulfate intervention) (Figure 1B).
 
<section> Among 30 HT pregnant women belonging to Arm D,
 withdrew the study for adverse effects: 2 for gastrointestinal
 discomfort and 3 for diarrhea (Figure 1B). Demographics and
 hematological parameters of minor β-thalassemic and HT
 pregnant women, who completed the study, are reported in
 
<section> Table 1.
 
<section> Moreover, 20 anemic pregnant women suffering from
 other pathologies, including epilepsy (No 9), insulin
 resistance diabetes type 2 (No 3), Crohn’s disease (No 3),
 hypertension (No 2) and HT with twin pregnancies (No 3),
 have been enrolled at different trimesters of pregnancy
 and exclusively treated with bLf oral administration.
 Demographics as well as Hb and TSI values are reported in
 
<section> Table 2.
 
<section> A total of 9 minor β-thalassemic and 79 HT women of child-

 E (No 5, bLf intervention) and Arm F (No 4, ferrous sulfate
 intervention), respectively, and completed the study (Figure 1C).
 
<section> Regarding HT women of child-bearing age, on the basis of
 their personal preference, 41 were included in Arm G (bLf
 intervention) and 38 in Arm H (ferrous sulfate intervention)
 (Figure 1D). Among 38 HT women belonging to Arm H,

<section> Anemia and AI
 In pregnant women suffering from minor β-thalassemia and
 HT, the RBCs, Hb, TSI, sFtn, serum IL-6, and hepcidin were
 assessed before and every 30 days of treatments until delivery.
 The results obtained after the first 30 days of both interventions
 and at delivery, independently from the week of the gestation,
 are presented in the 
<section> Tables 4, 5 for minor β-thalassemic and in
 
<section> Tables 6, 7 for HT pregnant women, respectively.
 As shown in 
<section> Table 4, minor β-thalassemic pregnant women
 treated for 30 days with bLf (Arm A) showed a significant
 increase of Hb (from 7.8 ± 1.3 to 11.7 ± 0.8 g/dl) as well as a
 signficant decrease of IL-6 (from 25 ± 8 to 6 ± 3 pg/ml). Of note,
 a remarkable increase of TSI (from 54 ± 17 to 80 ± 9 µg/dl)
 was also observed. Conversely, minor β-thalassemic pregnant
 women treated for 30 days with ferrous sulfate (Arm B) showed
 a significant increase only for Hb (from 7.6 ± 1.6 to 10.2 ± 0.9
 g/dl) while RBCs, TSI, sFtn and IL-6 levels remained unchanged
 (Table 4). Regarding serum hepcidin concentration, it was not
 detectable either before or after both treatments. At delivery,
 in the bLf-treated minor β-thalassemic women, in addition to
 a significant decrease of IL-6 (from 25 ± 8 to 5 ± 4 pg/ml), a
 significant increase of Hb (from 7.8 ± 1.3 to 11.9 ± 0.7 g/dl)
 as well as a remarkable increase of both TSI (from 54 ±
 to 87 ± 16 µg/dl) and sFtn (from 23 ± 5 to 34 ± 6 ng/ml)
 were observed (Table 5). Conversely, in ferrous sulfate-treated
 minor β-thalassemic women, excepted for Hb concentration,
 no increase of other hematological parameters was detected
 (Table 5).
 
<section> As shown in 
<section> Table 6, HT pregnant women treated for 30 days
 with bLf (Arm C) showed a significant increase of RBCs (from
 
<section> 3,750 ± 127 × 3 to 4,354 ± 198 × 3 ), Hb (from 10.6 ± 0.4 to
 
<section> 12.2 ± 0.4 g/dl), TSI (from 36 ± 11 to 63 ± 9 µg/dl) and a slight
 increase of sFtn (from 11 ± 6 to 18 ± 2 ng/ml). These women
 presented high basal levels of IL-6 (89 ± 8 pg/ml) and hepcidin
 
<section> (115 ± 23 ng/ml) which were both significantly reduced (58 ±
 6 pg/ml and 65 ± 10 ng/ml, respectively) already after 30 days
 of bLf treatment. Conversely, HT pregnant women treated for
 days with ferrous sulfate (Arm D) showed a trend (p > 0.005), yet
 not significant, toward an increase of RBCs (from 3,650 ± 163 ×
 
<section> 3 to 3,960 ± 230 × 3 ) and Hb (from 10.8 ± 0.8 to 11.3 ±
 1.1 g/dl). Of note, both IL-6 and hepcidin levels do not show any
 change after the treatment.
 At delivery, the bLf-treated HT women showed significant
 increases in all hematological values, such as RBCs (from 3,750
 
<section> ± 127 × 3 to 4,482 ± 147 × 3 ), Hb (from 10.6 ± 0.4 to
 
<section> 12.7 ± 0.5 g/dl), TSI (from 36 ± 11 to 85 ± 10 µg/dl) and sFtn
 (from 11 ± 6 to 31 ± 3 ng/ml), as well as a significant decrease
 in both IL-6 and hepcidin levels (from 89 ± 8 to 50 ± 5 pg/ml
 and from 115 ± 23 to 65 ± 10 ng/ml, respectively). Conversely,
 HT women treated with ferrous sulfate management, showed no
 significant difference in any parameter evaluated compared to
 those obtained before the treatment (Table 7).
 
<section> Fetus and New-Born Outcomes
 The adverse effects of bLf and ferrous sulfate treatments on
 fetuses were monitored through ultrasonographic measurements
 of intrauterine growth and by the detection of amniotic fluid
 amount, expressed as AFI (39). No growth restriction was
 observed for any fetus. The AFI ranged from 13.4 ± 1.6 mean
 values at 34 weeks to 10.5 ± 2.3 mean values at 40 weeks. It is
 interesting to note that all the values were within 8 to 24 cm range,

<section> Efficacy of Bovine Lactoferrin Treatment in
 Pregnant Women Affected by Various
 
<section> Pathologies Against Anemia
 
<section> Table 8 presents 20 anemic pregnant women affected by different
 pathologies including also 3 HT twin pregnancies. The treatment
 based on bLf oral administration appeared reasonably efficient in
 treating anemia by increasing both Hb and TSI concentrations.
 Even if the other hematological parameters were not evaluated,
 bLf is efficient in increasing these two parameters related to
 anemia. Interestingly, 9 patients suffering from epilepsy showed
 an increase of about 2- or 3-fold of TSI concentration and
 more than 1 g/dl of Hb. In 3 pregnant women affected by
 insulin resistance diabetes type 2, bLf intervention showed an
 increase of both Hb and TSI similarly to that observed in
 pregnancies affected by Crohn’s disease. The efficacy of bLf
 oral administration has been also observed in 2 women with
 hypertension during the gestation. Of note, a great efficacy has
 been also observed in 3 HT twin pregnancies treated with 100 mg
 bLf three times a day before meals (instead of two times a day
 usually applied).

 serum IL-6 (from 24 ± 12 to 13 ± 8 pg/ml) concentration
 have been observed (Table 9). Conversely, no parameter was
 modified after ferrous sulfate treatment (Arm F). In addition,
 as observed in minor β-thalassemic pregnancies, hepcidin
 concentrations in minor β-thalassemic women of child-bearing
 age was not detectable (<1 ng/ml). Both bLf and ferrous sulfate
 interventions did not exert any effect on hepcidin synthesis
 (Table 9).
 
<section> Regarding HT women of child-bearing age, bLf treatment
 (Arm G) significantly increased the number of RBCs (from 3,664
 
<section> ± 205 × 3 to 4,280 ± 187 × 3 ) and the concentration of
 Hb (10.4 ± 0.8 to 12.5 ± 0.6 g/dl), TSI (from 36 ± 10 to 90 ±
 
<section> 12 µg/dl) and sFtn (from 9 ± 3 to 22 ± 6 ng/ml). Furthermore,
 this treatment also significantly decreased serum IL-6 and
 hepcidin synthesis (Table 10), similarly to that observed in HT
 pregnancies.
 Conversely, ferrous sulfate treatment in HT women of
 child-bearing age (Arm H) showed only a slight, yet not
 significant, increase for Hb and TSI. Of note, both IL-6 and
 hepcidin levels do not show any change after the treatment
 (Table 10).
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> Recently, Lf, a multifunctional glycoprotein, endowed with
 potent immune-modulatory properties, is emerging as an
 important component of iron and inflammatory homeostasis
 machinery (4, 23).
 In 2006, by designing our first clinical trial on the effect of
 30 days of bLf oral administration (100 mg two times a day
 before meals) compared with oral administration of ferrous
 sulfate (329.7 mg once a day during the meal) in anemic
 pregnant women, surprising results were obtained (36). Pregnant
 women receiving iron saturated bLf (20–30%) two times a day,
 absorbed 70–84 µg/day of elemental iron, respectively, through
 enterocytes. Although the concentration of iron supplemented
 by bLf is very far from that required daily (1–2 mg), a significant
 increase of the concentration of Hb and TSI was detected 30 days
 after treatment. Later on, in our subsequent clinical trials carried
 out on pregnant women suffering from anemia and AI, bLf
 treatment induced, in addition to Hb and TSI levels, a significant
 improvement of the number of RBCs and sFtn concentrations.
 Interestingly, a significant decrease of serum levels of IL-6,

 considered a key pro-inflammatory cytokine in iron homeostasis,
 was observed (4, 29, 37, 38). Differently from bLf, ferrous sulfate
 was ineffective in treating anemia and AI even if iron supply
 was a 1,000-fold higher than that furnished by bLf (about
 mg/day vs. about 80 µg/day). Moreover, ferrous sulfate does
 not decrease the levels of serum IL-6 (4, 29, 36–38). Therefore,
 even if the mechanism by which bLf exerts its anti-inflammatory
 activity is still under debate, there are strong evidences that bLf
 efficacy in treating anemia and AI is not linked to a direct iron
 supplementation, but to a more complex mechanism involving
 this protein in decreasing IL-6 and modulating hepcidin and Fpn,
 the most important iron homeostasis actors, both regulated by
 
<section> IL-6 (23, 44).
 In this respect, our group has recently demonstrated that
 bLf is able to revert the iron disorders in human inflamed-
 macrophages. In particular, bLf, by exerting its anti-inflammatory
 activity vs. IL-6 synthesis, determines the up-regulation of Fpn
 expression, thus leading to an efficient recovery of iron efflux
 from cells to blood (8, 9).
 The bLf anti-inflammatory activity has been explained by the
 discovery of its nuclear localization thus suggesting that this
 molecule may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of
 some genes of host inflammatory response (4, 45, 46). Lf is,
 therefore, a key element not only in the host defense system
 (47–49) but also a pivotal glycoprotein able to treat anemia
 through the inhibition of the inflammatory response, especially
 in pregnant women affected by HT (29).
 
<section> Here, we present novel and promising results on the efficacy
 and safety of bLf treatment in curing anemia and AI in minor
 β-thalassemic and HT pregnant and non-pregnant women,
 respectively, as well as anemia in pregnant women suffering from
 various pathologies.
 For the first time, the serum hepcidin has been detected in
 minor β-thalassemic and HT pregnant and non-pregnant women
 and correlated with all the other clinical parameters evaluated
 before and after bLf or ferrous sulfate management.
 Furthermore, we confirm the results obtained in our previous
 clinical trials on HT pregnancies (29) through the enrolment
 of additional 70 HT pregnant women and 79 HT women of
 child-bearing age.
 Overall, both HT pregnant and non-pregnant women, after
 30 days of bLf treatment, show a significant increase of RBCs,
 Hb, TSI and sFtn. Of note, bLf treatment also significantly
 reduces IL-6 and hepcidin levels compared to the high basal
 concentrations (Table 6 Arm C and 
<section> Table 10 Arm G). The effect
 of bLf treatment, leading to the down-regulation of hepcidin
 synthesis, should be considered as a signal of a regulatory
 mechanism exerted by bLf to avoid the pathological intracellular
 iron overload, thus restoring the physiological iron export to
 blood through Fpn up-regulation. In fact, the persistence of
 high levels of IL-6 and hepcidin would inhibit the iron export
 through the down-regulation and degradation of Fpn, causing
 an unsafe intracellular iron overload, specially in those cells
 involved in iron absorption and recycle, such as enterocytes

 and macrophages, respectively. As matter of fact, inflammation-
 mediated iron retention in macrophages determines the most
 pivotal cause of AI establishment and maintenance. Indeed,
 upon inflammatory stimulation, macrophages polarize in a sub-
 population, namely M1, characterized by production of pro-
 inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, the down-regulation of
 Fpn and up-regulation of cytosolic Ftn, leading to the block
 of iron recycling to blood from senescent erythrocytes, the
 major iron source for the body (50, 51). The current finding
 that bLf, through its anti-inflammatory activity, is able to
 revert this unsafe condition restoring the physiological iron
 export from macrophages to blood can be considered an
 actual molecular mechanism to explain the bLf efficacy, iron
 independent, in treating AI in HT pregnant and non-pregnant
 women.
 Conversely, ferrous sulfate treatment in HT pregnant and
 non-pregnant women shows a trend toward an increase in only
 RBCs and Hb. Moreover, this management fails in decreasing
 both IL-6 and hepcidin levels (Table 6 Arm D and 
<section> Table 10 Arm
 H). The failure of ferrous sulfate treatment could be explained by
 its inability to modulate hepcidin or Fpn expression in a direct
 way (never demonstrated) or indirectly through the inhibition of
 IL-6 synthesis (never demonstrated).
 The efficacy of bLf oral administration in treating anemia
 was also tested on pregnant women suffering from various
 pathologies. In these pregnant women bLf management appears
 effective (Table 8). Of note, regarding pregnant women affected
 by epilepsy, bLf treatment greatly increases TSI concentration
 (about 2- or 3-fold) and Hb (about 1 g/dl). The encouraging
 results were also obtained on HT twin pregnancies where the
 management has required an additional oral administration of
 bLf (100 mg three times a day).
 In this interventional study, the efficacy of bLf oral
 administration has been also demonstrated in anemic pregnant
 and non-pregnant women affected by minor β-thalassemia,
 an inherited autosomal recessive Hb disorder characterized by
 reduced synthesis of the β-chain of Hb (24).
 Even if the number of enrolled minor β-thalassemic women
 is low and does not allow to obtain conclusive and convincing
 results, bLf treatment demonstrates a simultaneous decrease
 in IL-6 and an increase in TSI both in pregnant and non-
 pregnant women even if at different extent (Table 4 Arm A
 and 
<section> Table 9 Arm E). Remarkably, in these subjects hepcidin
 is not detectable both before and after bLf management. This
 observation supports the hypothesis that bLf, independently
 from hepcidin but dependently from IL-6 down-regulation, may
 act as a positive regulator of Fpn, thus increasing iron efflux
 to blood. This potential mechanism is indeed supported by the
 increase of TSI values in all minor β-thalassemic women already
 after 30 days of bLf treatment (Table 4 Arm A and 
<section> Table 9 Arm
 E).
 Similar to bLf, ferrous sulfate treatment in minor β-
 thalassemic pregnant and non-pregnant women leads to an
 increase of Hb concentration while, conversely to bLf, it does
 not influence IL-6 synthesis (Table 4 Arm B and 
<section> Table 9 Arm F).
 Regarding serum hepcidin concentration, it was not detectable
 before and after ferrous sulfate intervention (Table 4 Arm B and
 
<section> Table 9 Arm F). Taken together all the results, alternatively to
 the hepcidin agonists or antagonists as therapeutic tools (20),
 bLf oral administration can be considered as a first promising
 compound in treating anemia through the decrease of both IL-6
 and hepcidin thus restoring Fpn-mediated iron export from cells
 to blood in an hepcidin dependent or independent way.
 Even if the number of patients is low and further investigations
 are required, these results highlight and support the importance
 of bLf oral administration in the treatment of the iron and
 inflammatory homeostasis disorders.
