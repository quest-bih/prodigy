<section> Impact statement
 
<section> In high-income settings, school-based universal mental health promotion programmes have been
 proven to be effective at improving adolescents’ mental health and well-being, including pre-
 venting and reducing the prevalence of depression in a large number of studies. Very few similar
 studies have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Among those, four studies
 found that school-based universal mental health promotion interventions had positive effects on
 students’ depression and anxiety. This universal school-based mental health programme can
 improve adolescents’ psychological well-being, coping self-efficacy and anger management, in
 addition to reducing depressive symptoms. The effects were observed not only immediately after
 the intervention, but some also at the 6 months follow-up. This programme, if integrated into the
 existing school curriculum in Vietnam and other low-and middle-income countries, might have
 potential long-term benefits for adolescents’ mental health and their physical health, academic
 performance and productivity in adulthood.

 health education approaches and do not require professionals (Regan et al., 2020). In high-income
 countries, several school-based universal mental health promotion programmes were found to be
 effective at improving adolescents’ mental health and well-being, including preventing and
 reducing the prevalence of depression (Arora et al., 2019; Feiss et al., 2019).
 As school enrolment rates among children and adolescents increase rapidly in low- and
 middle-income countries (LMIC) (UNESCO, 2015), there is increased recognition of the
 potential of universal school-based mental health programmes in preventing adolescent mental 
<section> health problems. In a recent systematic review (Caldwell et al.,
 2019) of school-based universal interventions targeting depression
 and anxiety, only five (Bonhauser et al., 2005; Gallegos, 2008; Rivet-
 Duval et al., 2011; Araya et al., 2013; Velásquez et al., 2015) of
 76 studies were conducted in LMIC. Four (Bonhauser et al., 2005;
 Gallegos, 2008; Rivet-Duval et al., 2011; Araya et al., 2013) of the
 five studies reported positive effects on students’ mental health
 outcomes. Another systematic review of universal school-based
 mental health programmes in LMIC found that nine of the
 12 included studies reported significant effects on depression
 and/or anxiety at post-evaluation (Bradshaw et al., 2021). A num-
 ber of recent school-based trials aimed to address adolescent mental
 health problems in LMIC (Michelson et al., 2020; Malik et al., 2021;
 Osborn et al., 2021). However, these studies all targeted adolescents
 with existing clinically significant symptoms of mental health
 problems; none investigated a universal intervention.
 Most universal mental health programmes, particularly school-
 based programmes, have been developed in high-income countries
 (Fazel et al., 2014a). Adaptation of evidence-based programmes
 developed in high-income countries for use in resource-constrained
 settings is a cost-effective and widely-used approach (Chowdhary
 et al., 2014). The evidence on the effectiveness of a number of adopted
 mental health interventions in new settings is positive (Benish et al.,
 2011; Chowdhary et al., 2014). However, some trials of programmes
 adopted and implemented in other countries had smaller effect sizes
 than those implemented within the country of development
 (Wigelsworth et al., 2016). The complexity of international transfer-
 ability of mental health programmes across countries and cultures is
 significant. A rigorous process from initial feasibility and acceptabil-
 ity assessment, cultural adaptation and testing of the adapted pro-
 gramme are crucial to ensure adequate effectiveness, as if
 implemented in the original setting (Bernal et al., 2009).
 The Resourceful Adolescent Program (RAP) (Shochet and Wurfl,
 2015), a universal school-based programme developed in Australia,
 aims to build psychological resilience and enhance the coping
 resources among adolescents to prevent depression and promote
 positive mental health. The RAP is a commercialised programme.
 The RAP is delivered in facilitated groups and comprises activities
 informed by cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) (Beck et al., 1979)
 and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) (Mufson et al., 1993).
 Aspects of CBT are incorporated into RAP to support adolescents
 to improve their ability to keep calm in stressful circumstances,
 engage in positive self-talk, and strengthen problem solving capacity,
 all to ultimately enhance self- and affect regulation. In addition, IPT
 is included to assist adolescents to build and maintain support
 networks, and to encourage the use of perspective and empathy to
 reduce interpersonal conflict.
 The effectiveness of RAP has been reported in three studies,
 particularly from English speaking, high-income countries.
 In Australia, one trial found that two intervention groups, RAP-A
 (RAP for adolescents) and RAP-F (RAP-A plus a programme for
 parents), had significantly larger decreases in depressive symptoms
 at post-intervention and 10-month follow-up, in comparison to the
 control group, who received the normal school curriculum (Shochet
 et al., 2001). Another trial compared RAP-Kiwi, the New Zealand
 version of RAP, to a placebo (art and craft activities without CBT)
 (Merry et al., 2004). To enhance the acceptability to New Zealand
 teenagers, the overall structure of the RAP was kept, but language,
 cartoons, and anecdotes were adapted in consultation with teen-
 agers, teachers and Asian and Pacific advisers. At post-intervention,
 the RAP-Kiwi group had significantly larger decreases in depression
 scores for both the Beck Depression Inventory II (Beck et al., 1996)
 and the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (Reynolds, 1986).
 Over the 18-month follow-up period, the Reynolds Adolescent
 Depression Scale scores remained significantly different between
 the intervention and placebo groups.
 The RAP has been used in 12 LMICs in the Pacific Islands, Asian,
 African and North American regions. However, Rivet-Duval et al.’s
 Mauritius-based study is the only one that has assessed the effect-
 iveness of the RAP among secondary school students (Rivet-Duval
 et al., 2011). In that study, the overall structure and content of the
 RAP was retained after consultation with teachers about cultural
 relevance. The programme was delivered by teachers in the English
 language. The intervention group had improved self-esteem and
 coping skills at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up in com-
 parison to the control group (normal curriculum only). The inter-
 vention had decreased symptoms of depression post-intervention,
 but not at 6-month follow-up. There is to date no study assessing the
 effectiveness of a translated version of RAP in an LMIC.
 The importance of adolescent mental health is increasingly
 being recognised in Vietnam as well as in other LMICs. A recent
 study in Vietnam reported that up to 23% of adolescents in schools
 were experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms (Thai
 et al., 2020). However, there are a lack of effective school-based
 mental health programmes that have high acceptability, feasibility
 and sustainability (Klasen and Crombag, 2013; Fazel et al., 2014b).
 As a universal strengths-based programme, RAP focuses on iden-
 tifying and developing strengths for every student, rather than only
 targeting students who are at high risk or who have pre-existing
 mental health problems. By including all students, RAP enhances
 acceptability and minimises stigma (Shochet et al., 2001). Our team
 has translated RAP and adapted it for use in upper secondary
 schools (years 10–12) in Vietnam to create the Vietnamese version,
 named ‘Happy House’. The aim of this study was to examine the
 effects of Happy House delivered in schools on the mental health of
 adolescents. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that the inter-
 vention could reduce adolescents’ depressive symptoms and
 improve their mental well-being, coping self-efficacy, and school
 connectedness 2 weeks after completion of the intervention and at
 the 6-month follow-up, when compared to adolescents receiving
 the regular school curriculum.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> This study was a school-based, two-arm, parallel, controlled trial
 conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam (Tran et al., 2020).
 
<section> Study settings
 
<section> Vietnam is located in south east Asia and is classified as a lower-
 middle income country, with a population of 98 million people.
 Hanoi is the capital city, one of the two largest cities in Vietnam.
 The population of eight million people in Hanoi is equally split
 between those living in urban and rural areas. In 2019, the school
 enrolment rate among school-aged children (6–18 years old) was
 91.7%, an increase from 79.1% in 1999 (GSO, 2019).
 
<section> Participant recruitment
 
<section> A multiple-stage method was used to select participants. First, we
 randomly selected two districts from a total of 12 urban districts
 and two from a total of 18 rural districts in Hanoi Province. Second, 
<section> two public high schools in each of the selected districts were
 randomly selected. In each of the selected schools, three to four
 grade 10 classes were randomly chosen and invited to participate in
 the study. Classes were only included if the school principal and
 class head teacher gave informed consent. In each district, we
 randomly assigned one school to the intervention and the other
 to the control arm. All participants in a single school received the
 same intervention. The sample selection process was performed by
 an independent statistician using Stata, Version 16 (StataCorp LP,
 College Station, Texas, USA) to create sequences of computer-
 generated random numbers.
 All students in the selected grade 10 classes (usually aged 15–
 16 years) were eligible. Students received an information package
 consisting of two explanatory statements (one for the student and
 the other for their parent/s or guardian/s) and a consent form from
 the research team a week prior to recruitment. If a parent/guardian
 and student agreed for the student to participate, the parent/guard-
 ian signed the written consent form, and the student returned the
 form to the research team on the day of baseline survey adminis-
 tration. Only students who agreed and who had a parent/guardian’s
 written consent to participate were recruited for this study.
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> Several major adaptations of RAP were made to create the Happy
 House programme, and these changes are described in detail else-
 where (La et al., 2022). First, Happy House was restructured from
 11 45-min sessions to six 90-min sessions over 6 weeks, without
 reducing the content (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Each Happy
 House session spans two consecutive school periods, each lasting
 45 min, with a 5-min break in between. These sessions replaced
 Civic Education and Ethics lessons. Second, the Vietnamese version
 was adapted so that it could be delivered in whole-class groups (40–
 45 students). The group sizes are larger than that of the original
 RAP (15 students). However, it is not feasible to deliver the Happy
 House programme in smaller groups because of constraints on
 facilities and human resources, and the school curriculum in Viet-
 nam. Finally, images and videos were adapted, redrawn and remade
 using Vietnamese characters. The relevance, comprehensibility and
 acceptability of Happy House were established through two pilot
 tests: a four-day facilitator training course including 12 volunteer
 teachers and 12 Vietnamese researchers, and a pilot test with
 43 participants recruited from a grade 10 class. In this study,
 teachers were included as facilitators, because integrating this pro-
 gramme into the existing school curriculum and being delivered by
 teachers will increase the sustainability in LMIC, where school
 counsellors are rarely available.
 The programme has a set of illustrated participant materials and
 short videos, and a facilitator’s manual with detailed guidelines to
 ensure fidelity. Fidelity was assessed using a checklist for facilitators
 to complete after each session, and a brief monitoring/supervision
 meeting between facilitators and the Vietnam Project Coordinator
 at the end of each intervention day. Issues that arose were discussed
 in these supervision meetings to reach a consensus solution. Par-
 ticipation rates for each session were closely monitored.
 In this trial, students in the intervention group received the
 Happy House programme in whole-class groups, in addition to
 their regular school curriculum. Each Happy House session was led
 by a main facilitator who was a school teacher. The facilitator was
 assisted by a member of the Vietnamese research team. The facili-
 tator was primarily responsible for delivering the session content,
 while the assistant assisted with material preparation and
 supported small group activities. Their roles were distinct and they
 were not rating students, so ’inter-rater reliability checks’
 between the facilitator and the assistant were neither indicated
 nor warranted.
 The control group received only the standard academic curricu-
 lum. In Vietnam, a standard academic curriculum for each grade in
 high school including subjects, contents and reference books is
 applied for every school. The subjects the Grade 10 students have
 are Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Technology, History, Geog-
 raphy, Literature, Civic Education, Secondary Language, Physical
 Education, and Computer Science. There are some contents related
 to health (in Physical Education and Biology) and interpersonal
 relationships (in Civic Education), but these do not include any
 mental health content or specific topics that presented in Happy
 House. The intervention group received the same standard aca-
 demic curriculum.
 
<section> Procedure
 
<section> The baseline survey was conducted 1 week after all participants
 were recruited. There were two follow-up assessments after the
 intervention. These were completed 2 weeks (hereafter called ‘post-
 intervention’) and 6 months post-intervention (hereafter called ‘6-
 month follow-up’). Baseline and follow-up assessments with the
 students were undertaken using self-completed questionnaires dur-
 ing a usual 45-min class session supervised by two trained data
 collectors from the Hanoi University of Public Health (HUPH).
 The instructions on how to complete the questionnaire were given
 orally at the beginning of the session. Students were asked to return
 the completed questionnaire sealed in an envelope which was
 provided. Data collectors were the only staff present. Students
 who did not want to participate and students whose parents did
 not grant consent for them to participate were invited to the school
 library to do their homework.
 Data collectors and data analysts were blinded to trial arms. A
 code number identifying the school, but not the trial arm, was
 assigned for each participant. Trial arms were un-blinded after
 the main analyses were conducted.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> Primary outcome
 Depressive symptoms were measured using the Centre for Epi-
 demiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (CESD-R) (Eaton
 et al., 2004), a 20-item scale that reflects the Diagnostic and Statis-
 tical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) defin-
 ition of Major Depressive Disorder (American Psychiatric
 Association, 2000). Responses to each of the items were given on
 a five-point Likert scale from 0 = ‘Not at all or less than 1 day in the
 past week’ to 4 = ‘Nearly every day for 2 weeks’. The total scale scores
 ranged from 0 to 80, with higher scores indicating more depressive
 symptoms. A total score < 16 was used as the cut-off for ‘no clinically
 significant depressive symptoms’, as this is the widely-used cut-off
 score (Radloff, 1977; Eaton et al., 2004). The CESD has been
 validated for use among adolescents in Vietnam (Nguyen et al.,
 2007), but the revised version has not yet been validated in this
 context. We examined the construct validity of the CESD-R using
 the baseline data of this study. Evidence of unidimensional meas-
 urement, excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha coeffi-
 cient = 0.92) and measurement invariance between males and
 females were established (Tran et al., 2022a). 
<section> Secondary outcomes
 Subjective mental well-being was assessed using the Mental Health
 Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF) (Keyes et al., 2008). MHC-SF
 consists of 14 items (feelings of well-being). Each item is scored
 from 0 = ‘Never’ to 5 = ‘Every day’. MHC-SF comprises three
 distinct subscale scores (dimensions): emotional well-being
 (3 items); social well-being (5 items); and psychological well-being
 (6 items). The emotional well-being subscale reflects positive emo-
 tional and life satisfaction. The social well-being subscale is meas-
 ures self-appraisal of their positive social functioning (social
 coherence, social acceptance, social actualisation, social contribu-
 tion, and social integration). The psychological well-being subscale
 reflects the extent to which an individual is realising their potential,
 including self-acceptance, personal growth, purpose in life, positive
 relations with others, autonomy, and environmental mastery.
 Higher dimension scores reflect better mental well-being. A valid-
 ation study confirmed the hypothesised factorial structure of the
 three subscales and a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach’s
 alpha coefficients of 0.81, 0.78 and 0.82 for emotional, social, and
 psychological well-being, respectively) among adolescents in Viet-
 nam (Ha, 2020).
 
<section> Specific self-efficacy for coping with stress was measured using the
 Coping Self-Efficacy Scale (CSES) (Chesney et al., 2006). The CSES
 assesses 26 behaviours that an individual might do when things
 aren’t going well or when they are having problems. The respond-
 ent rates on an 11-point scale (0 = ‘Cannot do at all’ to 10 = ‘Certain
 I can do’) the extent to which they believe they could perform each
 behaviour. The behaviours are grouped into three categories of
 coping strategies (sub-scales): problem-focused (concentrating on
 changing the stressor itself and its physical impact), emotion-
 focused (managing emotional responses to the event), and social
 support seeking. The CSES has not been locally validated. There-
 fore, we examined the structural aspect of the construct validity of
 the CSES using this study’s baseline data (Tran et al., 2022b). The
 original three sub-scale model was confirmed with some differ-
 ences. Two items (21 and 23) did not load into any of the sub-scales
 and were excluded, and item two (problem-focused) and item
 18 (social support) were moved to the emotion-focused subscale.
 In our validated version of the CSES, emotion-focused coping has
 nine items; problem-focused coping has the ten items; and social
 support coping has five items. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of the
 three sub-scales were at acceptable levels (emotion-focused: 0.91,
 problem-focused: 0.86, and social support: 0.75). Measurement
 invariance between males and females was supported. Sub-scale
 scores are the total scores of all items in each sub-scale. A higher
 sub-scale score indicates more self-efficacy for that coping strategy.
 
<section> School connectedness, the bond adolescents feel towards their
 school, was assessed using a scale developed by The National
 Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Sieving et al., 2001)
 which comprises five statements scoring from 0 = ‘strongly dis-
 agree’ to 4 = ‘strongly agree’. The total scale score ranges from 0 to
 20, where higher scores indicate higher levels of school connected-
 ness. This scale has been used in research on adolescent’s health in
 Vietnam (Pham, 2015).
 All of these outcomes were assessed at all three timepoints
 (baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up).
 
<section> Baseline characteristics
 
<section> We collected baseline characteristics of the participants including
 their age, sex (What is your sex? male or female), number of
 members in their household, parents’ education and occupation,
 and physical health (having a chronic condition such as asthma,
 heart disease, hepatitis, diabetes, allergies, or epilepsy or disability),
 using study-specific questions. The burden of academic activities
 was assessed using the Educational Stress Scale for Adolescents
 (Sun et al., 2011) which comprises 16 items about pressure from
 study, worry about grades, despondency, high self-expectation, and
 workload. Anger coping strategies were assessed using the Behav-
 ioural Anger Response Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents
 (BARQ-C) (Miers et al., 2007). Burden of academic activities
 (Pham, 2015) and anger coping strategies (Nguyen, 2010) are the
 major factors of depression and other mental health outcomes
 among student adolescents.
 
<section> Statistical analyses
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> The number of participants was calculated using the sampsi com-
 mand in Stata, Version 16 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas,
 USA). In each study arm, a minimum sample size of 502 adolescents
 was needed to detect a difference in the proportions of CESD-R
 score ≥ 16 of 41% (Nguyen et al., 2013) in the control arm and 31%
 in the Happy House intervention arm at 6-month follow-up (power
 of 90%, significance level of 0.05, and intra-cluster correlation of
 0.01).
 
<section> Statistical methods
 The primary outcome was included in both binary (clinically sig-
 nificant vs. no clinically significant depressive symptoms) and con-
 tinuous (CESD-R total score) formats. For each primary and
 secondary outcome, we performed two mixed models: Model 1 to
 estimate the difference in the outcome between the two arms at post-
 intervention and Model 2 to estimate the difference at 6-month
 follow-up. In these models, we controlled for all baseline character-
 istics presented in Table 1 (including the baseline values of the
 outcomes) and cluster-effects (district, school and class). The mixed-
 effect models incorporated random effects for district, school and
 class (specified as the data levels) and a fixed effect for trial arm
 (included in the models as an explanatory variable), which is the
 effect of the intervention on the outcome. Cohen’s d effect sizes were
 calculated for significant continuous outcomes (adjusted mean
 difference over the pooled standard deviation). Intraclass correl-
 ation coefficients (ICC) at the class level were calculated from those
 mixed models. The model assumptions including multicollinearity
 and normal distribution of standard errors were examined. The
 largest variance inflation factor (VIF), which measures the correl-
 ation and strength of correlation between the predictor variables in a
 regression model, is less than 10 indicating little or no multicolli-
 nearity. Graphical methods (Q-Q plot) were used to examine the
 normality assumption of the standard errors. All analyses followed
 intention-to-treat principles at the individual-level using Stata, Ver-
 
<section> sion
 As outlined in the protocol (Tran et al., 2020) we also planned to
 conduct ancillary analyses, including subgroup analyses by attend-
 ance (participated or did not participate) and a mediation analysis,
 testing the effects of the intervention on the primary outcome at
 6-month follow-up. In the mediation analysis, we intended to run
 multilevel structural equation models in MPlus Version 8 (Muthen
 and Muthen, 2017). The mediators that we planned to test were the
 secondary outcomes at 2 weeks post-intervention, as they were the
 intermediate outcomes that the intervention targeted to change.
 In the protocol, we planned to performed multi-imputation to
 treat missing data. However, conducting mixed effect model

 analysis under the multi-imputation led to many convergence
 problems. The proportions of missing data were relatively small
 and there was no evidence of data missing not at random. There-
 fore, missing data were treated in several steps. For each instru-
 ment, in cases where less than 20% of items were missing, missing
 data were imputed using the regression imputation method to
 predict the item’s missing value from other items of that instru-
 ment, other correlated instruments and socio-demographic char-
 acteristics. After the imputations, the remaining missing data were
 treated using pairwise deletion in the analyses.

<section> completed paper-based survey to an online survey (built in Qual-
 trics Insight Platform, Provo, UT) due to COVID-19 restrictions
 imposed on Hanoi during the period of data collection.
 A total of 1,084 from 1,128 eligible students (96.1%) were
 recruited and provided baseline data. The recruitment rate was
 slightly higher in the intervention than the control group (Figure 1).
 No school or teachers selected refused to participate in this study.
 One participant withdrew after the baseline survey and was not
 included in the analyses. The number of participants with any
 missing data at baseline was 29 (2.7%), at post-intervention was
 21 (1.9%) and at 6-month follow-up was 20 (1.9%). The missing
 proportions were similar in the two groups. The baseline charac-
 teristics of the groups with or without missing data of the primary
 outcome were not significantly different (Supplementary Table 3),
 suggesting that data were missing at complete random or missing at
 random.
 Overall, all students in the intervention group attended at least
 five in six Happy House sessions. The number of students missing
 one session was 27 (5.0%).
 
<section> Baseline data
 
<section> The socio-demographic characteristics of the two groups were
 slightly different (Table 1). In the control group, a greater propor-
 tion had parents with a higher level of education and working as
 government officers. The self-reported physical health and burden
 of academic activities were approximately similar between the two
 groups. There were some minimal differences in baseline data of the 
<insert> Figure 1. Trial profile. 
<iend>

 
<section> Estimation of intervention effects
 
<section> The fidelity checklists were completed by the facilitators after all
 sessions. These indicate that 100% of activities and content were
 delivered as planned.
 The odds of having the primary outcome (clinically significant
 depressive symptoms; CESD-R score ≥ 16) at post-intervention
 were statistically significantly lower in the intervention compared
 to the control group, when taking into account cluster effects and
 baseline data (Table 2). Similarly, the mean CESD-R score was
 statistically significantly lower in the intervention compared to the
 control group. Both of these differences became insignificant at
 6-month follow-up.
 There were some differences in the secondary outcomes
 between the two groups. The fully adjusted MHC-SF psychological
 well-being subscale mean differences between the intervention and
 control groups were significantly different at post-intervention, in
 favour of the intervention. All of the CSES subscale scores (with the
 exception of the emotion-focused subscale at 6-month follow-up)
 were significantly higher (more self-efficacy for coping with stress)
 in the intervention group at both time points. No effect of the
 intervention on the MHC-SF emotional and social-well-being or
 school connectedness was found.
 VIFs in all models in Table 2 were less than 10 indicating little or
 no multicollinearity. The residuals of all models were approxi-
 mately normally distributed.
 
<section> Ancillary analyses
 
<section> We did not conduct the ancillary analysis by attendance because
 almost all participants in the intervention group attended all ses-
 sions. We did not perform mediation analyses because the effect of
 the intervention on the primary outcome at 6-month follow-up was
 not significant.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> This school-based, two-arm, parallel, controlled trial addresses a
 major gap in evidence for the effectiveness of universal school-
 based mental health promotion programmes for adolescent in
 LMICs. Our main findings demonstrated that Happy House was
 effective in reducing depressive symptoms and promoting psycho-
 logical well-being at post-intervention among adolescents. This
 study included a large sample size which was drawn from both
 urban and rural areas. The refusal, attrition, and missing data rates
 were minimal.
 The prevalence of adolescents attending schools with clinically
 significant depressive symptoms at baseline was high but consistent
 with what found in previous studies in Vietnam (Thai et al., 2020).
 That prevalence is also similar to the results of a meta-analysis of
 43 studies from many countries, using General Health Question-
 naire, a common mental disorders symptom checklist (Silva et al.,
 2020). Symptom checklist instruments cannot provide diagnoses.
 However, clinically significant symptoms of mental health dis-
 orders are the target of prevention programmes. The large preva-
 lence found in this study suggests that universal prevention
 programmes for adolescent mental health are warranted and in
 urgent need.
 The proportions of students reporting clinically significant
 depressive symptoms increased from baseline to 2 weeks post-
 intervention (by 1.8%) and to 6 months follow-up (by 3.4%) in
 the control. It decreased from baseline to 2 weeks post-intervention
 (by 1.2%) and increased in 6 months follow-up (by 1.2%) in the
 intervention group. Concerns about potential iatrogenic harms
 (adverse effects) of universal school-based mental health pro-
 grammes (Hsu, 1996; Foulkes and Stringaris, 2023) arise due to
 the possibility that providing information and self-management
 strategies could raise awareness, but be insufficient to some sub-
 groups and not relevant to others. However, it’s important to note

 Calculated for significant continuous outcomes.
 that the increase in the proportion of clinically significant depres-
 sive symptoms in the intervention group from post-intervention to
 the 6-month follow-up might not necessarily indicate harm caused
 by the programme. Several factors support this interpretation.
 Firstly, a significant reduction in depressive symptoms was
 observed immediately post-intervention. Secondly, the increase in
 depressive symptoms was observed in both the intervention and
 control groups. Finally, and the most important, this study was
 implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the
 6 months follow-up period, strict restrictions were in place in Hanoi
 including stay-at-home lockdowns. There is evidence worldwide on
 the adverse impact of COVID-19 restrictions on adolescents’
 mental health (Panchal et al., 2023). The pattern of changes docu-
 mented in this study is likely to reflect the broader influence of the
 pandemic on adolescents’ mental health. It suggests that pro-
 grammes like this one that focus on building psychological know-
 ledge and skills are insufficient to modify the effects of lockdowns, a
 special situation, on adolescent mental health. Adolescent mental
 health related to the pandemic in this and other resource-
 constrained contexts warrants further research.
 The positive effect of the intervention on depressive symptoms
 found at 2 weeks post-intervention but not at 6-month follow-up is
 similar to the results of the RAP-A trial in other LMICs (Rivet-Duval
 et al., 2011). However, it is not consistent with the findings of two 
<section> trials of RAP-A in Australia and New Zealand, both high-income
 countries, which found that the effect remained 10–18 months after
 the intervention (Shochet et al., 2001; Merry et al., 2004). Two trials
 (Gallegos, 2008; Araya et al., 2013) of other school-based universal
 mental health interventions in LMICs followed up after a 6–
 12 months and assessed depressive symptoms. Both trials did not
 find a significant impact of the intervention on the outcome at the
 follow-up timepoints. There are too few studies to draw conclusions
 about the difference in effectiveness of interventions between high-
 income countries and LMICs. However, our findings and the pre-
 vious literature suggest that more efforts to sustain the beneficial
 effects of the interventions on depressive symptoms in LMIC are
 warranted. Integration of regular booster sessions may be useful to
 maintain the positive effects of the intervention.
 Compared to other analogous interventions, the magnitude of
 the effects of Happy House on depressive symptoms (Cohen’s d of
 0.11) has effect sizes smaller than some but higher than the others.
 In LMIC, Rivet-Duval et al. (2011) found a Cohen’s d effect size on
 post-intervention depressive symptoms of 0.32, Gallegos (2008)
 reported an effect size of 0.28 on post-intervention depressive
 symptoms and 0.10 at 6 month follow-up, and Fuspita et al. (2018)
 found an effect size of on post-intervention depressive symptoms
 of 1.57, but others did not find any significant effects (Conley
 et al., 2015; Velásquez et al., 2015; Bradshaw et al., 2021). Conley
 et al. (2015) conducted a meta-analysis of 103 universal mental
 health prevention programmes for higher education students and
 found a pooled effect size of 0.2 for depressive symptoms and the
 effect size of our study is higher than 29 programmes (28%). Dray
 et al. (2017) found a pooled effect size of 0.08 of 49 universal
 school-based resilience-focused interventions for children and
 adolescents’ depressive symptoms. Tanner-Smith et al.’s review
 of 74 meta-analyses to assess the effects of universal mental health
 promotion and prevention programmes for school-age youth
 provides the mean effect size distributions which are the appro-
 priate evidence-based standards for judging the relative effects of
 universal prevention programmes for adolescents (Tanner-Smith
 et al., 2018). For the interventions targeting internalising prob-
 lems (anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions), the
 th , th , and 75th percentile effect sizes are 0.10, 0.18 and 0.27,
 respectively. Therefore, the effect size of our intervention is larger
 than 25% of other universal prevention programmes. Overall,
 universal school-based interventions targeting adolescents’ men-
 tal health have relatively small effect sizes per participant. How-
 ever, universal interventions like Happy House can reach a large
 number of people. Therefore, even with a small change for an
 individual, universal interventions can have large potential for
 populations.
 Our study is the first to date in an LMIC to assess the impact of a
 universal school-based mental health programme on subjective
 mental well-being. Mental well-being is related to, but different
 from, mental illness, such as depression (Keyes, 2005). Among the
 three dimensions of mental well-being, we found that Happy House
 improves psychological well-being, but not emotional or social
 well-being. The higher psychological well-being people have, the
 more they like most parts of themselves (self-acceptance), have
 warm and trusting relationships (positive relations with others), see
 themselves developing into better people (personal growth), have a
 direction in life (purpose in life), are able to shape their environ-
 ment to satisfy their needs (environmental mastery), and have a
 degree of self-determination (autonomy). Through the RAP prin-
 ciples of building adolescents’ resilience and focusing on their
 strengths, Happy House appears to impact psychological well-
 being directly. Emotional well-being is the individual’s satisfaction
 with life overall, and social well-being consists of social coherence,
 social acceptance, social actualisation, social contribution, and
 social integration. The intervention primarily focuses on improving
 relationships and reducing conflict; a much narrower focus than
 what emotional and social well-being covers. In this study, all three
 dimensions of mental well-being were measured as part of the well-
 being assessment. If emotional and social well-being were
 improved, it may have been interesting to observe that Happy
 House could have impacts outside the aim. However, it is not
 surprising that we found that Happy House improves only psycho-
 logical well-being but not the other two positive mental health
 domains significantly.
 In the CBT components of Happy House, adolescents are
 encouraged to develop a variety of skills to manage stressful and
 difficult circumstances, including maintaining positive self-talk,
 keeping calm (self-regulation and self-relaxation), problem-solving
 (defining problems, considering solutions, using a step-by-step
 approach for carrying out and evaluating the solution), and support
 networks (encouraging seeking help when necessary to maintain
 their emotional well-being). In this study, the positive effects of
 Happy House on all three coping strategies (problem-focused,
 emotion-focused, and social support seeking) were demonstrated.
 These findings are consistent with the RAP trial in Mauritius in
 which the intervention improved coping skills at postintervention
 and 6-month follow-up (Rivet-Duval et al., 2011). The improve-
 ments in adequate coping skills were reported in some other
 universal school-based programmes in lower-middle-income
 countries (Barry et al., 2013). The evidence, all together, strongly
 support that adolescents’ coping skills can be improved through
 school-based universal programmes.
 The matter of employing p-value adjustments in trials involving
 multiple outcome measures is a subject of ongoing debate. On one
 hand, there are recommendations advocating for p-value adjust-
 ments due to the increased risk of encountering at least one stat-
 istically significant test result by chance alone, leading to potential
 misidentification of differences (Bland and Altman, 1995). Con-
 versely, adjustments can diminish the likelihood of committing
 type I errors (i.e., introducing ineffective treatments) but can
 thereby elevate the possibility of type II errors (i.e., overlooking
 effective treatments), an outcome equally significant to type I errors
 (Rothman, 1990; Feise, 2002). In the context of this study, p-value
 adjustments were not taken into consideration prior to the analyses
 (as outlined in the protocol). However, upon applying p-value
 adjustments to the secondary outcomes via the Bonferroni correc-
 tion formula (Hsu, 1996), the strictest method, it becomes evident
 that the three Coping Self-Efficacy Scale subscales exhibited sig-
 nificant improvement post-intervention and at the 6-month
 follow-up, except for the Emotion-focused and Problem-focused
 sub-scale scores at the 6-month follow-up.
 One of the adaptations of the RAP in Vietnam is increasing the
 group size from up to 16 adolescents in the original version to
 encompass the entire class (approximately 40 to 45 students), The
 adaption aims to enhance acceptability and feasibility when scaling
 up. During the pilot, we encountered several challenges related to
 the larger group sizes. Firstly, ensuring that the majority of students
 grasp the session’s content adequately poses a difficulty for the
 facilitator. Secondly, engaging all students in discussions becomes
 more complex. Finally, many activities are more difficult to execute
 and manage within a larger group, sometimes leading to disorder
 and disruptions to nearby classes. To address these challenges, we
 formulated strategies including adding an assistant to support the 
<section> facilitator in each session and occasionally dividing the class into
 smaller groups for discussions and activities when necessary.
 We acknowledge some limitations of this study. First, we could
 not randomise the classes because multiple classes per school were
 involved in this study. If students in the same school (but different
 classes) received different types of intervention, it would have
 increased the risk of contamination significantly. We acknowledge
 that the school characteristics (including teachers and students
 within the school) could be confounding factors that led to biases
 in this study. Second, we did not pair schools between intervention
 and control groups due to the lack of necessary data that could help
 balance the baseline characteristics between the two study arms.
 Third, the main outcome measure is not a diagnostic instrument.
 However, the CESD-R is the one of the most widely accepted
 depressive symptom checklists in research and clinical practice.
 This scale covers all symptoms in the DSM-IV’s diagnostic criteria
 for Major Depressive Disorder. Fourth, all our data were self-
 reported, which may have introduced response biases. Fifth, fidelity
 in this study was self-assessed by the facilitators. There was no
 assessment on the delivery quality and engagement conducted. We
 planned for this assessment to be conducted by research team
 members from Australia. However, COVID-19 restrictions during
 the course of intervention prevented team members travelling
 internationally. Sixth, this study was implemented during the
 COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, we are confident that
 COVID-19 pandemic did not cause any significant bias in this
 study because both study arms experienced the same COVID-19
 restrictions during the study period. Finally, we had hoped that our
 study would provide information about the mechanisms of the
 effect of the intervention on the main outcome. However, the
 intervention only had an effect on the main outcome at post-
 intervention, the same timepoint the potential mediators were
 measured. Therefore, as the criterion of time order was not met,
 we were prevented from conducting these ancillary analyses.
 
<section> Implications and conclusions
 
<section> This study demonstrates the positive impact of Happy House on
 adolescents’ depressive symptoms, psychological well-being, and
 stress coping strategies. This trial had high recruitment and par-
 ticipation rates and no adverse effects were found. The findings of
 this study can be generalised to other areas in Vietnam and other
 countries with similar social, economic and cultural environments.
 We suggest that further adaptation of this programme to
 improve long-term effects is warranted. This programme, if inte-
 grated into the existing school curriculum with regular booster
 sessions, might have potential wider long-term benefits. Effective
 problem solving and emotion regulation strategies for adolescents
 are all potentially beneficial to not only their mental health but also
 their physical health, academic performance and productivity in
 adulthood. A retest of the adapted version is also necessary to
 confirm the long-term effects before scaling up can be considered.
 In addition, a barrier for the scale up of RAP in Vietnam and other
 LMICs is that RAP is commercialised. It is free for research but has
 a charge if it is being implemented. We are conducting an economic
 analysis alongside this trial and the results will be published in a
 separate paper. That economic analysis will provide necessary
 information for policy makers and programmers to make decisions
 on taking this programme to scale.
 In conclusion, this study strongly supports that Happy House
 has great potential to be integrated into the existing school
 curriculum to reduce the prevalence of adolescent mental health
 problems, and to promote positive mental health in Vietnam.
