<section> Abstract
 
<section> Community HIV strategies are important for early diagnosis and treatment, with new self-
 care technologies expanding the types of services that can be led by communities. We eval-
 uated mechanisms underlying the impact of community-led delivery of HIV self-testing
 (HIVST) using mediation analysis. We conducted a cluster-randomised trial allocating
 group village heads and their catchment areas to the community-led HIVST intervention in
 addition to the standard of care (SOC) or the SOC alone. The intervention used participatory
 approaches to engage established community health groups to lead the design and imple-
 mentation of HIVST campaigns. Potential mediators (individual perceptions of social cohe-
 sion, shared HIV concern, critical consciousness, community HIV stigma) and the outcome
 (HIV testing in the last 3 months) were measured through a post-intervention survey. Analy-
 sis used regression-based models to test (i) intervention-mediator effects, (ii) mediator-out-
 come effects, and (iii) direct and indirect effects. The survey included 972 and 924
 participants in the community-led HIVST and SOC clusters, respectively. The community-
 led HIVST intervention increased uptake of recent HIV testing, with no evidence of indirect
 effects from changes in hypothesised mediators. However, standardised scores for commu-
 nity cohesion (adjusted mean difference [MD] 0.15, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.32, p = 0.10) and
 shared concern for HIV (adjusted MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.29, p = 0.09) were slightly
 higher in the community-led HIVST arm than the SOC arm. Social cohesion, community
 concern, and critical consciousness also apparently had a quadratic association with recent
 testing in the community-led HIVST arm, with a positive relationship indicated at lower
 ranges of each score. We found no evidence of intervention effects on community HIV 
<section> stigma and its association with recent testing. We conclude that the intervention effect
 mostly operated directly through community-driven service delivery of a novel HIV technol-
 ogy rather than through intermediate effects on perceived community mobilisation and HIV
 stigma.
 
<section> Introduction
 
<section> Knowledge of HIV status is critical for controlling HIV transmission, with 1.7 million people
 newly infected with HIV in 2018 [1]. Effective HIV testing services (HTS) can enable early
 diagnosis and linkage to treatment among HIV-positive individuals and linkage to prevention
 among individuals at risk for HIV. Expanded HTS provision through health facilities has
 improved awareness of HIV status in sub-Saharan Africa, which contributes the majority of
 new HIV cases [1]. Community HIV strategies can facilitate early diagnosis and treatment [2,
 3] to reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality and limit HIV transmission through treat-
 ment and prevention [4]. Self-care products, including HIV self-testing (HIVST), are also gen-
 erating opportunities beyond health facilities to reach underserved population sub-groups
 
<section> [5, 6].
 Community-led strategies for HIV prevention and management involve community
 groups or organisations leading the design and implementation of HIV programmes [7],
 with new self-care technologies expanding the types of interventions that can be led by com-
 munities. Previous studies have reported improved identification of HIV-positive cases and
 reduced HIV incidence when communities were involved in the provision of mobile HTS
 [8, 9]. Community mobilisation approaches that address social and structural drivers of
 HIV can also impact protective HIV behaviours, including improved condom use and
 reduced concurrency of sexual partners [10]. Across disease areas, studies have demon-
 strated the health impact of interventions involving community participation [11–13].
 Understanding how community-led interventions affect outcomes is important for maxi-
 mising the effect and cost-efficiency of community health programmes, though evidence
 their pathways to impact is limited [7].
 Mediation analysis involves evaluating how an intervention changes an outcome by testing
 hypotheses about the potential causal mechanisms [14]. A mediator is an intermediate variable
 that is affected by an exposure and subsequently affects an outcome, with statistical techniques
 used to quantify the mediation effect [15]. Mediation analysis has been applied within rando-
 mised trials to test hypothesised pathways underlying the intervention effect on an outcome
 [14]. Findings from mediation analysis can therefore support explanation of cause-effect rela-
 tionships and inform optimisation of interventions to influence key mechanisms.
 In the current study, we assessed mediation within a cluster-randomised trial of commu-
 nity-led delivery of HIVST in Malawi. Primary analysis from the trial previously reported an
 increase in the proportion of the population who tested for HIV, including adolescents 15–19
 years, older adults 40 years and above, and men [16]. We examined whether changes in the
 hypothesised mediators, community mobilisation domains and community HIV stigma,
 mediated the impact of the intervention on HIV testing, aiming to consider broader lessons
 for community-led programmes. Specifically, we tested (i) the effect of the intervention on the
 potential mediators, (ii) the effect of the potential mediators on recent HIV testing, and (iii)
 the direct intervention effect on recent testing and the indirect effect from changing the poten-
 tial mediators. 
<section> Materials and methods
 
<section> Ethics statement
 
<section> The trial, which is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03541382), was conducted as part
 the Unitaid/PSI HIV Self-Testing Africa Initiative (STAR) [http://hivstar.lshtm.ac.uk/]. Ethical
 approvals were received from the University of Malawi College of Medicine (P.01/18/2332),
 London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (14761), and WHO (STAR-comm led
 CRT-Malawi).
 
<section> Trial design, procedures, and data collection
 
<section> We evaluated the role of community mobilisation domains and community HIV stigma as
 mediators between community-led delivery of HIVST and recent HIV testing within a cluster-
 randomised trial [17]. The trial was conducted in Mangochi district and randomised 30 group
 village heads and their catchment areas 1:1 to the community-led HIVST intervention in addi-
 tion to the standard of care (SOC) or the SOC alone. The community-led HIVST intervention
 used participatory approaches to engage established community health groups to lead the
 design and implementation of HIVST campaigns [18]. Community actors included commu-
 nity health action groups and community volunteers, who respectively provide community
 health services at group village head and village-level, and government community health
 workers (CHW). The SOC included HIV testing by lay counsellors through government
 health facilities and periodic community-based outreach. The study team included Population
 Services International (PSI) Malawi, the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research
 Programme, and the Ministry of Health.
 The intervention adapted participatory learning and action methods, with each cluster devel-
 oping HIVST campaign strategies unique to their respective areas. Implementation was stag-
 gered in groups of two-to-three clusters. The study team held two-day participatory workshops
 attended by community health action groups and CHWs. In their respective clusters, partici-
 pants defined determinants of HIV infection, mapped HIV services and barriers to access, and
 identified priority sub-groups with low uptake of HIV services. Participants designed cluster-
 specific HIVST campaigns and decided on how to distribute HIVST kits, provide support for
 linkage to routine HIV care, and generate demand for HIVST. The study team then conducted
 two-day trainings with community volunteers on supporting use and interpretation of HIVST
 kits and linkage to HIV prevention and treatment, communicating HIV prevention messages,
 managing social harms, handling and storing kits, and collecting data. Afterwards, community
 health actions groups, community volunteers, and CHWs led a fixed seven-day campaign based
 on strategies developed for each cluster. Cluster residents aged 15 years and older were eligible
 to take an HIVST kit for themselves and for secondary distribution. The study team provided
 the OraQuick HIV Self-Test (Orasure Technologies, Thailand), instructional materials, data
 collection tools, and nationally standardised gratuity of MWK 7,000 (US$10) per volunteer.
 Outcomes were measured through a post-intervention survey administered eight-to-12
 weeks after the start of the intervention in community-led HIVST clusters or matched dates
 SOC clusters. In each cluster, villages with at least 500 residents and located near the group
 head village were randomly selected, with households recruited using a clockwise spiral from
 defined location. The survey aimed to recruit at least 250 participants based on sample size cal-
 culations for the trial, with cluster residents aged 15 years and older eligible. Cluster residents
 provided written informed consent or assent with parent or guardian consent for adolescents
 15–17 years. Participants were interviewed on their sociodemographic background and prior
 HIV-related experience. Process data were collected through the survey and HIVST registers.

<section> Mediation framework
 
<section> The causal directed acyclic graph illustrating the mediation framework for the current study
 presented in Fig 1. Potential mediators were identified based on a conceptual framework
 drawn from the literature on community participation in health interventions. Community
 participation can be conceptualised along a continuum of increasing empowerment [18],
 defined as “a social action process by which individuals, communities, and organisations gain
 mastery over their lives in the context of changing their social and political environment to
 improve equity and quality of life” [19]. Most practice of community empowerment for health
 is operationalised through participatory learning and action methods that engage community
 groups and organisations in the design, implementation, and evaluation of health interven-
 tions [18]. Localising decision-making and resource allocation is posited to enhance the cover-
 age and efficiency of health interventions, while devolvement of power and control to
 marginalised populations is proposed to enable more equitable healthcare distribution [20].
 In the context of HIV prevention, Lippman (2013) proposed multiple domains of commu-
 nity mobilisation that would need to be affected to improve HIV-related behaviours and out-
 comes [21]. Building social cohesion, specifically through shared trust or a common sense of
 identity, was regarded as a necessary antecedent for successful social mobilisation [21, 22].
 Raising critical consciousness through collective dialogue and action was also considered an
 important component of community mobilisation [21–23]. Additional domains included
 shared concern for HIV as a priority health issue, participation in collective action, organisa-
 tional structures and networks facilitating collective action, and leadership [21, 23].
 Another hypothesised mechanism of action is by influencing HIV stigma, which has been
 consistently noted as a barrier to engagement with HIV services [24, 25]. HIV stigma stems
 from drivers such as fear of HIV infection and social judgement and can subsequently impede
 access and utilisation of HIV services [26]. Community-led strategies could change norms
 around care-seeking by activating community support for HIV prevention and treatment. A
 separate hypothesis suggests the role of HIVST in reducing HIV stigma by empowering indi-
 viduals and normalising HIV testing [27].
 
<section> HIVST, HIV self-testing. Causal directed acrylic graph of the mediation framework. � Measured at the individual 
<section> For the current study, we hypothesised that individual-level community mobilisation domains
 and community HIV stigma acted as mediators between the community-led HIVST intervention
 and the outcome of tested for HIV in the last 3 months. We collected data on hypothesised media-
 tors in the post-intervention survey among a random sample (approximately 20%) of participants
 receiving an extended questionnaire. Community constructs are commonly captured at the indi-
 vidual level to represent individual perceptions within the community or aggregated at the com-
 munity level to denote shared perceptions [28]. Given the brief implementation period, we
 hypothesised that the intervention would likely impact individual perceptions of community mea-
 sures rather than broader norms. To measure dimensions of community mobilisation, we used
 subset of domains from previously validated scores [28]. Data were captured on perceived social
 cohesion, a six-item scale for sense of community; perceived shared HIV concern, a 10-item scale
 for concern related to HIV prevention; and perceived critical consciousness, an 11-item scale for
 collective problem assessment and resolution (Table A in S1 Text) [28]. Community HIV stigma
 included five items measuring perceptions of HIV stigma within the community, with responses
 based on a three-point Likert scale (Table A in S1 Text) [29].
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> Analysis was restricted to participants providing complete data for the outcome and potential
 mediators. We assessed implementation outcomes, including awareness and uptake of HIV
 self-testing, and evaluated intervention and mediation effects. Our mediation model estimated
 the effect of the cluster-level intervention (community-led HIVST) on the individual-level
 mediators (social cohesion, shared HIV concern, critical consciousness, community HIV
 stigma) and outcome (tested for HIV in the last 3 months). Individual-level scores for each
 potential mediator were generated by summing the question items and standardising the raw
 scores, with higher scores representing higher levels of each domain. To assess scale reliability,
 we calculated Raykov’s rho from confirmatory factor analysis using a weighted least squares
 approach [30]. Coefficients for social cohesion (0.86), shared concern (0.95), critical con-
 sciousness (0.96), and community HIV stigma (0.77) showed acceptable reliability.
 Mediation analysis was based on a counterfactual framework that extends the product-of-
 coefficients approach to accommodate a common binary outcome and interaction between
 the intervention and mediator [15, 31–33]. Effect estimates include natural direct and indirect
 effects. The direct effect is the intervention effect on the outcome if the mediator was fixed at
 the level it would have taken in the absence of the intervention. The indirect effect measures
 the mediation effect; that is, the effect on the outcome caused by the intervention effect on the
 mediator and the subsequent effect of the mediator on the outcome. Effects can be causally
 interpreted assuming control is made for intervention-mediator, intervention-outcome, and
 mediator-outcome confounding and mediator-outcome confounders are not affected by the
 intervention [15]. Randomisation of the intervention can minimise confounding bias, though
 further control may be needed to account for cluster randomisation [34]. Adjustment for
 mediator-outcome confounding is also important given the strong assumptions required for
 causal interpretation of direct and indirect effects.
 We fitted a set of regression models for each potential mediator. To estimate intervention-
 mediator effects, model 1 included linear regression of the potential mediator on the study
 arm. The model also included a set of covariates that showed imbalance between study arms
 (sex, age group, literacy, religion, ethnicity, health status), or was a potential mediator-out-
 come confounder (social capital) as identified through Fig 1. Social capital, defined as mem-
 bership in community groups, was selected since the measure represented a time-invariant
 measure of social relationships and networks (Table A in S1 Text). A random effect for the 
<section> cluster was used to account for the cluster-randomised design [34, 35]. To estimate mediator-
 outcome effects, we used a Poisson model with robust standard errors to approximate risk
 ratios, since the outcome was common [36]. Model 2, which was stratified by arm, used Pois-
 son regression and included the outcome on the mediator, covariates, and the mediator-out-
 come confounder. We investigated the relationship between the standardised score of the
 mediator and the outcome by including linear and quadratic terms of the mediator. The
 model also adjusted for clustering with a random effect.
 To calculate direct and indirect effects, we used estimates from Model 1 and a third model
 [15]. Model 3 included Poisson regression of the outcome on the study arm, the potential
 mediator, an intervention-mediator interaction term, covariates, and the mediator-outcome
 confounder, with a robust standard error and random effect for cluster. Mediators showing
 non-linear relationship with the outcome were log-transformed in both models. To calculate
 confidence intervals for direct and indirect effects, we used a bias-corrected bootstrap
 approach with 1,000 replicates [37]. To explore heterogeneity in intervention and mediation
 effects, we additionally stratified our analysis by sex and age group, with a focus on adolescents
 15–19 years and older adults 40 years and above due to more substantial gaps in undiagnosed
 HIV. Stata version 14.0 was used for statistical analysis.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Response rates for the post-intervention survey were 90.2% (3960/4388) and 89.2% (3920/
 4394) in the community-led HIVST and SOC arms, respectively (Fig A in S1 Text). Of eligible
 participants, 24.8% (1955/7880) were selected for the extended module. Most participants
 were included in the primary analysis, with 97.0% (970/1000) in the community-led HIVST
 arm and 96.6% (923/955) in the SOC arm providing complete data. The majority of partici-
 pants obtained primary-level education or below and were married (Table 1). Individual char-
 acteristics were mainly balanced between arms.
 
<section> Implementation
 
<section> The community-led HIVST intervention was delivered in 15 eligible clusters from 5th Octo-
 ber, 2018 to 17th January, 2019. HIVST campaigns were implemented by 157 community
 health action group members (cluster mean 10.5) and 190 community volunteers (cluster
 mean 12.7; Table B in S1 Text). Implementation strategies involved sensitisation and distribu-
 tion of HIVST kits at village head-led community meetings, homes, and fixed locations and
 social hotspots, including schools, churches and mosques, boreholes, fishing docks, sports
 fields, and video shows. Strategies to support linkage to routine HIV services included active
 post-test follow-up, phone referrals to health facilities, and material assistance such as trans-
 portation funds. Overall, 24,316 HIVST kits (cluster mean 1621) were distributed.
 Self-testing for HIV in the last 3 months was 72.6% (704/970) in the community-led HIVST
 arm, ranging by cluster from 40.3% to 92.7%, and 5.4% (50/923) in the SOC arm (Table B in
 S1 Text). In the community-led HIVST arm, HIVST uptake was lowest among women aged
 40 years and above (65.2%, 101/155) and highest among women aged 20 to 39 years (82.5%,
 241/292; Fig B in S1 Text). The proportion of participants who had heard of HIVST was 96.1%
 (932/970) in the community-led HIVST arm, varying by cluster from 83.5% to 100.0%, and
 36.5% (337/923) in the SOC arm.

 and the outcome by study arm are presented in Table 2, with the risk ratio [RR] denoting the
 change in recent HIV testing (in the last 3 months) associated with a standard deviation
 increase in the score for the potential mediator. As illustrated in Fig 2, social cohesion and
 shared concern for HIV demonstrated a strong quadratic association with recent testing in the
 community-led HIVST arm, with a positive relationship measured at lower levels of scores fol-
 lowed by a waning effect at higher levels. Similarly, critical consciousness showed a positive

 testing. In the SOC arm, there was no evidence for a strong association between each potential

 In sub-group analysis, community HIV stigma was strongly associated with recent HIV
 testing among women in the community-led HIVST arm (adjusted RR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to
 1.00, p = 0.05). Social cohesion also showed a strong quadratic relationship with recent testing
 (Fig C1 in S1 Text). Among men, shared HIV concern and critical consciousness were found
 to have a strong quadratic association with recent testing in the community-led HIVST arm
 (Fig C2 in S1 Text). There was also evidence of a quadratic relationship between shared HIV
 concern and recent testing among older adults in the community-led HIVST arm. No evi-
 dence of an association was observed between potential mediators and recent testing in adoles-
 cent counterparts (Fig D1 and D2 in S1 Text). Further, sub-group analysis did not detect a
 strong association between nearly all potential mediators and recent testing in the SOC arm
 well as an interaction effect by study arm (Tables C and E in S1 Text).
 
<section> Direct and indirect effects of intervention on outcome

<section> Discussion
 
<section> This study used causal mediation approaches to assess whether measures of community mobi-
 lisation and community HIV stigma mediated the effect of community-led delivery of HIVST
 on recent HIV testing. We found that the community-led HIVST intervention increased
 uptake of recent testing, with the effect appearing to be almost entirely direct. There was no
 evidence of indirect effects from changes in perceived social cohesion, shared HIV concern,
 critical consciousness, and community HIV stigma at the individual level. However, the

<section> intervention did slightly increase levels of perceived social cohesion and shared concern for
 HIV. Higher perceived social cohesion, community concern for HIV, and critical conscious-
 ness also apparently had a positive relationship with recent testing at lower levels of scores fol-
 lowed by a diminishing effect in the community-led HIVST arm. We found no evidence of
 intervention effects on perceptions of critical consciousness and community HIV stigma as
 well as an association between community stigma and recent testing. Few studies have quanti-
 tatively assessed mechanisms underlying the effect of community participation in health inter-
 ventions. We conclude that the intervention effect mostly operated directly through
 community-driven service delivery of a novel HIV technology rather than through intermedi-
 ate effects on individual perceptions of community mobilisation and HIV stigma.
 We reported that the effect of the community-led HIVST intervention on recent HIV test-
 ing mostly occurred through direct pathways. Therefore, we mainly attribute the impact of the
 intervention to community ownership in the design and implementation of the HIVST cam-
 paign, which showed good coverage, rather than to changes in individual perceptions of social
 cohesion, shared HIV concern, and critical consciousness [20, 38]. The absence of indirect
 effects potentially stems from the intervention design. The intervention was developed for
 communities to periodically lead provision of HIV programmes, with frequency dependent
 contextual factors including prevalence of undiagnosed HIV. The short implementation
 period had certain advantages, with the intervention yielding low unit costs for a community
 HIV testing programme [39]. However, such a strategy is perhaps more conducive to commu-
 nity participation in biomedical interventions in contrast with interventions aimed at impact-
 ing social and structural determinants of HIV. Previous studies of community participation
 HIV programmes involved multi-year implementation to build community empowerment [9,
 40, 41]. Longer implementation periods and more explicit intervention on dimensions of com-
 munity empowerment may therefore be needed in order to influence downstream determi-
 nants of HIV but would likely require additional economic investment.
 Despite the lack of evidence for indirect effects, we found that the community-led HIVST
 intervention may have led to changes in individual perceptions of shared HIV concern and
 social cohesion, overall and among sub-groups including women. Of the potential mediators,
 we posited that the intervention would most likely impact community HIV concern, which
 captures the importance of HIV as a collective priority, since the measure was specific to HIV.
 More generic scores included social cohesion, which captured community connectedness, and
 critical consciousness, which measured collective problem resolution. In the community-led 
<section> HIVST arm, individual perceptions of social cohesion, community concern for HIV, and criti-
 cal consciousness demonstrated a positive association with recent HIV testing at lower ranges
 of each score followed by a negative association at higher levels. The quadratic relationship
 may indicate the limited effect of community mobilisation domains on the outcome, which
 reaches a maximum point at low scores. A limited number of studies have quantitatively evalu-
 ated the contribution of community participation towards improving HIV-related outcomes.
 A multi-country study in southern Africa and Thailand reported that community mobilisation
 delivered with mobile HTS increased positive social norms for HIV testing [9]. Success was
 attributed to community engagement and relationship-building and context-specific, iterative
 implementation [42]. In South Africa, community mobilisation domains were associated with
 HIV testing following the implementation of a community mobilisation intervention [41],
 with interpersonal and community-level respect, communication, and empathy concluded to
 be integral components of change [43]. Our study adds to the literature by evaluating the role
 of community participation and continues to highlight the potential of investing in commu-
 nity health systems as a strategy for HIV prevention.
 We hypothesised that the community-led HIVST intervention could reduce perceived
 community HIV stigma at the individual level by mobilising community support for HIV pre-
 vention or normalising HIV testing through HIVST. This study did not find strong evidence
 for an intervention effect on community HIV stigma nor an effect of community stigma levels
 on recent HIV testing. To reduce community HIV stigma, interventions would also likely
 require a longer period of implementation that specifically targeted drivers of stigma [44]. Dis-
 entangling the effects of HIV stigma can be challenging and is perhaps limited by our media-
 tion framework. Community HIV stigma was posited to be on the causal pathway between the
 intervention and outcome, but it is possible, for example, that changes in community concern
 for HIV might first be necessary to reduce stigma. Further, community HIV stigma may have
 a bidirectional relationship with the outcome, with reduced stigma increasing uptake of
 HIVST and further normalising HIV testing and reducing stigma. In the context of a multiple
 component intervention with simultaneous multilevel impacts, the challenge of establishing
 causal effects could be addressed by prospectively measuring variables at sequential timepoints
 [15].
 A strength of our study is the use of recent mediation methods to evaluate mechanisms of
 action underlying the effect of a complex intervention and their relative contribution to
 changes in the outcome. We used statistical techniques that extend traditional mediation
 approaches to allow for a binary outcome and intervention-mediator interaction. We also
 assessed mediation effects within a cluster-randomised design. By randomising the interven-
 tion, the study design minimises confounding and accounts for temporality assumptions
 between the intervention and mediator and the intervention and outcome, satisfying certain
 conditions important for causal interpretation [15]. Further, lessons from our study can poten-
 tially be applied to self-care interventions that involve and empower community groups in
 similar settings.
 A limitation of our study is the use of a cross-sectional survey to measure the outcome,
 potential mediators, and mediator-outcome confounders, meaning the assumption that the
 mediator precedes the outcome was not automatically satisfied by the study design. For exam-
 ple, it is possible that engaging in HIV testing might affect an individual’s perception of shared
 HIV concern or community HIV stigma. To account for the direction of causality, we ideally
 would have measured the potential mediators and outcome in temporal order. The assump-
 tion that the intervention does not impact mediator-outcome confounders may also not be
 completely satisfied, though we aimed to select variables that conceptually were less likely be
 affected by the intervention. We also did not measure the potential mediators prior to the 
<section> intervention and adjust for their levels at baseline, which may be a source of unmeasured
 mediator-outcome confounding. Sensitivity analysis can account for the respective associa-
 tions between unmeasured confounders and the mediator and outcome and their impact on
 effect estimates [45]. We reported a lack of association between the potential mediators and
 outcome in the SOC arm, which could function as a proxy for baseline estimates and indicates
 that our conclusions would be unlikely to change.
 Our mediation framework also assessed a single mediator variable at a time but did not
 evaluate direct and indirect effects based on a combined set of mediators [46]. Given that we
 did not find evidence of an indirect effect for each mediator, we would be unlikely to observe
 combined effect. We also did not account for whether the potential mediators affected other
 mediators of interest on the causal pathway [46], including the possibility that changes in com-
 munity mobilisation domains might be requisite for changes in community HIV stigma. Final
 limitations concern the measurement of outcomes and potential mediators. Measures for com-
 munity mobilisation and community HIV stigma were based on perceived rather than experi-
 enced constructs and represent individual perceptions within the community [28]. We also
 only used a subset of domains of community mobilisation from a previously validated score
 [28]. Finally, our data were self-reported, which may have resulted in overestimation of out-
 comes and mediators in the community-led HIVST arm due to recall or social desirability
 bias.
 Community-led delivery of HIVST increased uptake of recent HIV testing, with the inter-
 vention effect predominantly occurring through direct pathways rather than indirectly by
 modifying individual perceptions of community mobilisation and community HIV stigma.
 The community-led HIVST intervention apparently increased perceived shared concern for
 HIV and social cohesion, which alongside perceived critical consciousness had a protective
 effect on recent testing in the intervention arm but only at lower ranges of scores. By investi-
 gating mediation effects, we were able to evaluate factors important for optimising commu-
 nity-led HIV interventions. Our findings suggest that the impact of the community-led
 HIVST intervention mainly stemmed from community-driven service delivery rather than by
 modifying social and structural determinants of HIV. More frequent or active community par-
 ticipation might be required to achieve changes in community mobilisation and other social
 enablers as mechanisms for improving HIV-related outcomes. Trade-offs between immediate
 economic costs and building more sustainable community responses for HIV prevention,
 however, would need to be considered.
