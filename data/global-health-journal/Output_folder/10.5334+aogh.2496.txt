<section> Introduction
 The rise in obesity, diabetes and an aging population
 raises concern for future incidence and prevalence of
 cardiovascular disease (CVD). Primary prevention of CVD
 through risk factor reduction may reduce future burden
 [1–3]. Innovative measures to improve cardiovascular
 health are needed with nine potentially modifiable risk
 factors accounting for over 90% of the population attrib-
 utable risk of a first myocardial infarction based on the
 findings from the INTERHEART Study [4]. Cochrane sys-
 tematic reviews have concluded that interventions using
 counselling and education aimed at behavior change
 do not reduce mortality or clinical events in the general
 population but may be effective in reducing mortality

<section> in high risk populations [5]. There is some evidence that
 behavior change using computer tailoring can be effec-
 tive in changing lifestyle and risk factors [6–8]. Internet
 and email access have increased globally and electronic
 (e-) coaching may aid preventative strategies, potentially
 allowing efficient, easy to use and cost-effective ways to
 improve the health and wellbeing of many. E-coaching
 may encourage individuals to improve lifestyle factors
 through identifying individual needs, setting personal-
 ized goals, using strategies to support change and rein-
 forcement during the process [6]. This may be possible
 without overburdening existing healthcare facilities and
 encourage self-care and autonomy in managing personal
 health. The use of e-coaching has been applied to single
 risk factor modification with variable but mostly posi-
 tive findings with dietary behavior change [9], increas-
 ing physical activity [10], and smoking cessation [11].
 Though no differences were seen when addressing mul-
 tiple risk factors in patients with familial hypercholester-
 olemia [12].
 The Heart Attack Prevention Program for You (HAPPY)
 initially provided generic lifestyle e-coaching in a Dutch
 population over 3 months [13]. Participants with inter-
 mediate to high CVD risk (n = 141) were followed over
 12 months with a relative reduction in CVD risk of 13.8%
 using the PROCAM risk score. The study did not have a
 control group and was not randomized. 
<section> Aim
 
<section> To assess the clinical effectiveness of personalized e-coach-
 ing as a primary prevention tool to reduce CVD risk in
 individuals with increased 10-year CVD risk.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 The HAPPY London trial was a single-center, two-arm ran-
 domized controlled trial with 1:1 allocation to e-coach-
 ing and SOC versus SOC alone, stratified into moderate
 (QRISK2 10–20%) and high-risk (QRISK2 ≥ 20%), (Clinical-
 
<section> Trials.gov: NCT01911910). From June 2013 to November
 2014, 402 adults were recruited based on guideline rec-
 ommended risk scores to identify individuals at increased
 risk of developing CVD to facilitate risk reduction [14–16].
 Follow-up was for 6 months with a final visit in May 2015.
 The study was not blinded.
 
<section> Participants
 Participants were aged between 40 and 74 years and had
 a 10-year CVD risk score of 10% or higher based on the
 UK validated QRISK2 score [17]. They needed to have easy
 access (i.e. home computer, mobile phone, local library)
 to the Internet and email and have sufficient fluency of
 the English language to understand and comply with the
 written and verbal advice. Participants were excluded if
 they had established CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke
 or angina) or life-threatening conditions.
 Recruitment was primarily by postal invitation for
 potentially eligible individuals identified from primary
 care database searches. Potential participants completed
 a registration and screening questionnaire on the study
 website (www.happylondon.info) to check eligibility.
 Screening visit was booked using online scheduling.
 Three subsequent visits took place at the William Harvey
 Heart Centre; baseline (within 2 weeks of screening visit),
 3-months and 6-months from baseline. Randomization
 occurred prior to the baseline visit. Email appointment
 reminders were sent prior to visits. Assessments included
 lifestyle (including detailed dietary intake) and quality
 of life questionnaires (EQ-5D-3L, SF-36, recent physical
 activity questionnaire [RPAQ]), blood pressure (BP, Omron
 705IT, Omron Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), blood tests, fol-
 lowing an 8-hour fast (lipid profile, glucose, high sensi-
 tive C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and estimated glomerular
 filtration rate [eGFR]), carotid ultrasound scan (Panasonic
 Cardio Health System, Panasonic Healthcare Co. Ltd,
 Yokohama, Japan) and oscillometric method to assess
 PWV and pulse wave analysis (Vicorder device, Skidmore
 Medical, UK).
 All participants gave written informed consent. The
 study was approved by the national Research Ethics
 Committee (NRES committee – London, REC reference
 13/LO/0094) and was conducted in accordance with the
 declaration of Helsinki.
 
<section> Patient and Public Involvement
 Patients and public were involved during trial design
 including assessing feasibility of taking part in a lifestyle
 intervention trial with requirement for internet access,
 reviewing and providing feedback on the patient informa-
 tion sheet, consent form, and advertisement posters.
 
<section> Randomization
 Randomization was performed using an in-house soft-
 ware tool with allocation sequence concealment using
 two strata. Randomization into the treatment or control
 group was performed after confirming eligibility (see sup-
 plementary material for more details).
 
<section> Intervention
 E-coaching involved computer-tailoring, a method of
 assessing individuals’ suboptimal lifestyle and risk factors
 and selecting communication content using data-driven
 decision rules that produce feedback automatically from
 a database of content options. Participants had personal
 logins and passwords. Written information was provided
 on the website with links to other sites and online videos.
 The HAPPY London web-based tool provided a personal-
 ized score for their lifestyle and 10-year CVD risk score,
 provided tailored advice and information specifically
 for those suboptimal factors that were relevant to that
 participants. Ideal targets were highlighted as goals and
 then updated following 3 and 6 months visits, providing
 dynamic tailoring to increase efficacy [6]. Dynamic tailor-
 ing entailed updating the participants lifestyle and risk
 factor profiles and personalized advice based on the fol-
 low-up assessments. Additional regular email reminders
 were sent to encourage achievement of goals. The email
 reminders were correlated to the number of suboptimal
 factors. Participants received instructions on how to use
 the website, lasting 5–10 minutes during the baseline
 visit. The web team (web developers and programmers)
 developed the content with input from the research team
 members (MYK and SEP).
 
<section> Standard of Care
 All participants received personalized face-to-face coun-
 selling on suboptimal lifestyle and cardiovascular risk
 factors based on guideline recommendations once dur-
 ing the baseline visit, lasting 10–15 minutes [15]. All
 participants completed a lifestyle questionnaire. Advice
 on factors including blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose
 readings, smoking, weight, physical activity, fruit, and veg-
 etable intake, alcohol intake and stress was provided by a
 trained physician (MYK).
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> Primary outcome was baseline to 6-months PWV change.
 Secondary outcomes included changes in BP, weight, cho-
 lesterol, glucose, hsCRP, carotid intima media thickness,
 quality of life, Framingham risk score, QRISK2 scores, and
 self-reported physical activity using the validated RPAQ.
 
<section> Pulse Wave Velocity
 Carotid femoral PWV and augmentation index, mark-
 ers of global arterial stiffness, were measured using the
 Vicorder device. Measurements were obtained by placing
 a 10cm wide blood pressure cuff around the upper left
 thigh measuring the femoral pulse and a 3cm partial cuff 
<section> around the neck at the level of the left carotid artery. The
 path-length was calculated according to manufacturer’s
 instructions, from suprasternal notch to a defined point
 on the upper part of the femoral cuff. The cuffs were
 inflated simultaneously to 65 mmHg with 2 high quality
 waveforms simultaneously recorded for 3 seconds using
 a volume displacement method. The foot-to-foot transit
 time was measured and values for carotid-femoral PWV
 were derived automatically by the software (Supplemen-
 tary Figure 1). The average of 2 PWV measures was used.
 
<section> Cardiovascular risk calculation
 A 10-year QRISK2 risk score was calculated once blood
 results were available at baseline, three-month, and six-
 month visits. Due to changes in the QRISK2 algorithm
 during the study period we recalculated this for all visits
 at the end of the study using the most up-to-date QRISK2
 (https://qrisk.org) algorithm for standardization.
 
<section> Sample size calculation
 Sample size calculation was based on a two-sample t-test
 with equal variances. The Type I error was set at 5% (two-
 sided). The standard deviation of 0.29 m/s for Vicorder
 measured PWV were based on published inter-study
 reproducibility data [18]. We proposed a sample size of
 200 patients in each treatment arm assuming a dropout
 rate of 15–20% at the follow-up visit and having 80%
 power to detect a 0.1 m/s difference in PWV between the
 treatment groups (Supplementary Table 1).
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 Analysis was performed on an intention to treat basis
 using R statistical software (version 3.4.4). Mean ± stand-
 ard deviation was used for normally distributed variables.
 Median and interquartile ranges were used for data not
 normally distributed. T-test was used for normally distrib-
 uted continuous measures and chi-square for categorical
 variables. Where variables were not normally distributed
 non-parametric tests were used (Wilcoxon rank sum test).
 Six-month changes in PWV and other parameters between
 treatment and control arms were compared for statistical
 difference. Agreement between repeated measurements
 was analyzed using student’s paired t-test. Reproducibil-
 ity was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient and
 Bland-Altman Plots. Regression analysis was used to assess
 for potential covariates that predicted PWV change.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> The online ‘mini-check’ for eligibility was completed by
 891 people and 501 fulfilled the preliminary inclusion cri-
 teria and accepted invitation for participation. Of these,
 402 had a QRISK2 score of 10% or more and were ran-
 domized (see 
<section> Figure 1, CONSORT flow diagram). Mean
 age was 65.5 ± 5.6 years and 37% were females. Median
 10-year QRISK2 score was 16.5% and mean Framingham
 Risk score was 17.5%. Demographics and baseline charac-
 teristics including CVD risk factors are included in 
<section> Table 1.
 
<section> The proportion of participants with a high QRISK2 score
 was similar in both the e-coaching and SOC groups (36%
 vs. 31%). During the study there were no important harms
 or unintended effects experienced by the participants (see
 Supplementary Table 2 for full study CONSORT checklist).
 The only reason for not being randomized into the
 study was having a 10-year QRISK2 score of less than 10%.
 During the study 24 participants (6%) dropped out and
 did not have follow-up measurements (11 from e-coach-
 ing group and 13 from the SOC). Following baseline
 assessment, statin medication was initiated in 12 versus
 individuals and antihypertensive medication was initiated
 in 4 versus 4 individuals in the e-coaching and SOC group,
 respectively, by their primary care physician.
 After 6 months there was no significant difference in
 the reduction in the PWV between the e-coaching (–0.16
 m/s) and SOC groups (–0.25 m/s), mean difference
 between groups 0.09 m/s, 95 % confidence interval (CI)
 –0.39 to 0.22, p = 0.56, Cohen’s d = 0.05 (Figure 2). Even
 when baseline difference was adjusted, there remained no
 difference in the 6-month PWV between the e-coaching
 and SOC groups –0.017 m/s vs –0.025 m/s, CI –0.029;
 0.044, p = 0.679.
 
<section> Table 2 summarizes the changes seen at follow up
 in each group. There were similar modest improve-
 ments seen between the e-coaching and SOC, including
 improved systolic BP, diastolic BP, weight, hip circumfer-
 ence, waist circumference, fasting total cholesterol, fast-
 ing LDL cholesterol, fasting triglyceride, fasting glucose,
 and a reduction in the 10-year Framingham Risk score
 (see Supplementary Table 3 for baseline and six-month
 differences in each group and Supplementary Figure 2 for
 trends in changes from baseline and the three-month and
 six-month visits). Lifestyle improvements were also seen
 in both groups, including a reduction in alcohol intake,
 increased moderate physical activity, measured as min-
 utes per week averaged over a five-day week (25 minutes
 vs. 8 minutes, p = 0.54), and an improved overall lifestyle
 score which considered a number of lifestyle factors, with
 the best possible score of 10 (0.74 vs. 0.66, p = 0.45). There
 was also an improvement in the proportion of participants
 achieving guideline-based targets for risk factors includ-
 ing systolic BP, diastolic BP, BMI, cholesterol levels, waist
 circumference and achieving over 150 minutes moder-
 ate physical activity per week which was similar in both
 groups (Supplementary Table 4).
 Self-rated health state scores improved for both groups.
 The sum of the visual analogue scale value, which pro-
 vides an indexed value based on the combination of the
 5 dimensions of the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, did not
 show any change over the study period either within or
 between the groups. There was no reduction in mean
 carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) over 6-months
 in either group. The mean number logins to the HAPPY
 London website was 13 for the e-coaching group over the
 six-month study period.
 Univariate analysis showed that a higher level of educa-
 tion was a predictor of more favorable change in PWV only
 in the e-coaching group (–0.37 (0.18), p = 0.04). Change in
 PWV was not associated with age, gender, presence of dia-
 betes or hypertension, baseline QRISK2 score, or the total
 number of logins to the website in either the e-coaching
 or SOC groups. 
<insert> Figure 1: CONSORT flow diagram for the HAPPY London study.
 The reproducibility of PWV was good. The difference
 between repeated PWV measurements was –0.14 +/–
 0.5 m/s (p = 0.38) with limits of agreement of –1.10 to
 0.82 m/s and intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.89
 (p < 0.001).

<section> Discussion
 To our knowledge this is the first study to assess the impact
 of personalized e-coaching in a high-risk primary preven-
 tion cohort using robust cardiovascular surrogate mark-
 ers. This study showed that e-coaching, using Internet and
 email-based heart attack prevention program on top of
 the SOC, compared with SOC alone did not further reduce
 cardiovascular risk based on interval change of the PWV
 surrogate marker and other CVD risk markers. E-coaching
 and SOC both modestly improved PWV and a number of
 cardiovascular risk factors that translated in a reduced esti-
 mated 10-year CVD risk based on QRISK2 and Framingham
 scores. Similar to previous studies, the frequency of logins
 to the website was low in the e-coaching group suggest-
 ing low degree of engagement with the online content.
 Given previous studies showing similar low engagement
 with website information, we had pre-emptively provided
 personalized emails as encouragement and reminders and
 the option of nominating a ‘buddy’ to help with motiva-
 tion, to complement the website content.
 Higher level of education was associated with favorable
 reduction in PWV in the e-coaching group. The potential
 reasons for this may be linked to better understanding of
 the content and better means and ability to implement
 lifestyle modification.
 
<section> Impact of Electronic Coaching in Prevention
 Previous outcomes of e-coaching studies have been varied
 and the end points, designs, and strategies utilized have
 been heterogeneous. Limited studies exist in primary CVD
 prevention. A meta-analysis assessing the effectiveness of
 Internet-based interventions targeting participants with
 increased CVD risk identified five randomized controlled
 trials in diabetic patients and four in those with increased
 CVD risk predominantly due to high BP. Authors noted
 shortage of studies investigating the effectiveness of Inter-
 net-based interventions on direct CVD outcomes such as
 cardiac mortality or adverse events. They noted some evi-
 dence suggesting that interactive self-management pro-
 grams that include lifestyle education and self-monitoring

 of health behaviors may be of benefit in improving some
 clinical CVD risk factors such as BP [19]. However, most
 studies concentrated on patients with either diabetes or
 hypertension.
 Studies assessing the impact of smart phones and wear-
 able mobile technology in CVD risk reduction are limited
 and, where available, often rely on self-reporting and do
 not conform to an intention to treat analysis [20]. A recent
 study in young adults with increased weight found that
 the addition of wearable technology to standard behav-
 ioral intervention resulted in less weight loss over 2 years
 suggesting that devices that monitor and provide feed-
 back on physical activity may not offer an advantage over
 standard behavioral weight loss approaches [21].
 Optimum follow-up period is debatable. Studies with
 follow-up of 6-months or less with weight loss have shown

 group differences [22]. Six-month follow-up was selected
 to capture sustainability of behavioral changes allowing
 time for detectable effects to take place. Longer follow-up
 beyond six months may have been informative for longer-
 term differences, although this seems unlikely to change
 the findings based on the 3- and 6-month trends showing
 convergence in the primary end point of PWV between
 the two groups (Supplementary Figure 2).
 Primary prevention studies generally require long fol-
 low-up and large participant numbers to powerfully detect
 hard cardiac end points. This creates obvious resource
 and administrative challenges. Use of robust surrogate
 markers can help identify potentially useful interven-
 tions that can then be further studied. We therefore used
 PWV which is one of the most validated method to non-
 invasively measure arterial stiffness and is recognized as a

<section> surrogate marker for future cardiovascular events [23]. It
 is considered the gold standard index of aortic stiffness,
 as it is a relatively simple method with reported accuracy,
 reproducibility and an independent and strong predictor
 of adverse outcomes [24, 25]. There is however only weak
 indirect evidence of change in PWV and long-term out-
 comes [26]. A study is under way to clarify this gap [27].
 Finally, we only assessed the impact of adding e-coaching
 to SOC but did not test whether it could be effective when
 used as a part replacement to some SOC visits.
 Our study included individuals who had high total cardi-
 ovascular risk. CVD risk assessment, using risk calculators
 to guide management, is now widely advocated in many
 primary prevention guidelines [14–16]. Our study utilized
 robust and sensitive surrogate markers, which confirmed
 that risk reduction programs have a modest improve-
 ment in future risk in general, but no additional clinical
 benefit with the addition of e-coaching. It may be argued
 that more information may provide motivation for future
 change or increase awareness of risk factors and health
 information. However, in resource limited healthcare sys-
 tems rationalization occurs, with resources diverted from
 interventions that do not show objective benefit towards
 those with evidence of effectiveness.
 
<section> Strengths and Limitations
 Our study is one of the largest of its kind and included a
 variety of sensitive measures to evaluate outcomes. The
 Internet tool and email reminders incorporated aspects of
 e-coaching that have shown benefit including personaliza-
 tion, dynamic feedback, goal setting and incorporation of
 social media. We had a very low drop-out rate of only 6%.
 There were some limitations to our study. Researchers
 were not blinded and although we were strict in follow-
 ing the pre-specified protocol this may have led to pos-
 sible bias. The adherence to the website segment of the
 e-coaching tool was low. We had anticipated this and
 added complementary features such as email reminders
 to overcome this known issue. Mobile phone applications
 and platform optimization may increase participant inter-
 action with the e-coaching and may improve effective-
 ness. Volunteering effect may have been present and our
 cohort represented more Caucasians, males, and those
 with higher educational qualifications than the general
 London population, thus making generalizability chal-
 lenging. Only people with Internet access were eligible
 which may have created a selection bias.
 
<section> Conclusions
 In individuals at increased cardiovascular risk, a comprehen-
 sive ‘health check’ program modestly reduced future risk.
 Personalized e-coaching did not provide added risk reduc-
 tion. Currently there is no evidence to routinely recom-
 mend e-coaching in cardiovascular health check programs.
 
<section> Transparency Declaration

 est, accurate, and transparent account of the study being
 reported; that no important aspect of the study has been
 omitted; and that any discrepancies from the study as
 planned and registered have been explained.
 
<section> What is already known on this topic
 Rising obesity, diabetes and aging population is likely to
 lead to increased incidence and prevalence of cardiovascu-
 lar disease, which is already a leading cause of morbidity
 and mortality.
 Interventions using counselling and education for
 behavior change do not reduce mortality or clinical events
 in the general population but may be effective in high
 risk population.
 There is some evidence that electronic coaching can
 be effective in improving lifestyle and risk factors when
 addressing single risk factors.
 
<section> What this study adds
 Face to face counselling for lifestyle and risk factors from
 a health care professional provides modest improvements
 in cardiovascular risk.
 Electronic coaching, using personalized website and
 email reminders, does not provide additional risk reduc-
 tion when added to standard of care in individuals consid-
 ered at high risk. Although participants with higher levels
 of education may derive some benefit.
 
<section> How might this impact on clinical practice
 We found no evidence to routinely recommend electronic
 coaching on top of current standard of care in primary
 prevention programs for individuals at increased risk.
 Digital and mobile health systems should undergo care-
 ful evaluation for effectiveness before being rolled out in
 prevention or health and wellbeing programs particularly
 given resource constraints.
