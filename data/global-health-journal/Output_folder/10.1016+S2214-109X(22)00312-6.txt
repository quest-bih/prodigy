<section> Evidence before this study
 WHO recommends that midwives and physicians can provide
 care for first trimester incomplete abortion. Our trial in 2015
 provided evidence that post-abortion care with misoprostol
 provided by midwives is equally effective and safe as when
 provided by physicians. We searched PubMed, Web of Science,
 and LISTA for articles published in English from database
 inception to Feb 1, 2022, with the keywords “incomplete
 abortion”, “post abortion care”, “second trimester”,
 “misoprostol”, “task sharing”, “midlevel providers”, and “non-
 physicians”. There was no evidence of a randomised clinical trial
 comparing the effectiveness and safety of the management of
 second trimester incomplete abortion provided by midwives
 with that provided by physicians.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 Our study findings show that midwives can manage
 uncomplicated second trimester incomplete abortions using
 effectively manage first trimester incomplete abortion
 with misoprostol and manual vacuum aspiration. 9–11
 However, there is limited evidence regarding the role
 midwives have in the management of second trimester
 incomplete abortion, 12 and no international recom­
 mendations exist that support task sharing between
 physicians and midwives in this gestation period.
 Uganda is a low-income country with a low
 contraceptive prevalence rate of 39% in married women,
 a high total fertility rate (5·4 children per woman), and
 28% of married women have an unmet need for
 contraception. 14 High rates of unintended pregnancies
 combined with restrictive abortion laws force women
 into unsafe abortion, which is defined as “a procedure for
 terminating an unintended pregnancy, carried out either
 by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an
 environment that does not conform to minimal medical
 standards, or both.” 3 An estimated 130 000 women have
 abortion-related complications in Uganda annually, 15 and
 8% of maternal deaths are related to abortion. Harmful
 abortion practices, stigma, delayed health-care-seeking
 behaviour, and insufficient resources exacerbate post-
 abortion complications.
 Task sharing is an important strategy to enhance
 continuity of service delivery in countries such as Uganda
 where doctors and physicians are scarce. 9 Midwives are
 often the key providers of post-abortion care in the first
 trimester, and mainly consulting physicians if a patient’s
 condition worsens. 16 The current Ministry of Health
 policy in Uganda allows both midwives and physicians to
 manage women with first trimester incomplete abortions,
 but defers management of second trimester incomplete
 abortion to physicians. 17 However, there are challenges
 with accessing physician-only services, especially in the
 remote areas in which equitable service delivery is
 repeat doses of misoprostol and, hence, support task sharing
 to midwives. Although the assumption is that most cases of
 post-abortion care in the second trimester are complicated
 and require surgical evacuation, our study suggests that
 93% of women can have a complete abortion from
 misoprostol treatment.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 Programming for improved accessibility of post-abortion care
 should consider including midwives in the provision of
 services, not only for first trimester abortion care but also
 second trimester abortion care. We need efforts that focus on
 implementation, in which midwives are enabled and
 encouraged to take on this task with appropriate (pre-service
 and in-service) training and support so that access to services
 is improved while quality is sustained.
 
<section> affected. Building on lessons learnt from our trial in first
 trimester post-abortion care, 11 we aimed to compare the
 effectiveness and safety of treatment outcomes for
 incomplete second trimester abortion with misoprostol
 provided by midwives versus provision by physicians in
 Uganda.
 
<section> Methods
 Study design and participants
 This study used a multicentre, randomised, controlled,
 equivalence design to compare the effectiveness and
 safety of second trimester incomplete abortion clinically
 assessed and treated with misoprostol provided by
 midwives with that provided by physicians. 10 months
 after trial commencement, we increased the number of
 study sites from eight to 14 to increase study participant
 recruitment. No other substantial change was made to
 the protocol. 18 The trial and study protocol adhered to the
 CONSORT guidelines for reporting non-inferiority and
 equivalence randomised trials. 19 We included women
 with symptoms and signs of incomplete abortion (eg,
 vaginal bleeding, uterine contractions, partial expulsion,
 and an open cervical os) and a uterine size of 13–18 weeks
 of gestation. Women were excluded if they met any of
 the following exclusion criteria: younger than 15 years;
 known allergy to misoprostol; unstable haemodynamic
 status (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) and shock;
 signs of pelvic infection or sepsis, or both; previous
 caesarean delivery or a uterine scar; suspected
 extrauterine pregnancy; perforation of the uterus; injury
 to the surrounding organs; heavy vaginal bleeding;
 severe abdominal pain; cervical tear; body temperature
 higher than 38°C; and current molar abortion. 18 Previous
 misoprostol studies for post-abortion care have used
 similar criteria for participant eligibility. 10,11

<section> Outcomes
 The primary outcome was a complete abortion without
 any surgical intervention within 24 h of treatment
 initiation. Clinical assessment of the primary outcome
 included physical and pelvic examination with attainment
 of a complete abortion based on cessation of uterine
 cramps and vaginal bleeding, and a closed cervical os.
 Secondary outcomes measured at the initial visit were
 time from induction (first dose of misoprostol) to
 completion of abortion and total dose of misoprostol
 given. Secondary outcomes assessed at a 2-week
 follow-up visit to measure safety comprised the following:
 excessive vaginal bleeding (soaking more than three pads
 in 1 h); abdominal pain (discomfort in the lower
 abdomen) and its intensity (measured with a visual
 analogue scale; minimum score of 0 representing no
 pain and maximum score of 10 representing most pain);

 of severe adverse events, such as hospitalisation for more
 than 48 h, blood transfusion, disability or incapacity, life-

 serious adverse event form at the end of each case report
 form.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 We computed the sample size with the objective of
 establishing two-sided equivalence if both groups had a
 90% complete abortion rate at 24 h within a 10% equivalence
 margin. At 80% power, taking into account two-sided
 95% CI, set actual difference D1 range of –5% to 5%,
 smallest difference of 0·001, design effect of 1, and 5%
 level of significance, we required 566 women in each
 group. PASS software (version 14) was used for statistical
 analysis. Considering a 5% loss to follow-up, we had a
 sample size of 1192 women. The Data Safety Monitoring
 Board performed an interim analysis on 55% accrued
 sample in August, 2020, to assess safety, and there were no
 significant differences between both groups.
 We entered data into EpiData (version 3.1) and analysed
 with Stata (version 14). We used complete-case analysis
 given that we had minimal missing data (<1%). We
 defined the intention-to-treat population as all women
 who were randomised, received at least one dose of
 misoprostol, and reported primary outcome data. The
 per-protocol population excluded women with
 unexplained discontinuation of treatment. Background
 characteristics of the study participants and post-abortion
 care providers were analysed and presented with
 descriptive statistics. Categorical data were presented as
 proportions whereas continuous data were presented as
 means and SDs if normally distributed, and medians and
 IQRs if not normally distributed. To determine
 differences in participants’ background characteristics
 between the two study groups, we used the χ² test for
 categorical data, the Student’s t-test for normally
 distributed continuous data, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum
 test when continuous data were not normally distributed.
 Analysis of the primary outcome (complete abortion)
 between the midwife and physician groups was done
 using risk difference with 95% CIs. Equivalence was
 established if the risk difference lay between the
 predefined range of –5% and 5%. A p value of 0·05 or
 less was considered statistically significant. To cater for
 differences in performance between the sites, we used a
 generalised linear mixed-effects model with health-care
 provider as a fixed effect and health-care facility as a
 random effect. Further, we used the backward regression
 model fitting technique starting with covariates: study
 group, age, marital status, religion, education level,
 occupation, number of pregnancies, and number of 
<insert> the physician group and 593 to the midwife group
 (figure 1). Four study participants were excluded; one
 woman in the physician’s group did not receive the
 intervention, and two women in the physician group and
 one woman in midwife group had incomplete primary
 outcome data. The two women in the physician group
 left the facility against medical advice; one woman
 returned at the 2-week follow-up and had surgical
 evacuation, and the other woman had an ongoing
 pregnancy when contacted 3 weeks later. The one woman
 in the midwife group had heavy bleeding and was
 referred to another facility because the physician was not
 on site to perform the evacuation.
 We included 1187 women in the intention-to-treat
 analysis (595 in the physician group and 592 in the
 midwife group). We further excluded 23 women (eight in

 trimester incomplete abortion who would benefit from
 using misoprostol. 3,20 In our trial, 93% of the midwives
 had confidence in using misoprostol, which could be
 attributed to their extensive experience with first
 trimester post-abortion care. Yet, only 48% of midwives
 had confidence in using manual vacuum aspiration,

 approach in the diagnosis of complete abortion has been

<section> not improve patient outcomes and inadvertently increases
 surgical procedures. 22 Our study findings are therefore
 easily replicable in daily patient care points, particularly in
 settings with limited access to ultrasound services.
 Our results indicate that 75% of the women with
 incomplete abortion needed only three doses of
 misoprostol given at a median duration of 6·1 h. WHO’s
 2018 guideline on medical management of abortion
 recommends one dose of misoprostol every 3 h for
 second trimester incomplete abortion at the discretion of
 the health-care practitioner. 23 Our study used a maximum
 of five doses of misoprostol, 3 and 23% of 1137 women
 reported misoprostol-related side-effects. Side-effects are
 likely to occur more frequently with repeated and higher
 total doses of misoprostol. Although a concern, side-
 effects are known and manageable, 24 especially if women
 receive adequate information and counselling to allay
 any concerns and ensure treatment adherence. In our
 study, 23 women prematurely received a surgical
 evacuation. During our supervisory visits, health-care
 practitioners cited drivers, such as monetary gain and
 impatience of the staff, which we addressed during
 several engagement meetings with the health-care
 practitioners. Notably, women with tertiary education or
 those who were self-employed had statistically significant
 shorter durations of treatment, which could suggest a
 better understanding of the treatment procedure and
 better adherence to the treatment protocol given that this
 was an effectiveness study. Notably, self-employed
 women might be motivated to adhere to the treatment
 procedures so that they can recover quickly and return to
 their work for earning.
 Haemorrhage and sepsis are generally known as the
 most frequent severe abortion-related morbidities. 3 The
 rate of post-abortion pelvic infections in our study (1%) is
 similar to previous studies on first trimester post-abortion
 care. 10 Given that the second trimester is associated
 with more severe abortion-related complications, 6,25 we
 established strategies to prevent complications, such as
 careful screening for study eligibility, provision of
 prophylactic antibiotics, and ensuring attainment of the
 outcome before discharge, which could have contributed
 to the low rate of pelvic infection. About 50% of the
 women bled for 2–4 days after treatment, and most
 described their bleeding during treatment as less than
 normal menstrual bleeding. All women with treatment
 failures had surgical evacuations performed by a physician
 before discharge. 18 This approach ensured patient safety,
 allayed health-care practitioners’ concerns on probable
 outcomes, and is easily replicable in clinical practice.
 Although our study reports a low median pain score of
 experienced by women during treatment, only 70% of the
 women received analgesics. As shown in previous
 studies, 6,7 there are often shortages of drugs and supplies
 at public health facilities, especially those with large
 caseloads. Our study made an effort to avail some drugs at
 the health facilities that lacked them but there might be
 occasions when women are not given the available drugs,
 which could depict abortion-related stigma.
 The strengths of this study are a large sample of
 1187 women with second trimester incomplete abortions
 from 14 public health facilities, a randomised-controlled
 design, and assessment of the primary outcome at the
 initial visit reducing loss to follow-up. We assessed
 effectiveness rather than efficacy, to ensure easy
 replicability of study findings in clinical routine care at
 similar settings.
 The study had some limitations. Women were
 randomly assigned to health-care practitioners who work
 closely at the post-abortion care sites and within the
 same environment, which could cause convergence of
 the outcome. Second trimester post-abortion care is
 typically offered by physicians rather than midwives,
 which could influence attitudes and technical expertise.
