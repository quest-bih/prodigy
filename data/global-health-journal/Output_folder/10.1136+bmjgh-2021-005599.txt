<section> ABSTRACT
 
<section> Introduction Household air pollution from solid fuel
 combustion for cooking and heating is a leading cause
 of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. We
 hypothesised that clean cooking interventions delivered
 during pregnancy would improve child health.
 
<section> Methods We conducted a cluster randomised trial in
 rural Ghana to test whether providing pregnant women
 liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cookstoves or improved
 biomass cookstoves would reduce personal carbon
 monoxide and fine particulate pollution exposure,
 increase birth weight and reduce physician-­assessed
 severe pneumonia in the first 12 months of life,
 compared with control participants who continued
 to cook with traditional stoves. Primary analyses
 were intention-­to-­treat. The trial was registered with ​
 ClinicalTrials.​gov and follow-­up is complete.
 
<section> Results Enrolment began on 14 April 2014, and
 ended on 20 August 2015. We enrolled 1414 pregnant
 women; 361 in the LPG arm, 527 in the improved
 biomass cookstove arm and 526 controls. We saw no
 improvement in birth weight (the difference in mean
 birth weight for LPG arm births was 29 g lighter (95%
 CI −113 to 56, p=0.51) and for improved biomass arm
 births was 9 g heavier (95% CI −64 to 82, p=0.81),
 compared with control newborns) nor severe child
 pneumonia (the rate ratio for pneumonia in the LPG
 arm was 0.98 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.70; p=0.95) and for
 the improved biomass arm was 1.21 (95% CI 0.78 to
 1.90; p=0.52), compared with the control arm). Air
 pollution exposures in the LPG arm remained above
 WHO health-­based targets (LPG median particulate
 matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM ) 45 µg/
 
<section> 2.5
 m³; IQR 32–65 vs control median PM 67 µg/m³, IQR
 
<section> 2.5
 
<section> 46–97).
 
<section> Conclusions Neither prenatally-­introduced LPG nor
 improved biomass cookstoves improved birth weight or
 reduced severe pneumonia risk in the first 12 months of
 life. We hypothesise that this is due to lower-­than-­expected
 exposure reductions in the intervention arms.

<section> Key questions
 
<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► Air pollution exposure arising from cooking with bio-
 mass fuels is a major driver of disease and mortality
 in low-­income and middle-­income countries (LMICs),
 and better evidence is needed to guide and to justify
 investments in clean household energy transitions.
 
<section> ► Previous randomised controlled cookstove trials
 in Guatemala, Malawi, Peru, Nepal, Nigeria and
 Rwanda, have yielded null results or shown relatively
 small health benefits.
 
<section> ► The notable exception to these small effects is the
 RESPIRE trial in Guatemala, which found that a chimney
 stove intervention resulted in a rate ratio of 0.67 (95% CI
 0.45 to 0.98) for severe physician diagnosed pneumonia.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► In a cluster randomised controlled trial, we tested the
 ability of clean stoves and fuels to reduce household
 air pollution exposures and to improve child health.
 
<section> ► Our study enrolled pregnant women into three arms: a
 liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) arm (which provided both
 stoves and monthly free fuel deliveries), an improved
 biomass stove arm and a control arm.
 
<section> ► In both intention-­to-­treat and in adjusted analyses,
 we found no evidence of benefit from either of our
 interventions, though the LPG arm did experience a
 reduction in personal air pollution exposures.
 
<section> What do the new findings imply?
 
<section> ► We contribute to a growing body of evidence from
 randomised controlled trials that suggests that
 household-­level interventions are unlikely to fully
 address health risks from polluting cookstoves.
 
<section> ► Household energy policy in LMICs should focus on
 addressing all sources of air pollution at the commu-
 nity level if it is to generate the air pollution exposure
 reductions necessary to improve health.
 
<section> ► This will require both clean and affordable household
 energy for all, and also strategies to address emissions
 from traffic, trash burning and other sources. 
<section> INTRODUCTION
 In 2019, air pollution caused an estimated 6.7 million
 premature deaths. 1 Household air pollution (HAP)
 from incomplete combustion of solid fuels (wood,
 dung, crop residue and charcoal) in inefficient home
 cookstoves in low-­income and middle-­income countries
 (LMICs) accounts for about one-­third of this mortality
 burden, and in some areas is also an important source
 of ambient air pollution. Systematic reviews have found
 associations between HAP exposure and morbidity and
 mortality across the lifecourse, including reductions in
 birth weight 2 and increased risk for early childhood acute
 lower respiratory illnesses (ALRI), the leading killer of
 children under 5 years of age. 3 In Ghana, approximately
 11 000 deaths and 467 000 disability adjusted life years
 annually are attributed to HAP exposure. Despite this
 burden, evidence regarding the efficacy of a cookstove
 intervention to reduce HAP exposure and improve health
 outcomes is sparse. Previous randomised controlled
 cookstove trials in Guatemala, 4 Malawi, 5 Peru, 6 Nepal
 and Rwanda, 8 have yielded null results or shown small
 health benefits (with the exception of severe pneumonia
 in the RESPIRE trial in Guatemala, which showed mean-
 ingful reductions in severe pneumonia). These trials
 assessed improved biomass-­burning cookstoves and, with
 the exception of the Nepal trial, did not study the use of
 clean fuels.
 We conducted a cluster-­ randomised controlled trial
 in which households with a pregnant woman as primary
 cook were randomised to receive a liquefied petro-
 leum gas (LPG) cookstove, the cleanest household fuel
 available at scale in LMICs, 8 9 a low-­cost, high-­efficiency
 biomass cookstove that allows burning of locally-­available
 fuels or no cookstove intervention. We refer to this study
 as the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health
 Study (GRAPHS). We hypothesised that these cookstove
 interventions would increase birth weight and decrease
 risk of physician-­assessed severe pneumonia in the first
 12 months of life. These outcomes were selected both
 because they are associated with a significant global
 burden of disease, 1 can influence the course of health
 outcomes over the lifespan and because we believed that
 cookstove interventions that target pregnant women
 could, if effective, be deployed through established ante-
 natal care systems. The study was jointly developed by a
 research team from the USA and from Ghana. Ghana
 was an ideal place for this research because solid fuel
 use was—and remains—ubiquitous in rural areas, and
 because Kintampo Health Research Centre (KHRC)
 offered an outstanding platform for scientific collabora-
 tion and study execution.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> Thirty-­ five communities were randomised into three
 study arms (LPG, improved biomass stove and control).
 These communities comprised all population centres in
 the Kintampo North and South districts of Ghana. Pilot
 studies established the feasibility of study procedures and
 demonstrated that intervention cookstoves were capable
 of reducing exposure in controlled settings. Randomisa-
 tion at the level of the community was carried out using
 a coarsened exact matching procedure and was imple-
 mented by an independent statistician. 10 11 The study
 implementation team learnt of community study arm
 allocation after all study personnel were recruited and
 assigned to their respective clusters. Given the cluster-­
 randomised nature of the design and the highly visible
 nature of the intervention, potentially eligible women
 knew their intervention status at the time of recruitment.
 The trial was implemented by a team from the KHRC
 and Columbia University. The trial was undertaken in
 accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol
 was registered with ​ClinicalTrials.​gov, and has been previ-
 ously published. 12 The trial was funded by the National
 Institutes of Health, the Global Alliance for Clean Cook-
 stoves (now known as the Clean Cooking Alliance) and
 the Thrasher Research Fund. The funders played no role
 in study design, collection, analysis and interpretation
 of data, nor manuscript preparation. All of the authors
 vouch for adherence to trial protocol, completeness and
 veracity of data and analyses presented. All of the preg-
 nant women provided written informed consent for their
 and their child’s study participation. Anonymised partici-
 pant data are available on request. No significant changes
 to methods were made after study commencement.
 The selection of the intervention cookstoves was devel-
 oped through extensive piloting and engagement with
 members of the communities where GRAPHS took place.
 Community members also provided feedback on expo-
 sure assessment procedures. Awareness about the health
 risks of HAP is not widespread in our study communities,
 so we did not involve study participants in the choice of
 outcome measures. Results of the study have been shared
 in community meetings, and the investigator team is
 engaged in ongoing research addressing household
 energy policy in Ghana.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> The great majority of households in the study region
 farm for a living and cook with solid fuels. Wood was by
 far the dominant fuel at baseline, with 1334 out of 1414
 participants reporting wood as their primary fuel. The
 balance reported charcoal as the primary fuel (n=56) or
 had missing data (n=9). About half of the study partic-
 ipants (669 out of 1414) reported using charcoal as a
 secondary fuel, and 26 households reported crop residue
 as secondary. The balance of households reported no
 secondary fuel use. Fuel use patterns did not differ
 significantly across study arms. We did not observe any
 LPG, kerosene or electric cooking at baseline. Low
 birth weight and respiratory infections are public health
 concerns in the region. 13 Solid fuel use has remained
 stable over time in rural areas in Ghana, and we observed
 no changes in cooking practices in our control group or 
<section> in non-­intervention households in intervention commu-
 nities. Fieldworkers carried out pregnancy surveillance
 in each study community and referred pregnant women
 to trained midwives for confirmation of pregnancy and
 establishment of gestational age by transabdominal
 ultrasound (SonoSite S180). Study midwives underwent
 intensive pre-­ trial ultrasound training and ongoing
 image review and quality control by a US-­based obstetri-
 cian during the study as previously described. 14 Pregnant
 individuals were eligible to be enrolled if they were the
 primary cook in their household; were pregnant with a
 live, intrauterine fetus; were ≤ ‍ ‍ 4 weeks gestation (to allow
 for delivery of intervention by 28 weeks at the latest);
 and were non-­smokers. Women with a multiple gesta-
 tion identified at the time of the screening ultrasound
 were excluded. Detailed eligibility criteria and screening
 procedures are available in the study protocol. 12 Essen-
 tially all households in our study area relied primarily on
 solid fuels for cooking, so we did not screen for cooking
 fuel at enrolment.
 
<section> Cookstove interventions
 Communities were assigned to one of two cookstove
 interventions or to the control arm (online supplemental
 figure 1). All enrolled participants received a mosquito
 bed net and health insurance. In the LPG interven-
 tion arm, participants received a two-­burner LPG cook-
 stove (Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company, Accra,
 Ghana), two 14.5 kg LPG cylinders, and monthly LPG
 deliveries for the duration of study enrolment at no cost
 to study participants. Additional LPG fuel was available as
 needed. In the improved biomass stove arm, participants
 received two single-­ burner BioLite HomeStove forced
 draft wood fuel cookstoves (BioLite, Brooklyn, New York,
 USA). The improved biomass stove reduces emissions via
 a thermoelectric-­powered fan, which blows air into the
 combustion chamber to improve combustion efficiency,
 and stove geometry, which increases heat transfer effi-
 ciency. The BioLite has a side opening for fuel, and thus
 can accommodate wood fuels similar to those used in the
 traditional three-­stone fires with minimal differences in
 processing. BioLite stoves are not suitable for burning
 charcoal or crop residue. Control participants continued
 to cook with the traditional biomass stoves and fuels.
 Fieldworkers encouraged intervention cookstove use,
 checked stove condition and conducted maintenance
 and repairs as necessary during weekly visits with each
 participant. Similar visits to the control participants were
 framed as bed net visits. Participants remained on study
 from enrolment through the end of the child’s first year
 of life or until the end of surveillance in March 2016. On
 study completion, participants in the control and BioLite
 arms received a two-­burner LPG cookstove and two 14.5
 kg LPG cylinders.
 
<section> Efficacy endpoints
 The co-­primary endpoints of the trial were birth weight
 among liveborn infants born at 28 weeks or later
 gestational age; and physician-­assessed severe pneumonia
 in the first 12 months of life as defined in the WHO Inte-
 grated Management of Childhood Illnesses handbook
 (IMCI). 16 Secondary trial birth endpoints included birth
 length and head circumference, preterm birth (defined
 as ≥28 and <37 completed weeks gestation at delivery),
 low birth weight (defined as birth weight <2500 g) and
 small for gestational age (defined as <10th percentile
 for gestational age) 17 (see online supplemental mate-
 rial for detailed definitions). Secondary trial pneumonia
 endpoints included physician-­ diagnosed pneumonia
 and a composite outcome of fieldworker-­diagnosed and
 physician-­diagnosed pneumonia and severe pneumonia
 (again using IMCI definitions).
 Community-­ based fieldworkers measured birth
 anthropometrics within 24 hours of birth at the place of
 delivery (home or facility). Birth weight was measured to
 the nearest 0.01 kg (Tanita digital scale model BD-590,
 Tanita, Illinois, USA) after standardising the scale to a
 1 kg weight. Birth weight was considered missing if the
 fieldworkers were unable to measure birth weight within
 72 hours of birth. Birth length was measured with use of
 the Ayrton Infantometer Model M-200 (Ayrton, Minne-
 sota, USA) and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm and head
 circumference measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a
 paper tape (a ‘lasso’) from the Child Growth Foundation
 in London.
 Pneumonia surveillance involved active (weekly field-
 worker surveillance) and passive (self-­referral) methods.
 Community-­ based fieldworkers trained in the IMCI
 guidelines made weekly home visits to identify poten-
 tial pneumonia cases. The IMCI defines pneumonia as
 cough or difficulty breathing plus elevated respiratory
 rate (60 breaths/min in children aged 0–2 months (56
 days) or 50 breaths/min in children aged 2–12 months).
 Severe pneumonia was defined as pneumonia in a child
 less than 2 months of age or pneumonia plus the pres-
 ence of oxygen saturation of less than 90% as measured
 by pulse oximetry, chest wall indrawing, stridor or any
 general danger sign (including convulsions, vomiting or
 inability to drink or breast feed, lethargy or unconscious-
 ness). Any child with fieldworker-­diagnosed pneumonia,
 or who was otherwise unwell, was brought to a central
 medical clinic for physician evaluation. Community-­
 based fieldworkers also facilitated self-­referrals any time
 a parent felt that their child was ill. The study provided
 transportation and paid for incidental expenses related
 to all clinical visits. At the central clinic, study physicians
 trained in IMCI guidelines diagnosed pneumonia and
 severe pneumonia. The primary pneumonia outcome
 was physician-­diagnosed severe pneumonia, without the
 use of chest radiograph or ultrasound.
 Due to the visible nature of the intervention, field-
 workers were not blinded to study intervention arm.
 Physicians examined study children at a central clinic
 and were unaware of study intervention assignment.
 Study physicians immediately began treatment for pneu-
 monia or other diagnosed illness, including hospital 
<section> admission where appropriate. As with prior studies,
 children were not considered to have a new pneumonia
 episode if a repeat diagnosis occurred within 21 days of a
 prior pneumonia episode. If the initial assessment diag-
 nosed pneumonia and a repeat assessment within 21 days
 diagnosed severe pneumonia, the pneumonia episode
 was reclassified as severe. The secondary composite
 pneumonia outcome of fieldworker-­ diagnosed and
 physician-­ diagnosed pneumonia included physician-­
 assessed pneumonia cases as described above in addition
 to fieldworker-­assessed pneumonia cases where the child
 did not receive study physician assessment within 7 days
 of fieldworker assessment. In cases where a fieldworker
 diagnosis and subsequent physician diagnosis occur-
 ring within 7 days did not agree (eg, the fieldworker-­
 diagnosed pneumonia and the physician did not), the
 physician diagnosis was used.
 
<section> Air pollution exposure assessment
 We measured 72-­ hour personal exposures to carbon
 monoxide (CO) using Lascar EL-­USB-­CO sensors (Lascar
 Electronics, Erie, Pennsylvania, USA) and to particulate
 matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM ) using
 
<section> 2.5
 microPEM monitors (RTI, Research Triangle Park, North
 Carolina, USA). Antenatal CO monitoring occurred at
 enrolment prior to deployment of intervention cook-
 stove, 3 weeks after intervention cookstove deployment,
 and at two additional time points evenly spaced over the
 remaining antenatal period. Postnatal CO monitoring
 of both the child and the mother took place 1, 3 and
 9 months post partum. We measured PM in a subset
 
<section> 2.5
 of adult study participants during the second CO session
 (prenatally, 3 weeks post enrolment) and/or postnatally
 at child age 3 months. Budget limitations dictated the
 PM sample. Exposure assessment methods and results
 
<section> 2.5
 have been previously published.
 
<section> Additional trial assessments
 Maternal age, parity and medical history were assessed
 at enrolment through questionnaires. Maternal height
 and weight were measured on enrolment and used to
 determine maternal body mass index (BMI). Enrolment
 questionnaires determining household assets were used
 to construct an asset index as a proxy for wealth (see
 online supplemental material). Weekly fieldworker visits
 from enrolment through delivery captured the number
 of antenatal visits. Infant sex and date of delivery were
 recorded at birth. Fieldworkers and physicians recorded
 dates of pneumonia assessments which were used to
 determine month of pneumonia and age of child at
 the time of pneumonia diagnosis. At each prenatal and
 postnatal fieldworker visit, continued use of intervention
 cookstove was assessed via questionnaire.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 Power calculations for GRAPHS have been previously
 published. 12 The estimated sample size was 1415 pregnant
 women, with randomisation yielding 365 participants
 in the LPG arm (across 9 clusters), 525 participants in
 the improved biomass arm (across 13 clusters) and 525
 participants in the control arm (across 13 clusters). For
 the birth weight outcome, sample size calculations were
 based on estimated effect sizes (Cohen’s D) of 0.32 for
 the improved biomass arm and 0.40 for the LPG arm, 19
 15% attrition and a two-­sided type 1 error rate of 5%.
 We estimated that 1415 enrolled pregnancies would yield
 1225 participants reaching age 1. For pneumonia, we
 used an effect size derived from work in the Gambia,
 and, with the same attrition and type 1 error rate as
 above, computed power of 0.98 for the LPG arm, and
 0.89 for the improved biomass arm.
 Primary analyses were performed according to the
 intention-­to-­treat principle. First, we used linear regres-
 sion models to assess differences in birth weight by study
 arm. Cluster-­ robust SE estimates (at the village level)
 were employed to account for the cluster-­randomised
 nature of the intervention deployment. We additionally
 conducted secondary analyses that included adjustment
 for asset index; maternal BMI, age and parity; number
 of antenatal care visits dichotomised around the median
 (four visits); and infant sex. Additional continuous birth
 outcomes (head circumference, birth length and gesta-
 tional age at delivery) were analysed in the same manner
 as birth weight. Categorical birth outcomes (preterm
 birth, low birth weight, small-­ for-­ gestational-­ age and
 neonatal death occurring within 7 days of birth) were
 analysed using modified Poisson regressions with robust
 SE using the ‘sandwich’ estimator.
 Any infant born alive and with at least one field-
 worker pneumonia surveillance visit was included in
 the pneumonia analyses. Primary pneumonia anal-
 yses were performed according to the intention-­ to-­
 treat principle. We employed generalised estimating
 equation (GEE) logistic regression models with
 exchangeable correlation structure and cluster-­robust
 SE estimates to assess the difference in incidence of
 physician-­assessed severe pneumonia in the first year
 of life per child-­days. GEE was used to account for
 both multiple episodes within a child and the village-­
 level intervention deployment. 22 Secondary analyses
 adjusted for an asset index, month of delivery, month
 of pneumonia event, child sex and child age. These
 same models were used to examine the effect of cook-
 stove intervention on physician-­ assessed pneumonia
 and composite outcomes of fieldworker-­assessed and
 physician-­assessed pneumonia and severe pneumonia.
 We additionally conducted survival analyses using Cox
 proportional-­hazard models for the time to the first
 incident of physician-­ diagnosed severe pneumonia,
 pneumonia or composite pneumonia outcomes,
 considered separately, to examine group differences
 in the risk, with and without adjustment of child sex,
 month of delivery and an asset index. HRs for group
 comparisons were derived from estimated model
 parameters, and their CIs were based on robust sand-
 wich estimate of variance of parameter estimates to

 tion among the children. Analyses were carried out in

 improved biomass cookstove intervention and 526 were
 assigned control (figure 1). Fewer clusters were assigned
 intentionally to the LPG arm because we assumed that
 it would result in a greater reduction in pollution expo-
 sure, and would therefore require a smaller sample to
 detect an effect. The baseline characteristics are shown
 in table 1. The study groups demonstrated balance in key
 characteristics such as maternal BMI, health history and
 baseline exposures to CO (a key component of HAP).
 Across arms, we note differences in maternal age, gesta-
 tional age at enrolment, parity, maternal education and
 marital status. Our overarching conclusion from table
 is that our randomisation achieved reasonable balance,
 but that adjusted analyses are warranted to account for
 small differences in baseline characteristics.
 Across the study period, participants reported using
 their intervention stoves to cook their main meal the
 previous day during approximately 87% of weekly visits
 to households in the LPG study arm (~25 000 visits) and
 69% of visits to households in the improved biomass
 study arm (~34 000 visits) (online supplemental figure
 2). We did not observe control households switching to
 cleaner cookstoves or fuels during the study period.
 The study cohort resulted in 340 (94.2% of enrolled
 women) live births 28 weeks or later gestational age in
 the LPG arm, 491 (93.2%) in the improved biomass cook-
 stove arm and 475 (90.3%) in the control arm, including
 four sets of twins identified at delivery (one in LPG, one
 in improved biomass and two in control). As these twin
 pregnancies were identified only after delivery, the moth-
 er–twin triads were followed through the first year of life
 and data included in all analyses. Average gestational age
 at delivery was: 39‍ ± ‍1.7 weeks in the LPG arm, 39.3‍ ± ‍1.5
 weeks in the improved biomass arm and 39.2‍ ± ‍1.8 in the
 control arm. There were 245 (51%), 233 (45%) and 174
 (51%) female newborns in the LPG, improved biomass
 and control arms, respectively.
 Birth weight was measured for 331 (97.4% of live
 births), 474 (96.5%) and 462 (97.2%) newborns in the
 LPG, improved biomass and control arms, respectively.
 The mean birth weights by study arm were: 2867‍ ± ‍470 g
 for LPG, 2904‍ ± ‍458 g for improved biomass cookstove 
<section> arm and 2894‍ ± ‍ 54 for controls. There was no differ-
 ence in birth weight between study arms. The unadjusted
 (N=1267) and adjusted (N=1258) difference in mean
 birth weight for LPG newborns was −27 g (95% CI −111
 to 58, p=0.54) and −15 g (95% CI −96 to 66, p=0.71)
 as compared with control newborns, respectively. The
 unadjusted and adjusted difference in birth weight for
 the improved biomass cookstove arm newborns was 10 g
 (95% CI −63 to 84, p=0.78) and −8 g (95% CI −81 to 64,
 p=0.82) as compared with control newborns, respectively
 (table 2).
 Analysis of secondary birth outcomes did not demon-
 strate differences in head circumference or birth length
 between study arms. There were 8 (2%), 11 (2%) and 10
 (1%) fetal losses (loss at <28 weeks gestational age) and
 6 (2%), 13 (2%) and 17 (3%) stillbirths (lost or not born
 alive ≥28 weeks gestational age) in the LPG, improved
 biomass and control arms, respectively. Unadjusted
 (N=1303) analyses suggested there were fewer preterm
 births in the improved biomass cookstove arm compared
 with control (12 (2%) vs 24 (5%) preterm births, or a risk
 ratio of 0.48 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.93, p=0.03)); the adjusted
 (N=1294) difference was 0.50 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.95,
 p=0.03). No difference in preterm birth was detected
 between LPG and control arms. There was no difference
 in low birth weight, small for gestational age or neonatal
 deaths between study arms.
 Of the 1306 live births at 28 weeks gestation or after,
 40 (3.4%) children died in the first year of life, or 33.6
 deaths per 1000 live births. Of these, 26 occurred in the
 first 28 days of life (22.9 neonatal vs 10.7 post-­neonatal
 deaths per 1000 live births).
 For all 1306 live-­ born children, weekly fieldworker
 visits over the first year of life provided an opportunity
 for 67 912 child-­weeks of fieldworker follow-­up. Pneu-
 monia follow-­up lasted through 22 March 2016, when the
 youngest GRAPHS child aged out of the study. In total,
 678 (93.3%, accounting for 1811 child-­weeks lost due to
 under-1 mortalities) child-­weeks of fieldworker follow-­up
 (16 858, 22 786 and 22 034 in LPG, improved biomass
 and control arms, respectively) resulted in identification
 of 408 physician-­diagnosed pneumonia cases (115,
 and 138 cases in LPG, improved biomass and control
 arms, respectively) and 127 physician-­diagnosed severe
 pneumonia cases (32, 52 and 43 in the LPG, improved
 biomass and control arms, respectively). There was no
 significant difference in physician-­assessed severe pneu-
 monia between study arms. The unadjusted and adjusted
 rate ratios for severe pneumonia in children in the LPG
 arm was 0.98 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.70; p=0.95) and 0.98
 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.65; p=0.93) as compared with children
 in the control arm, respectively. The unadjusted and
 adjusted rate ratios for severe pneumonia in children in
 the improved biomass arm was 1.21 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.90;
 p=0.39) and 1.19 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.91; p=0.48) in the
 LPG arm, as compared with children in the control arm,
 respectively (table 3).
 
<section> Analysis of secondary pneumonia outcomes did not
 demonstrate differences in physician-­ assessed pneu-
 monia or composite fieldworker-­assessed and physician-­
 assessed pneumonia or severe pneumonia between study
 arms. Unadjusted and adjusted survival analyses for
 incidence of child pneumonia using Cox proportional-­
 hazard regressions did not demonstrate differences in
 physician-­assessed or physician-­assessed and fieldworker-­
 assessed pneumonia and severe pneumonia between
 groups (figure 2, (online supplemental table 2).
 Personal CO exposure assessments were performed
 for 515 women in the control arm, 520 in the improved
 biomass stove arm and 354 in the LPG arm. Prior to
 intervention, median personal CO exposures were 1.17
 parts per million (ppm; IQR, 0.62–2.09), 1.17 ppm (IQR,
 0.64–1.94) and 1.30 ppm (IQR, 0.70–2.13), respectively,
 for women in the control, improved biomass stove and
 LPG arms (table 1). Following intervention, personal
 CO exposure was lower in the LPG arm (median CO,
 0.52 ppm; IQR, 0.20–1.16) and in the improved biomass
 stove arm (median CO, 0.74 ppm; IQR, 0.33–1.47) as
 compared with in the control arm (median CO, 0.82
 ppm; IQR, 0.37–1.65).
 Valid post-­intervention personal prenatal or postnatal
 PM exposure assessments were performed in 202,
 2.5
 and 356 women in LPG, improved biomass and control
 arms, respectively. Personal PM exposures in the LPG
 
<section> 2.5
 arm (median PM , 45 µg/m³; IQR, 32–65) were lower
 
<section> 2.5
 than those in the control arm (median PM , 67 µg/
 
<section> 2.5
 m³; IQR, 46–97). There was no difference in personal
 PM exposures between improved biomass cookstove
 
<section> 2.5
 (median PM , 67 µg/m³; IQR, 44–94) and control arms

 No harms or adverse events were observed as a result of
 trial procedures.
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> We carried out a cluster-­ randomised controlled trial
 assessing the benefits of clean cooking interventions
 initiated during pregnancy and continued for the first
 year of the infant’s life. In intention-­ to-­ treat analyses,
 we found no evidence that either improved biomass or
 LPG cookstoves led to improvements in birth weight or
 to reductions in severe pneumonia risk. These null find-
 ings extended to secondary obstetrical and pneumonia
 outcomes, including anthropometrics at birth, preterm
 birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age and alter-
 native pneumonia case definitions (with the exception of
 a reduction in the risk of preterm birth in the improved
 biomass arm, which we attribute to chance).
 Worldwide, ALRI is a leading cause of death in chil-
 dren under 5 years of age and HAP pollution exposure
 is the second leading risk factor. Despite the epidemio-
 logical evidence supporting an exposure-­response associ-
 ation, evidence for the efficacy of a cooking intervention
 to reduce ALRI risk is mixed. Two trials—RESPIRE in

<section> evidence of reduced ALRI risk from improved biomass
 interventions. RESPIRE deployed a chimney stove inter-
 vention that resulted in a 50% reduction from 2.2 to 1.1
 ppm CO exposure. Intention-­to-­treat analyses found a 22%
 (rate ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.06, p=0.10) and a
 33% (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.98, p=0.04) reduction in
 physician-­diagnosed pneumonia and severe pneumonia,
 respectively. Kirby et al studied a natural draft rocket-­style
 stove versus no intervention in Rwanda and observed a
 25% reduction in reported child ALRI (RR 0.75, 95%
 CI 0.60 to 0.93, p=0.01) without a measured reduction
 in cook or child-­level PM exposure. Conversely, the
 CAPS trial in Malawi 5 and 2.5 a smaller trial in Peru, 6 both
 evaluating improved biomass stove interventions, found
 no benefit on child ALRI. Direct comparison with these
 prior studies is hampered by differences in baseline air
 pollution exposures, inclusion criteria and intervention
 cookstoves.
 Similar to ALRI, data has been mixed from interven-
 tional studies about whether improved cook stoves can
 impact birth outcomes. Investigators from RESPIRE
 reported that birth weight was 89 g heavier among those
 using a chimney stove in the trial; however, the CI was
 wide and crossed 0 (95% CI −27 g to 204 g). 23 Further-
 more, as recruitment into RESPIRE included households
 with either a pregnant woman or infant <4 months, only
 266 of the 534 households recruited included a pregnant
 woman and the benefits of randomisation in balancing
 potential drivers of birth weight differences might have
 been lost. Researchers in rural Nepal were unable to
 demonstrate a change in birth weight or other pregnancy
 outcomes in two sequentially conducted randomised
 trials evaluating first an improved and vented biomass
 stove and second LPG stoves. 7 In contrast, benefits were
 reported from a trial conducted in Ibadan, Nigeria, that
 individually randomised 324 pregnant women to use
 of an ethanol stove versus continued use of traditional
 fuels (kerosene and firewood). 24 The 88 g improve-
 ment in birth weight was not significantly different
 from the control group (95% CI −18 to 194) in unad-
 justed intention-­to-­treat analyses. The authors report a
 significant improvement in birth weight from adjusted
 models (197 grams, 95% CI 25 to 368) accounting for
 some baseline differences that were imbalanced despite
 randomisation. Notably, the ethanol stove intervention
 did not significantly impact personal exposure to PM as
 
<section> 2.5
 compared with control. The GRAPHS LPG intervention,
 by contrast, reduced exposure to CO and PM , yet did not
 
<section> 2.5
 perform as hypothesised with regards to improvements in
 birth weight or other pregnancy outcomes. While we did
 observe a reduction in preterm birth in mothers using
 the biomass stove, we are unable to explain this isolated
 benefit and cannot exclude the possibility that the signif-
 icant result was due to chance, particularly given the low
 preterm birth rate observed in our population.
 The null trial result did not appear to be driven by poor
 uptake of the intervention. Households randomised to
 the LPG arm received unlimited LPG fuel for the study

 duration. For both intervention arms, weekly fieldworker
 check-­ins facilitated stove repairs and encouraged use.
 Fieldworkers assessed use of the intervention stoves
 every week and found that on average 87% and 69% of
 households in the LPG arm and improved biomass stove
 arm, respectively, reported using the intervention stove.
 These results may be subject to recall bias and objective
 data, such as from stove use monitoring devices, was not
 obtained. However, these data do suggest that on average
 the uptake of stove intervention was robust.

<section> The central question, therefore, raised by the study
 results is why the intervention failed to improve health.
 In a laboratory setting, the GRAPHS LPG intervention
 stove reduces PM and CO emissions to levels meeting
 WHO emission rate 2.5 targets, 25 yet our intervention did
 not improve birth weight or reduce pneumonia risk.
 We hypothesise that our cookstove interventions, as
 deployed in the field, failed to reduce exposures enough
 to improve health outcomes. The WHO Interim-1 Target
 for annual average PM exposure is 35 µg/m³, 26 but
 
<section> 2.5
 intervention households in our study exceeded this
 target despite reported consistent use.
 Several factors may explain this residual exposure
 in the LPG arm, and potentially also in the improved
 biomass arm—though for the improved biomass arm we
 cannot rule out the possibility that the stove itself was
 an important source of emissions. First, our household-­
 level intervention left study participants exposed to emis-
 sions from neighbours’ cooking, as has been suggested
 in previous field assessments of clean fuel stoves. 27 Our
 study communities had high housing density (control
 communities mean (SD) persons within 50 m: 48.4
 (29.6); BioLite communities mean (SD): 48.6 (31.9);
 
<section> LPG communities mean (SD): 53.9 (35)) and, given
 the inclusion criteria requiring a pregnant participant,
 few households per community were enrolled. Second,
 LPG households may have continued to use their tradi-
 tional biomass cookstoves. As described above, our
 weekly survey data suggests that this was rare in the LPG
 arm (13% of meals), but we lack objective sensor-­based
 measurements to rule out the possibility of persistent
 stove stacking. Third, emissions from other community
 or regional combustion sources, such as trash burning or
 agricultural burning, may have kept exposures high, but
 again our exposure assessment approach did not allow us
 to differentiate by source.
 We also note that HAP exposure levels—both pre-­
 intervention and post-­ intervention—are relatively low
 in our cohort, compared with the other trials discussed
 above. When we designed the GRAPHS study we viewed
 this exposure environment as a strength. We hypothe-
 sised that these levels implied that exposure reductions
 would occur on the steep part of the exposure response
 curve for pneumonia, which was estimated by Burnett
 et al to drop sharply below at low levels of PM 2.5 expo-
 sure, but to be relatively flat at high levels. 28 We cannot
 rule out the possibility that the ALRI shape of the expo-
 sure response curve does not follow this pattern, or that
 factors specific to central Ghana generate a different
 shape.
 Our study did not enrol participants until the second
 trimester of pregnancy. Interventions to improve newborn
 and infant health may have greater effect if initiated
 earlier in pregnancy. If so, this would have significant
 implications for the design of clean household energy
 policies in LMIC settings. 
<section> Observed infant, neonatal and post-­neonatal mortality
 rates were only about half what has been reported for
 the broader Ghanaian population, suggesting that the
 totality of our intervention, with frequent interactions
 between participants and our study team and improved
 access to healthcare, may have improved infant health
 across study arms. If this was the case, it is possible that
 in the context of improved overall health the added
 benefit of a cleaner burning stove was not detectable.
 The 2011 Ghana Multiple Cluster Indicator Survey esti-
 mated infant mortality at 53 deaths per 1000 live births;
 neonatal (first month of life) and post-­neonatal (age
 month—first birthday) mortality rates were estimated
 at 32 and 21 deaths per 1000 live births. 29 In the Brong
 Ahafo region where Kintampo is located, these numbers
 are even higher (66, 44 and 21 infant, neonatal and post-­
 neonatal, respectively, deaths per 1000 live births). In our
 cohort, weekly fieldworker follow-­ up allowed tracking
 of mortality over infancy. We observed lower infant
 mortality, evident in both the neonatal and post-­neonatal
 periods (33.6, 22.9 and 10.7 infant, neonatal and post-­
 neonatal deaths per 1000 live births). The provision of
 insecticide-­treated bed nets and health insurance to all
 mother–infant dyads and easy access to healthcare over
 the study period, including physician assessment and
 treatment, appears to have had a substantial effect on
 maternal and infant health. This overall effect may have
 reduced our ability to detect a meaningful impact of HAP
 interventions on health.
 Our study has several strengths. GRAPHS was among
 the first trials to assess LPG as an alternative to improved
 biomass cookstoves, and to assess LPG alongside lower-­
 cost improved biomass interventions. As with RESPIRE,
 our study relied on active case finding and physician-­
 assessed diagnosis for ALRI; other studies relied on
 community-­assessed ALRI. We employed an active pneu-
 monia surveillance programme wherein study children
 were assessed every week. This approach likely identi-
 fied pneumonia cases early in their clinical course and
 potentially reduced the number of severe pneumonia
 cases we would have seen had this network not been in
 place. We acknowledge that active case finding could
 therefore be construed as a weakness. Active case finding
 was deemed ethical by our team as it is well-­described
 that infectious mortality is related to time to treatment.
 Indeed, the infant mortality rate in our cohort was nearly
 half of country and regional trends, suggesting that this
 approach saved lives. Other important strengths of the
 study include ultrasound-­assessed gestational age, digital
 measurement of birth weight even for in-­home deliveries,
 extensive personal exposure monitoring and physician
 assessment of suspected pneumonia cases.
 We also acknowledge limitations. Given the fieldworkers
 visited the households weekly and that our intervention
 was clustered by community, we were unable to blind
 fieldworkers to study arm. However, physician assess-
 ments were performed at a central clinic and physicians
 were unaware of study assignment. Participants reported
 stove use weekly, but these data may have inherent bias.
 Budget limitations prevented us from sensor-­based stove
 use assessments, which would have addressed this poten-
 tial bias. Our ALRI diagnosis would have been strength-
 ened by objective diagnostic tests such as lung ultrasound
 or chest X-­rays, however these were not readily available
 at our study site.
 In conclusion, we found no evidence that a strategy of
 providing even the cleanest fuels to individual pregnant
 women in the context of antenatal care improved birth
 weight or reduced infant severe pneumonia. Air pollu-
 tion levels in both intervention arms remained high,
 suggesting that meaningful health improvements from
 HAP interventions may require deployment of clean
 energy across entire communities.
