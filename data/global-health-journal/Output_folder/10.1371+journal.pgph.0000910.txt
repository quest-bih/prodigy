<section> Abstract
 
<section> Adolescent girls in Burkina Faso face unintended pregnancy risk due to a lack of contracep-
 tive use. The (re)solve project was designed to address contraceptive misperceptions and
 increase girls’ perceptions of their pregnancy risk, primarily through a participatory game
 and a health passport aimed at easing health facility access. The intervention components
 were implemented for girls in private and public school in grades 4ème and 3ème (grades
 and 10) in Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. We conducted an impact eval-
 uation using a mixed-methods cluster randomized control trial design to evaluate (re)solve’s
 impact on girls’ intentions to use contraception, among other outcomes. Thirty-two schools
 were randomly allocated intervention or control. The evaluation included quantitative longi-
 tudinal surveys at baseline (N = 2,372) and endline (N = 2,072), qualitative in-depth inter-
 views with girls in the intervention group at baseline (N = 41) and endline (N = 48) and with
 implementation staff (N = 35) and experts (N = 14) at endline. We used generalized estimat-
 ing equations (GEE) analysis for the main analysis. Girls receiving the intervention had
 more positive attitudes related to contraception at endline compared to girls at control
 schools. (re)solve had a positive effect on girls’ intention to use contraception (aOR = 1.59,
 95% CI 0.97–2.61), though this did not reach statistical significance. The impact was partic-
 ularly large among girls who had never had sex, girls who attended public schools, and girls
 in 3ème. Qualitative findings suggest the intervention was well received and positively
 shifted attitudes and facility-seeking behaviors for many girls, but that myths and miscon-
 ceptions related to contraceptive use persist in this mostly young, sexually naïve population.
 That the (re)solve intervention appears to have shifted adolescent girls’ attitudes toward
 using contraception, coupled with positive trends in intention to use contraception, indicates

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Globally, among adolescent girls aged 15 to 19, 52% have an unmet need for contraception [1].
 In Burkina Faso adolescent girls experience high rates of unintended pregnancy, at roughly
 births per 1,000 girls aged 15 to 19 [2]. Contraceptive use among young women in Burkina
 Faso is extremely low, with 83% of women aged 15 to 24 who have had sex having never used
 modern contraceptive method. The median age at first contraceptive use for urban Burkinabé
 women ages 25–49 is 22, four years after having sex for the first time (median age 18.1) and
 over a year after getting married (median age 20.9) [3]. Almost a quarter of nonusers of contra-
 ceptives aged 15 to 49 who wanted to delay their next birth by two or more years said they
 were not using contraceptives because they were not married, and 47.9% did not believe them-
 selves to be at risk of pregnancy or in need of contraceptives [4].
 Despite decades of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) programming in Sub-Saharan
 Africa (SSA), there is a dearth of rigorous evidence on the impact of school-based program-
 ming. Most of the existing literature has focused on HIV/AIDS programming measuring out-
 comes such as condom use. Several literature and systematic reviews on school-based
 interventions for SRH in SSA report positive changes in attitudes but weak and inconsistent
 findings on behavior change [5–9]. For example, in the most recent review, two studies showed
 significant decline in unintended pregnancies and four showed improvements in HIV/AIDS-
 related knowledge, condom use, and attitudes toward testing; however, data on sexual trans-
 mitted infection outcomes and sexual debut were incomplete, unreliable or did not show sta-
 tistically significant results [9]. One study from Ghana found that the addition of school-based
 and outreach activities to community mobilization and provider training efforts increased ser-
 vice usage for adolescents, including STI, perinatal and antenatal services [10]. There are few
 any studies assessing school-based SRH activities in West Africa, and very few in SSA focused
 explicitly on adolescent pregnancy rather than HIV/AIDS.
 The (re)solve project (described in detail below) was designed to address reasons for non-
 use of modern contraceptives among unmarried, in-school adolescent girls in 4ème and 3ème
 (grades 9 and 10 respectively) in Burkina Faso. The primary objective of the intervention,
 designed through (re)solve’s multi-phased process, was to demystify and normalize contracep-
 tion as a valid option of pregnancy prevention for girls. Other objectives of the project
 included providing accurate information about contraception, menstruation, puberty and sex-
 ual activity and encouraging girls to follow up with questions at a health facility, with the ulti-
 mate goal of method uptake and pregnancies averted. The (re)solve intervention was designed
 to be “light touch” and a scalable behavioral change program that could shift SRH attitudes
 among adolescent girls in a low-resource setting.
 Data generated through the (re)solve behavioral diagnosis process (Through a segmenta-
 tion analysis and behavioral diagnosis process, the team identified behavioral segments and
 prioritized events, situations or cognitive patterns of thinking (i.e. “behavioral bottlenecks”)
 that block girls from taking actions that would otherwise meet their needs.) suggested that the
 main reasons explaining girls’ nonuse of contraception in Burkina Faso primarily included 
<section> that girls do not explicitly think about all the consequences of sex; perceive they are at low risk
 of getting pregnant; do not think contraception is intended for girls like them; fear that others
 will find out they are using contraception; and have more appealing options to avoid preg-
 nancy than contraception [11]. Studies from sub-Saharan Africa confirm these factors impede
 access to and demand for contraception among young people [12, 13]. These reasons were the-
 orized to be driven by features like attitudes, beliefs and norms that interfere with the deci-
 sion-making process along the pathway from intention formation (e.g. the decision to become
 pregnant or not, or to use a method) to follow-through (e.g. at a clinic, the decision to get a
 method). Knowing that actual contraception use would be unlikely achievable during the six
 months implementation timeframe, the project team focused instead on influencing attitudes
 related to pregnancy risk and contraception, and intention to use contraception, which is com-
 monly used in the field and is often predictive of future use [14–17].
 This paper presents data from the mixed-method evaluation of a novel school-based adoles-
 cent SRH intervention in Burkina Faso. Specifically, we assessed whether the (re)solve package
 of solutions had an impact on girls’ intention to use contraception in the near future, among
 other attitudinal outcomes such feelings and perceptions about modern contraceptives.
 
<section> The (re)solve intervention
 
<section> The (re)solve intervention was informed by several processes that generated data and insights
 on young women’s barriers to contraceptive use and nonuse in Burkina Faso. Through behav-
 ioral landscape analysis and behavioral diagnosis, the project team identified behavioral seg-
 ments (i.e., subgroups that share characteristics like needs or demographic profiles) through
 segmentation analysis and prioritized behavioral bottlenecks (i.e., aspects that prevent individ-
 uals from making decisions or taking actions). The combined insights from segmentation
 analysis and behavioral diagnosis into individual, social, and structural barriers served as pri-
 mary inputs into the design of the intervention. The insights and the intervention components
 both informed the identification of the specific subpopulation of unmarried schoolgirls in
 4ème and 3ème among whom the interventions were user tested [11]. The solutions were also
 tested with health providers and program implementers.
 This collective feedback informed the final content, design, and implementation of the
 intervention, which comprised the following components [11]:
 
<section> • 
<section> School-based, participatory board game (La Chance): The game was played in a classroom
 by three teams of two schoolgirls each from 4ème and 3ème (grades 9 and 10 respectively),
 and was facilitated by a trained community health worker. Game play typically lasted about
 an hour and was held during lunch break or free periods. Through the board game, girls
 explored a series of real-life relationship scenarios, increased their pregnancy risk percep-
 tion, and confronted SRH myths and misconceptions. To advance play, students engaged
 strategic decision making, answered trivia questions, and responded to discussion prompts.
 After each game, the facilitator led a discussion on what the girls learned and encouraged the
 girls to talk to a health care provider.
 
<section> • 
<section> Health Facility Passport: After the game, the facilitators gave girls passports that listed health
 facilities where providers were familiar with the (re)solve intervention. Arriving at the facilities
 with a health passport signaled girls’ interest in SRH information, counseling, or services,
 including contraception, to facility staff. Participating health care professionals had been ori-
 ented to the intervention and its rationale and had received training on how to provide youth-
 friendly services. Health workers could therefore see the passports and recognize the services
 the girls were interested in and quickly provide them with discreet SRH counseling or services. 
<section> • 
<section> Posters and Name Tags: Posters that matched the design of the board game were displayed
 in participating schools and health facilities advertising puberty-related, non-contraceptive
 counseling and services for girls (such as those related to menstruation). In schools, these
 posters encouraged girls to access services, and while waiting at the health facility, the posters
 normalized their presence and gave them reasons to be there should a family member or
 anyone else see them or ask about the purpose of their visit. Providers and staff trained in
 youth-friendly services also wore matching name tags to help them be easily identifiable to
 girls visiting the facilities.
 
<section> The program team implemented the (re)solve intervention in 16 randomly selected second-
 ary schools—eight each in Bobo-Dioulasso (Bobo) and Ouagadougou (Ouaga) –in 4ème and
 3ème. In each location, they trained 16 community-based facilitators to lead the board games
 and distribute the passports and identified 18 health facilities (nine each in Bobo and Ouaga)
 to participate. A total of 3,120 girls in grades 3ème and 4ème played La Chance between
 December 2019 and March 2020. Facilitators distributed 11,908 passports to girls in this
 timeframe.
 
<section> Materials and methods
 
<section> Evaluation design and hypotheses
 
<section> We conducted an impact evaluation using a mixed-methods cluster randomized control trial
 design to evaluate whether the (re)solve package of solutions changed girls’ intentions to use
 contraception, among other attitudinal outcomes. The trial took place among girls primarily
 aged 14 to 18 years in 4éme and 3éme grade in 32 public and private secondary schools in
 Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso. The impact evaluation component con-
 sisted of quantitative longitudinal surveys at baseline, at two months (midline, in intervention
 schools only) and seven months (endline) post intervention initiation. Our primary outcome
 of interest was intention to use contraception within the next three months. Other outcomes
 of interest included attitudes related to SRH, such as the belief that contraception causes infer-
 tility. Attitudes are important individual markers of underlying belief systems and are often
 correlated with intention and behavior, including attitudes about family planning with con-
 traceptive use [18, 19]. The data were analyzed according to the intention to treat principle.
 Our primary hypothesis was that girls in 4ème and 3ème who were exposed to the board
 game and given a health passport to facilitate follow-up at health facility would be more likely
 to report positive attitudes toward and accurate knowledge about sex and contraception and
 form an intention to use contraception.
 We also conducted qualitative in-depth interviews (IDIs) with adolescent girls at baseline
 and endline in the intervention schools only. At endline, we also held IDIs with implementa-
 tion staff and conducted key-informant interviews (KIIs) with experts and authorities in sexual
 and reproduction health who were not part of the (re)solve project. Through IDIs and KIIs,
 sought to contextualize our quantitative findings with a deeper understanding of girls’ behav-
 iors and attitudes toward sex and contraception, as well as their perceptions of the attitudes
 held by peers, adult family members and others in the community.
 
<section> Selection of (re)solve health facilities, schools, and participants
 
<section> We used a multi-stage cluster design with schools as clusters. In the first stage, the team purpo-
 sively selected nine health facilities in Ouaga and 10 in Bobo from a list of eligible facilities.
 The purposive sampling was used to ensure that we had diversity of health facilities based on
 facility type and geographical spread, and to make sure that these facilities all offered youth 
<section> friendly services. Next, the team randomly selected schools in the catchment areas of these
 health facilities. To reach a sample size of 2,400 girls, we selected 32 schools total (16 in each
 city). We randomly assigned the (re)solve intervention to half of the schools, and the other half
 were control schools, such that there were eight intervention schools in each city. The inter-
 vention was randomly assigned to a higher proportion of private schools, as fewer public
 schools in Bobo met the criteria. Therefore, we used four public schools and twelve private
 schools each in Ouaga and Bobo. Of these, half were randomly assigned the intervention and
 half, the control. We used a random number generator in Excel to assign the first set of schools
 on each list to intervention and those that followed to control.
 At intervention schools, we invited all girls that were interested in participating in the (re)
 solve intervention to be part of the study. Once the full list of interested girls was prepared, the
 team randomly sorted the list and then invited the first set of girls on the list to participate in
 the quantitative survey, followed by the qualitative study. At control schools, all girls in rele-
 vant grades interested in participating in the research were put on a list and that list was ran-
 domly sorted and the girls whose names were at the top of the list were invited to participate.
 
<section> Sample size and power analysis
 
<section> The research team estimated a sample size of 2,497 girls for the baseline and endline longitudi-
 nal impact evaluation assuming (a) 50% of the baseline population would have an intention
 use contraception (the most conservative estimate, but also the prevalence of intention to use
 contraception from a previous project survey among a similar group of adolescent girls in Bur-
 kina Faso), (b) a minimal detectable change between baseline and endline of 10%, (c) a design
 effect of 2.0, (d) a 53% non-response rate on the outcome of interest (based on previous project
 data, assuming girls who are not sexually active would have different intentions to use contra-
 ception), (e) 10% attrition of participants between baseline and endline, and (f) a two-arm
 design with alpha 0.05 and 80% power. We rounded slightly down to 2,400 to ensure a mini-
 mum number of 75 girls involved from each school could be reached given the smallest school
 in (res)solve had an estimated 75 girls in relevant grades.
 
<section> Data collection procedures
 
<section> The research team collected baseline data between November 2019 and January 2020, after a
 seven-day training in Ouagadougou for the research partners. After a refresher training, the
 research team collected midline data in person in January and February 2020. The research
 team collected endline data in July 2020. Though data collection was originally scheduled for
 March 2020, it was delayed due to COVID-19 and conducted entirely by phone. At baseline
 surveys with girls were conducted in private locations in or around their homes or schools. At
 endline, all data collection activities took place over the phone due to COVID-19. Due to the
 unusual nature of phone-based interviews at endline, we provided additional training and
 spent additional time piloting the tools before implementing the final round of data collection.
 A team of mixed-gendered consultants from REM Africa who were experienced in social
 research and evaluation conducted the interviews. Assessments of the first tranche of data did
 not show any differences in key outcomes and sensitive questions by gender of the interviewer.
 The team received a multi-day ethical and project training from ICRW prior to each round
 data collection. The team carried out a pilot of all tools and questions based on prepared scripts
 prior to data collection. When interviewed, participants were requested to remain in a private
 location where they could not be overheard by anyone else, and to alert the interviewer if
 someone else entered the room. Interviews lasted approximately 60–90 minutes. 
<section> Qualitative interviews were audio recorded, and interviewers also took notes during the
 interviews. All endline interviews were conducted over the phone due to COVID-19.
 
<section> Consent and assent procedures
 
<section> Under the guidance of CEIRSS, we set the age of majority at 20 years. Therefore, all partici-
 pants aged 20 and older signed a consent form; for girls younger than 20, we obtained parental
 consent and then girls’ assent for participation. During the assent and consent processes, par-
 ticipants and, when relevant, their parents were made aware that the researcher was part of the
 REM Africa team, working with ICRW, and conducting a study related to (re)solve.
 
<section> Ethics statement
 
<section> The ICRW Institutional Review Board, based in Washington, DC, reviewed and approved all
 initial and modified versions of this study, as did the Comite D’Ethique Institutionnel Pour la
 Recherche en Sciences de la Sante (CEIRSS) in Burkina Faso. All members of the research team
 completed certifications in ethical training.
 
<section> Variables for quantitative analysis
 
<section> Our primary outcome (percent of girls with an intention to use contraception in the next three
 months) was originally measured using a four-point Likert scale (1 = Yes, definitely; 2 = Yes,
 probably; 3 = No, probably not; and 4 = No, definitely not). We collapsed this to a binary vari-
 able (No/Yes) and included the 12 girls at endline who responded that they preferred not to
 answer in the “No” category. We chose intention to use contraception in the next three
 months as our main outcome of interest because we predicted that it was achievable to influ-
 ence in the timeframe available, unlike other relevant behaviors such as contraceptive use.
 Other key variables focused on SRH attitudes, which were focused on individual beliefs
 about what is true or untrue. Specifically, we measured the percent of girls who strongly agree
 or agreed that (a) contraception causes infertility (“Modern contraception can cause infertil-
 ity”), (b) contraception is the best option (“If I am having sex and want to avoid pregnancy
 modern contraception is best option”), (c) they have the confidence to both get and use con-
 traception (“I feel confident in my ability to get a contraceptive method, if I wanted to avoid
 pregnancy” and “I feel confident in my ability to use a contraceptive method, if I wanted to
 avoid pregnancy”), and(d) health care workers do not like to give contraceptive advice to
 unmarried girls (“Health care workers do not like to give advice to young unmarried girls
 about family planning”). We collapsed these variables originally using a four-point Likert scale
 (1 = Strongly agree; 2 = Agree; 3 = Disagree; and 4 = Strongly disagree) into a binary variable
 (0 = Disagree and 1 = Agree).
 Other variables of interest included city, school type (private or public), grade (4eme or 3eme),
 and age. We used principal component analysis to generate a household wealth index using
 variables that were collected in the baseline survey among all girls. These included access to elec-
 tricity, a TV, pay for service TV, personal computer, bicycle, a car or van, a bank account, live-
 stock, internet at home and a motorcycle or scooter. For our analyses, we standardized the index
 (using the mean and standard deviation of the raw values) and collapsed into quintiles, with the
 first and fifth quintiles reflecting least and most wealthy households, respectively.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> For the main analysis, we used data at endline from 2,072 girls. We assessed baseline character-
 istics by arm as well as a comparison between the girls that were available at endline for the 
<section> main analysis and those girls that dropped out of the study. We present data related to expo-
 sure to the intervention, including information about girls’ experiences at the health facilities.
 We also show trends between baseline and endline in the community-level geometric means
 for primary and other variables, as well as the percentage of girls who reported ever going to
 health facility for SRH information or services among the intervention-school girls.
 For the main analyses, we examined the association between key sociodemographic and
 attitudinal predictors and the primary outcome within the regression framework described
 above. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis to examine the impact of the
 intervention on our primary outcome of interest. We developed four models, all of them
 adjusted for baseline values of the outcome. In the first model (unadjusted model) we report
 the crude estimate of the impact of the intervention on our outcome of interest. For the
 adjusted analyses, we first fit models adjusted for age (adjusted Model 1). We then additionally
 adjusted for predictors that were found to have a statistically significant association with our
 primary outcome (e.g. COVID-19’s effect on mobility, adjusted Model 2). In the final model
 we additionally adjusted for predictors that were selected a priori based on theory and previous
 research (e.g. city, grade, and wealth quintile, adjusted Model 3). We fit all models with
 exchangeable correlation matrix (to allow for correlations between participants within the
 same cluster) and robust standard errors, as recommended for cluster randomized trials with
 more than 15 clusters per arm [20].
 In sensitivity analyses, we ran our models stratified by several variables for which we
 thought the impact might vary by, including reporting ever having had sex, type of school (i.e.
 private or public), grade and whether girls in the intervention schools visited a health facility.
 We also examined the impact of the intervention restricted to girls in the intervention schools
 who reported or did not report seeking more information and/or contraceptive services at a
 health facility. Finally, we looked at the impact of the intervention for girls who intended to
 a facility but did not follow through because of reasons such as COVID-19 restrictions or a
 lack of time (i.e. the “near misses”). We examined for interaction effects between intervention
 arm and the variables above, including key variables like attitudes, as we assumed that the
 impact of the intervention might be different based on responses to attitudes towards contra-
 ception use. These models were adjusted for age, city, COVID-19’s effect on mobility and
 wealth quintile. We report results as odds ratios with 95 percent confidence intervals. A priori
 alpha level was set at 0.05; all analyses were two-sided.
 
<section> Qualitative component
 
<section> Selection, recruitment and consent processes for girls participating in IDIs followed the same
 procedures as those taking part in the quantitative survey. We randomly selected 4éme and
 3éme girls from intervention schools who were interested in participating in the research and
 obtained parental consent where necessary and girls’ assent or consent. At endline, we re-
 interviewed the same girls who had participated at baseline, where possible. Seventeen of the
 48 girls who participated at baseline either were not able to be reached at endline or declined
 to participate a second time and were replaced by 10 new participants.
 We purposively identified implementation staff as participants. Implementation staff
 included game facilitators and health facility staff familiar with (re)solve. KII participants
 included health-facility managers, school principals, parent association members, Ministry of
 Education and Health representatives, and local Pathfinder staff. The research and program
 teams together determined the most suitable participants.
 In IDIs, girls were asked about their knowledge of contraceptive methods, their perception
 of and attitudes toward adolescent pregnancy and sexuality in their communities, their 
<section> personal experience with sex and contraceptive use, and, at endline, their experience with the
 activities of the (re)solve solutions. KII and (re)solve staff participants were asked about their
 perceptions of girls’ sexual and reproductive health as well as their experience with the (re)
 solve program. The research team collaboratively developed interview guides for all participant
 types based on best practices for SRH research and expertise related to the research and cul-
 tural context.
 Following data collection at baseline and endline, the research team transcribed and trans-
 lated recordings of all interviews. Transcripts were not returned to participants. Both the
 English translations and the French transcripts were sent to ICRW, where the research team
 reviewed them for clarity and quality. The verbatim transcripts were analyzed using NVivo 11,
 coded by a team of three researchers from ICRW and Pathfinder International. The team
 developed codes based on the objectives of the qualitative research, namely understanding
 girls’ own sexual activity and use of contraception as well as others’ perceptions of and atti-
 tudes toward these things. Intercoder reliability was conducted on approximately 15 percent
 transcripts for each interview type. Two members of the research team read and coded ran-
 domly selected transcripts of each type, then compared for percentage agreement and Kappa
 coefficient until agreement was deemed sufficient–in most cases above 95 percent for the
 majority of nodes. After all the transcripts were coded, the research team reviewed code
 reports to identify common themes. The focus of qualitative analysis was on girls’ experience
 with the intervention, as well as lessons learned and actions taken as a result of the interven-
 tions. However, we also include observations from baseline interviews with girls as a point of
 comparison, particularly around attitudes toward sex and contraception. We also draw from
 interviews with key informants and implementation staff where relevant, particularly where
 they have commented on the impacts of the program itself related to our quantitative
 outcomes.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> We first present the quantitative data followed by a quantitative section contextualizing the
 qualitative findings organized by two key themes: implementation experiences and attitudes
 toward contraception.
 
<section> Quantitative findings
 
<section> Fig 1 shows the analytical sample flow by study arm for the quantitative component. We col-
 lected data from 2,372 girls at baseline (1,200 in the control and 1,172 in the intervention
 schools), 1,144 girls at midline in intervention schools only (98 percent retention) and 2,072
 girls at endline (1,054 in the control (89 percent retention) and 1,018 in the intervention
 schools (87 percent retention).
 At baseline, our sample was well-balanced on key demographic characteristics and SRH-
 related behaviors (Table 1). Results indicate few differences between control and intervention-
 school girls on key SRH-related intentions and attitudes with one exception. In addition, there
 were few differences at endline between those who dropped out and those who stayed in, sug-
 gesting that dropout was random. Two statistically significant differences were noted: dropout
 girls were much more likely to be from Bobo than Ouaga, and from private schools than public
 schools (Table 
<section> A in S1 Text).
 
<section> Exposure to the (re)solve intervention
 
<section> Of girls participating in the (re)solve research and programming (N = 1,013), 96.2 percent
 (N = 974) reported ever playing the game, and 96.7 percent (N = 950) received a passport. The 
<section> Fig 1. Flowchart of analytic sample.
 
<section> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0000910.g001
 
<section> majority received either two (97.2 percent, N = 803) or more than two (14.1%, N = 143) pass-
 ports to give to other girls, as was intended. The majority of girls (41.9%) reported giving at
 least one passport to a peer at a different school, followed by an older family member (29.9%).
 Ninety-one percent (N = 923) saw the posters in school. At endline, 28.7 percent (N = 291) of
 intervention-school girls had ever gone to a health facility for information or services related
 puberty or menstruation, and 20.1 percent (N = 204) had ever done so for contraceptive infor-
 mation or services.
 Of the 204 girls who had ever gone to a health facility for contraceptive information or ser-
 vices, 194 girls (of 1,013, 19.2 percent of total) reported having gone to a health facility in the
 last seven months (during (re)solve implementation) for contraceptive information or services:
 14.5 percent in Ouaga (N = 75) and 23.9 percent in Bobo (N = 119) (Table 2).
 
<section> SRH intentions and attitudes
 
<section> Table 3 below show the trends between baseline and endline in the community-level geomet-
 ric means for the primary outcome as well as other attitudes variables.
 We consistently found that girls in the intervention schools shifted their contraceptive
 intention and attitudes in desired ways, more than control-school girls. For example, there was
 an absolute shift between baseline and endline of 21.1 in the community-level prevalence in
 the intervention schools of girls reporting that they had the confidence to get and use contra-
 ception, as compared to a shift of only 10.8 among control-school girls.

 Standardized wealth quintiles were created using presence or absence of four household assets variables and validated using principal component analysis. As the
 allocation of schools between arms is carried out randomly, and girls in each schools were randomly selected, any differences that do occur are assumed to be by chance.

<section> Main analysis
 
<section> Our analysis of the association between individual predictors and our primary outcome of
 interest, intention to use contraception in the next three months (Table 
<section> B in S1 Text), revealed
 that only a small number of sociodemographic variables were associated with intention, while
 most of the attitudes toward contraception use were significantly associated with intention to
 use in the next three months.
 The results of our main analyses looking at the impact of (re)solve on intention to use con-
 traception in the next three months are presented in 
<section> Table 4, stratified among various sub-
 groups of girls.
 First, the intervention had a positive impact on intention to use contraception among the
 full sample but did not reach statistical significance in any of the adjusted models, or when
 stratifying the analysis by sexual activity. Across the whole population, girls who received the
 (re)solve intervention had higher odds of reporting intention to use contraception in the next
 three months compared to girls not receiving the intervention (aOR = 1.59, 95% CI 0.97–
 2.61). We observed similar trends for girls who reported ever having sex (aOR = 1.43, 95% CI
 0.79–2.59). Girls in the intervention schools who reported never having sex were almost twice
 likely to report an intention to use contraception in the next three months compared to girls
 the control schools (aOR = 1.80, 95% CI 0.95–3.42). We found no evidence of interaction
 between arm and having ever been sexually active on having an intention to use contraception
 in the next three months (p for interaction = 0.685). Please refer to

<section> We also examined whether the impact of (re)solve was different among girls who went to
 health facility and among girls who reported that they intended to go to a facility but had not
 yet been able to do so (i.e. “near misses”). When we restricted the sample among girls who
 went to a health facility in the intervention group, we found that girls in the intervention
 schools were almost twice as likely to express an intention to use contraception in the next
 three months compared to all girls in the control schools (aOR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.08–3.77 –
 
<section> Table 4). We did not find any significant impact of (re)solve on intention to use contraception
 among girls in the intervention group who did not go to a health facility and among girls clas-
 
<section> sified as “near misses.”
 We looked at whether the impact of (re)solve on intention to use contraception differs by
 responses to attitudes (Figs 
<section> B-G in S1 Text). We only found that intention to use contracep-
 tion in the next three months differs significantly between girls in the control and intervention
 schools who said they felt confident to use contraception secretly (or who agreed or disagreed
 with the statement that they felt confident to use contraception secretly) (p = 0.024).
 Finally, given our hypotheses, we looked at whether the impact of the intervention differs
 by grade and school type (Figs 
<section> H and I in S1 Text). We did not find that intention to use con-
 traception in the next three months differs significantly between girls in the control and

 between girls in control and intervention schools depending on school type. The impact of the
 intervention was greater in the private schools (i.e. girls in intervention schools were more
 likely to report intention to use contraception in the next three months compared to girls in
 the control schools) compared to the public schools (i.e. no difference between control and
 intervention schools) (P< = 0.001).
 
<section> Qualitative findings. We conducted 48 IDIs with girls at baseline and 41 at endline,
 endline IDIs with implementing staff, and 14 endline KIIs with stakeholders. At baseline, girls
 were between the ages of 14 and 18, and at endline, they ranged in age from 15 to 25. 
<section> Table
 presents additional breakdown of participants in qualitative research.
 
<section> Experience with the (re)solve intervention
 
<section> Most girls from the qualitative study component reported enjoying playing the game, learning
 through play, and interacting with facilitators. A 16-year-old girl in 4ème in Ouaga shared,
 “What I liked about this game was the way the facilitators were available to us; they were courte-
 ous, they listened to us, and they gave us good advice. They showed us what path to take to avoid
 pregnancy.” Participants even requested to play the game again. In the IDIs, many facilitators
 noted high engagement by the girls during game play and noted that they personally enjoyed
 the opportunity to act as mentors. One facilitator in Bobo said, “I was able to build good rela-
 tionships with the girls. I also liked the organization and collaboration with the other
 
<section> [facilitators].”
 
<section> Experience at health facilities
 
<section> The game sparked curiosity and encouraged girls to seek more information, and in some cases
 drove them to visit a health facility. Several girls who participated in the endline qualitative
 interviews had gone to a facility for SRH-related information or services. Quantitative results
 showed that intervention girls had more trust in health care workers’ treatment of adolescent
 girls, and qualitative results suggested that girls who visited a health facility overwhelmingly
 had positive experiences. Almost universally, girls who participated in IDIs shared that they
 were seen by a provider quickly and without harassment or embarrassment. As one 16-year-
 old girl in Bobo in 3ème told an interviewer, “The agents [at the health facility] welcomed me
 soon as I presented the passport to them, they gave me a place. .I was comfortable, because all
 the questions were confidential. I felt satisfied.” 
<section> Girls’ reasons for visiting the health facility were primarily to get information and ask ques-
 tions–about menstruation and puberty as well as contraceptive methods. Some were seeking
 care related to painful menstruation, including one 19-year-old girl in Ouaga in 3ème who
 said, “I wanted to know [why] when I am in my menstrual cycle it gives me pain and he [the pro-
 vider] answered all my questions well.” Other girls went to the health facility to learn more
 about a specific method or discuss options available to them, but few were interested or ready
 to take up a method. Some girls visited the health facility with specific questions in mind, or
 confirm things they had heard–most commonly that implants and other methods cause infer-
 tility–while others were generally curious about what the health facility could offer them.
 According to a 21-year-old girl in Bobo in 3ème, "As I had doubts about the implants, I went
 a health facility and it was explained to me.” Similarly, a 16-year-old girl in Ouaga in 4ème said
 she went to the facility because “I wanted to find out if what we have been told at school is the
 same [as] what I would hear at the health facility,” and a 19-year-old girl in Ouaga in 3ème
 said, “We went to find out more about what the game had already told us.”
 
<section> SRH intentions and attitudes
 
<section> At endline, the majority of girls who participated in IDIs (29 girls out of 41, or about 70 per-
 cent), reported that they currently had boyfriends or romantic partners, with relationships
 ranging from a few weeks to eight years long, but most averaging around a year. However, mir-
 roring quantitative findings, few girls were sexually active. Overall, about 66 percent of all girls
 we interviewed had never had sex, and of those who had, many reported that they were not
 currently sexually active.
 Compared to baseline, girls at endline reported more positive attitudes toward contraception
 in general, echoing what we found in the quantitative survey. At baseline, several girls indicated
 in IDIs that they thought contraception was only for married women, and one 16-year-old girl
 in 4ème from Bobo said she does not use contraception because, in her words, “I’m a good girl.”
 At endline, however, a much more commonly expressed feeling was that contraception was not
 relevant–because the girls were not sexually active and did not plan to be in the near future–but
 that contraception was not inherently bad. One 19-year-old girl in 3ème in Ouaga reflected,
 “Contraception! It’s for all girls. It’s a choice. If you want, you can. use it, and if you don’t want
 [to], you leave it. Otherwise it’s for every girl. It depends on what you want.”
 Qualitative results suggest that the solutions challenged girls’ misconceptions about contra-
 ception and taught them how and where to obtain medically accurate information. At baseline,
 a number of girls expressed concerns that contraception would be ineffective or would have
 lasting negative consequences, including trouble conceiving later, but at endline, most girls
 articulated that modern methods of contraception could successfully and reliably prevent
 pregnancy and STIs. A 19-year-old girl in Ouaga in 3ème reported, “I thought contraceptives
 weren’t safe to avoid getting pregnant. But after the game, that changed.” Facilitators remarked
 that girls were motivated to learn and ask questions about contraception, menstruation, and
 sexual health, and a health worker in Bobo said, “I think the girls are starting to understand.
 They buy into it. Especially those who have enough information about contraception, they do not
 
<section> hesitate to take up a method.”
 However, misinformation and fear—especially of a link between contraception, particularly
 implants, and permanent infertility—were still reported at endline by many girls, in both
 quantitative and qualitative data. At endline, a 17-year-old girl in 4ème in Ouaga shared, “I am
 afraid. .of using contraception, because [if I use it,] later on I will have no more children.” These
 fears remain a significant barrier to contraceptive use, and many girls who say they will never
 use contraception cite fear of negative side effects as the primary driver of this decision. 
<section> Girls articulated vague intentions to use contraception at some point in the future, often
 after marriage, at a certain age, or after completing school, to space births and avoid unwanted
 pregnancies. A 16-year-old girl in Bobo in 3ème shared, “[I will use contraception in the future],
 because at some point I will have sex, and I will have to protect myself to avoid unwanted preg-
 nancies.” Even so, the majority of girls who were not currently using a method of contracep-
 tion did not report that they thought it likely they would start to use a method in the near
 future, often because the girls were not currently sexually active and did not expect to become
 so soon. When asked if she saw herself using a contraceptive method at any time, one 15-year-
 old girl in 4ème in Ouaga responded, “No, not really. because I don’t intend to be in a rela-
 tionship.” This offers one explanation for the lack of statistically significant quantitative results,
 but may mirror the positive trend towards intervention girls forming these intentions in the
 future.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> The (re)solve intervention showed promise for supporting adolescent girls in 4eme and 3eme
 to use contraception and potentially avoid pregnancies in two large cities in Burkina Faso.
 This is an important contribution to the field, which has little evidence on successful school-
 based SRH programming for adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa, especially outside of the HIV
 context [8, 21–23].
 Overall, girls and other research participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the
 game and positive experiences at the (re)solve health facilities. Girls enjoyed playing the game,
 asking questions, and learning through gameplay and facilitated dialogue.
 We saw an increase in intervention-school girls’ intention to use contraception in the near
 future—our primary outcome for the evaluation—compared to control-school girls, although
 the relationship was not statistically significant. We noted improvements over time in other
 key outcomes, such as attitudes about contraception and beliefs about girls who use contracep-
 tion among intervention-school girls, as compared to control-school girls. In addition, an
 unexpectedly large percentage of intervention-school girls (365 of 809, or 45.1 percent)
 intended to go to a facility but had not yet gone because of obligations or restrictions such as
 school duties, COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions, or a lack of means, transport or sup-
 port. Intervention-school girls who went to a (re)solve facility were more than twice as likely
 to have an intention to use contraception than girls in the control schools. In addition, there
 were perplexing results related to school type and grade. Given what is known about private
 schools in urban areas in Burkina Faso, it could be that girls in private schools are older or
 have more maturity and experience related to sexual and reproductive health; however, the
 results from all sub-analyses must be interpreted with caution due to cluster size. Understand-
 ing the intersectionality of school type, sociodemographic characteristics of students, and pat-
 terns of reproductive health behaviors in Burkina Faso, or within the sub-Saharan Africa
 region, is an important topic of future research.
 That the intervention did not encourage more girls to form intentions to use contraception
 in the next few months is, in some ways, not surprising. On one hand, intention to use contra-
 ception is likely to be most relevant to girls who are currently sexually active. Yet despite infor-
 mal sources and formative research from our team suggesting that many Burkinabe girls are
 sexually active, our baseline data did not support this. Other evidence from sub-Saharan Africa
 suggests low rates of reported sexual activity among youth [24]. Our qualitative data showed
 that many girls are naïve to relationships with boys, or are in relationships but not sexually
 active, indicating that contraceptive need is not yet relevant in their lives. It is likely that girls
 are experiencing varying degrees of intimacy rather than existing in a binary state of either 
<section> sexually active, or not. In addition, among girls who reported that they were currently sexually
 active at endline (N = 222), 49 percent reported having sex only on a monthly basis and
 another 18 percent reported infrequent sexual activity. Given low frequency of sexual activity,
 contraceptive intention might not be at the forefront of young girls’ minds. In addition, given
 the intervention ended right as lockdowns related to COVID-19 were in place and girls’ mobil-
 ity was restricted, it is also possible that sexual activity—and along with that, intention forma-
 tion related to contraception—attenuated.
 Our sensitivity analyses found some evidence that the intervention had a greater impact on
 girls who have not had sex, although it should be noted that results in either group were not
 statistically significant. Several things could explain this. For example, girls who are sexually
 active might have already considered using contraception and would therefore be more famil-
 iar with such methods compared to girls who are not sexually active. This, in turn, would indi-
 cate that the intervention might have made a smaller impact on their intention to use
 contraception in the next three months. Unfortunately, small cell sizes did not allow for sub-
 analyses among sexually active girls using contraception. In addition, we believe we have mea-
 sured the most critical variables in the casual pathway. Specifically, we looked at whether the
 impact of the intervention on intention to use contraception in the next three months differed
 by different responses to attitudes related to contraception. Our interaction analyses provided
 limited evidence that this was the case across a range of different attitudes.
 We were encouraged by the results suggesting that the intervention shifted attitudes. We
 noted much lower percentages of intervention-school girls (compared with control-school
 girls) with beliefs that contraception causes infertility, that providers stigmatize young girls,
 and that it is normative for unmarried girls not to use contraception. Similarly, there was a
 higher percentage of girls at endline in intervention schools (compared to control schools)
 with beliefs that contraception is an option for them, and who feel confident they can both get
 and use it. This is an important achievement considering that shyness and embarrassment is
 barrier for adolescent access to SRH services [25]. Some of these attitudes, such as having high
 levels of perceived self-efficacy and/or fewer infertility-related fears, have been associated with
 outcomes such as intention to use and contraceptive adoption [26, 27]. However, fears and
 misconceptions are still rampant among school-age girls, especially related to perceptions of
 infertility with modern methods like the IUD and the stigma associated with contraceptive use
 [12]. This is reflected in large, multi-country studies exploring the reasons for nonuse [28–31];
 these myths and misconceptions are indirectly related to contraceptive use [32]. The sticky
 belief that contraceptives causes infertility is usually grounded in deeper social norms around
 proving fertility after marriage and the importance of parenthood [33]. It is unsurprising that
 fear of future infertility would be resilient to a time-bound behavioral intervention such as
 ours.
 The improvements we saw in contraceptive attitudes—coupled with the trends in intention
 to use a method of contraception in the next three months—suggest the (re)solve solutions
 may ‘prime the pump’. The well-received solutions appear to pique girls’ curiosity about SRH,
 including contraceptives. Behavior change, such as getting girls to use contraception, or even
 to hold an intention to do so, is not an overnight process. However, even with this light-touch
 interventions, we can expect modest behavior change: in reviewing exploratory data we found
 a significant increase of the percentage of intervention-school girls reporting they went to
 health facility for SRH information or services, from 6.3% at baseline to 32.2% at endline.
 Girls’ desire to learn about different types of contraception, side effects, menstruation, and
 other SRH topics suggests that the solutions might have been able to move them further along
 in their intention formation. It could be that getting unmarried girls to go to the health facility
 (many for the first time) to gain SRH information and then ensuring a positive interaction 
<section> with the health provider is a gateway to future use of SRH services, including contraceptive
 uptake. Multi-component interventions with activities that address deep-seated norms and
 beliefs are still needed [34]; however, there is also need for focused, light-touch interventions
 that are easily scalable in low-resource settings, much like (re)solve was designed to do.
 Future research is needed to understand whether playing the game more than once ampli-
 fies intention formation and behavior change, or if the game has more influence on sexually
 naïve girls (although the programmatic implications of this are challenging). There may be
 opportunities to expand the solution set to older or younger girls, or girls outside the school
 system; however additional evaluation work is needed. In addition, given the differences by
 school type, additional research and consideration should be made for how the intervention
 might be taken up in private versus public schools.
 
<section> Considerations for the evaluation
 
<section> Several factors should be considered in understanding the results of this evaluation. Generalizabil-
 ity of results may be limited to some in-school girls in larger cities in West Africa. First, although
 we completed a mapping of schools before data collection to inform our sampling frame, it is pos-
 sible our final sample does not reflect the true distribution of public/private schools in both cities.
 This is partly due to selecting schools within the catchment areas of our project health facilities.
 Our effect modification analysis suggests differential impact by school type; therefore, caution
 should be taken when generalizing to all schoolgirls in public and private schools. Second, the
 COVID-19 pandemic arrived as implementation of the game in schools was ending; as a result,
 given restrictions and according to our monitoring data, follow up at the health facility for SRH
 information or services was disrupted, which likely attenuated the impact of the intervention on
 some outcomes. Given eleven percent of girls at endline reported they intended to go to the health
 facility but did not because of COVID-19, we have evidence that fewer girls went for health-facil-
 ity visits for SRH information and services than might have gone in the absence of a pandemic.
 is likely that, as girls were unable to follow up for SRH care at health facilities, those that remained
 sexually active without using protection became pregnant.
 By design, the implementation of (re)solve was staggered, meaning the team completed
 gameplaying in Bobo before turning to Ouaga. In addition, 314 girls in Bobo from the endline
 quantitative survey reported they played the game more than once. Playing the game at a later
 stage or multiple times might have led to differential impact on outcomes, but as this was not
 something we set out to evaluate formally, it remains unknown.
 Even though our previous behavioral diagnosis data indicated that girls would be sexually
 active, we did not find this to be true in our quantitative data. This is likely due to the fact that
 participants tend to feel more comfortable sharing sensitive, personal information—especially
 about their own sexual and reproductive health—in a qualitative interview setting than quanti-
 tatively [35]. Given that our outcome of interest is highly related to sexual activity, our sub-
 group and stratified analyses were underpowered. Caution should be taken in their
 interpretation. In addition, due to low prevalence of our outcome of interest, the lack of statis-
 tical significance in the relationship between the intervention and the outcome might have
 been due to power; however, we note that the trend was in the expected direction, and other
 indicators provide evidence of success. Relatedly, as we used the same model for our analyses
 with attitudinal and behavioral outcomes and stratified analyses, caution should be used in the
 interpretation when the number of clusters in these analyses is less than 15 per arm (for exam-
 ple, stratified analyses by type of school).
 In addition, obtaining accurate data on sensitive topics such as sexual activity and con-
 traceptive use is challenging [36], and it is possible that our data under (or in some cases, over) 
<section> reports on sensitive indicators. To try and counter this, the team spent ample time during
 training on rapport-building tactics, especially for over-the-phone interviews at endline, to
 ensure privacy and a safe space for sharing personal information. In addition, we did quality
 checks throughout endline data collection. However, it is not known the extent that others’
 presence during phone interviews influenced their answers.
 Our CRT design and GEE analysis had several strengths. By randomly assigning the inter-
 vention to schools from a sampling frame of schools with similar characteristics, we believe
 our randomization scheme was successful, and we have confidence in our ability to compare
 our intervention and control groups. We assumed that the correlation matrix was exchange-
 able, which was in accordance with assumptions made using CRT data where observations
 within the same cluster might be correlated, but observations on individuals from different
 clusters are not correlated [18]. We have also accounted for any imbalances at baseline by
 adjusting for baseline values. We did this for two reasons: first in order to reduce between-
 cluster variation in our primary outcome at endline and increase the power and precision of
 the study, and second to take into account regression to the mean. For example, those with
 low observed values at baseline are expected to show an increase in observed value at endline
 even in the absence of any true change, while those with higher observed values at baseline are
 expected to show a decrease [20]. Including a wide variety of stakeholders in qualitative inter-
 views additionally shored up the CRT evidence and bolstered our ability to interpret both
 expected and unexpected findings. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic offered an unplanned
 opportunity to estimate the resilience of our intervention as a stepping stone to accessing SRH
 resources at the clinical level, and to test phone-based consent and interview processes with
 vulnerable population.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> Given the paucity of rigorous data on what works to enhance contraceptive-related outcomes
 for adolescents in West Africa, our findings are an important contribution to the literature.
 With substantial documented barriers to girls’ access of SRH information and services in sub-
 Saharan Africa [24], we are encouraged by the shift this intervention appeared to have in
 boosting girls’ confidence, decreasing negative contraceptive attitudes, and getting girls to visit
 a health facility, or even to intend to visit a health facility.
 Our integrated behavioral solutions are a humble but important contribution to Burkina
 Faso’s efforts to address adolescent health and wellbeing, enable adolescents to make healthy
 choices, potentially reduce the adolescent fertility rate among unmarried adolescents, and reap
 the demographic dividend by investing in its most valuable asset: youth.
