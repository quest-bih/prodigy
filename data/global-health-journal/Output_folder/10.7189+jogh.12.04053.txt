<section> trial
 
<section> Background Pre-conception interventions have the po-
 tential to lower non-communicable disease risk in pro-
 spective parents and reduce transmission of risk fac-
 tors such as obesity to the next generation. The Jom
 Mama project in Malaysia investigated the effectiveness
 of a combined behaviour change communication and
 e-health intervention in young married couples prior to
 first pregnancy. This paper reports the evaluation of the
 effectiveness of this trial.
 
<section> Methods Jom Mama was a non-blinded, randomised
 controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Seremban, Ma-
 laysia, over a period of 33 weeks, covering six contact
 points between trained community health workers and
 newly married couples before the conception of a first
 child. Out of 2075 eligible nulliparous women,
 participated and 305 completed the intervention, with
 145 women in the intervention and 160 in the con-
 trol group. The intervention group received a complex
 behavioural change intervention, combining behaviour
 change communication provided by community health
 promoters and access to a habit formation mobile ap-
 plication, while the control group received the standard
 care provided by public health clinics in Malaysia. The
 primary outcome was a change in the woman’s waist cir-
 cumference. Secondary outcomes were anthropometric
 and metabolic measures, dietary intake (Food Frequen-
 cy Questionnaire, FFQ), physical activity (Internation-
 al Physical Activity Questionnaire, IPAQ) and mental
 health (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, DASS 21). An
 extensive process evaluation was conducted alongside
 the trial in order to aid the interpretation of the main
 findings.
 
<section> Results There were no significant differences of change
 in the woman’s waist circumference between interven-
 tion and control groups at the start and end of the in-
 tervention. While the weight, waist circumference and
 Body Mass Index (BMI) of women in both groups in- 
<section> creased, there was a significantly lower increase in the intervention vs the control group over the peri-
 od of the trial among women who are obese (0.1 kg vs 1.7 kg; P = 0.023, in the intervention and control
 group respectively). In terms of BMI, the obese intervention subgroup showed a slight reduction (0.01)
 compared to the obese control subgroup whose BMI increased by 0.7 (P = 0.015). There were no changes
 in the other secondary outcomes.
 
<section> Conclusions The Jom Mama pre-conception intervention did not lead to a reduction in waist circumfer-
 ence or significant changes in other secondary outcomes over the eight months prior to conception. How-
 ever, there was a significantly smaller weight gain in the intervention vs the control group, predominantly
 in women with pre-existing obesity.
 
<section> Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 70% of deaths globally each year, especially in low- and
 middle-income countries undergoing socioeconomic transitions to Western lifestyles and diets [1]. Diabetes
 mellitus (DM) is one of the most common, but also least recognised NCDs worldwide. Today, 387 million peo-
 ple are living with diabetes, of whom 46.3% remain undiagnosed [1]. DM is an important public health con-
 cern in Malaysia, a middle-income country which has witnessed an increase in DM prevalence among adults
 aged 18 years and above from 11.2% in 2011 to 18.3% in 2019, with a higher prevalence of known diabetes
 among women (9.8%) vs men (9.0%) [2]. Parallel to this is an equally high prevalence of gestational diabetes,
 affecting close to one-third (27.9%) of Malaysian women. Similar trends have also been shown for hyperten-
 sion and obesity [3].
 
<section> Epidemiological data and findings from basic science research suggest that intervening to stop negative be-
 haviours affecting both men’s and women’s weight, nutrition, physical activity, and health behaviours, such
 as smoking, alcohol consumption and stress, can substantially improve health indicators [4]. From the life-
 course perspective, the pre-conception period offers the opportunity to reduce NCD risk in both parents and
 children [5,6]. However, motivating young people to change behaviour at that point in life is challenging, re-
 quiring more than just the provision of information and opportunities [4].
 
<section> Consequently, the Malaysian complex pre-conception intervention, Jom Mama (translated as “Come on, moth-
 er” in Bahasa Malaysia), was designed to “reduce adiposity” in young, recently married, nulliparous women and
 their partners. Malaysia was chosen as a site for a pre-conception intervention trial because of its well-established
 public health system based around regional health clinics serving specific populations. Additionally, couples
 in Malaysia planning to marry routinely seek health screening, especially for Human Immunodeficiency Virus
 (HIV) status, prior to obtaining a marriage licence. Finally, the average age for marriage is 26 years for women
 and 28 years for men [7], and many couples are planning to start a family soon after marriage.
 The Jom Mama project was initiated in 2012 and conducted in three phases: 1) a formative phase to under-
 stand the problem, the lifestyle of young couples, and identify barriers to and facilitators of health [8-11]; 2)
 development of an intervention package based on the results from phase 1; and 3) phase for evaluating the
 intervention package through an RCT [12]. We tested the hypothesis that a complex lifestyle intervention de-
 livered to women and their spouses for 8 months prior to pregnancy would lead to a decrease in the woman’s
 waist circumference.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Design and sampling
 
<section> The trial (conducted from November 2015 to December 2017) was designed as a non-blinded RCT to assess
 the effectiveness of a complex behaviour change intervention in improving the overall health of young wom-
 en prior to their first pregnancy. All women planning to get married in the district of Seremban, in the state
 of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia were targeted for participation. The inclusion criteria for participation were: 1)
 female and between 20-39 years of age; 2) nulliparous; 3) not pregnant at the time of signing the informed
 consent form; 4) owning a smartphone, with either an Android operating system version 4.1 and above or an
 iOS operating system 7.0 and above; and 5) having internet access. Women undergoing treatment for type
 or 2 diabetes mellitus or not residing in the district of Seremban were excluded.
 Seremban district has a similar ethnic composition and diabetes prevalence to the national average [9]. Five
 health clinics in Seremban were identified as data collection sites. A group of primary health care nurses was Effectiveness of a complex intervention to reduce diabetes
 
<section> appointed as data collectors and they received specialised training in data collection. They were not the same
 nurses who were trained to carry out behaviour change communication (BCC), as they were part of the inter-
 vention team. The intervention follow-up period was approximately 33 weeks. The trial was designed follow-
 ing the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 statement [12].
 Women were randomised into the intervention and control arms at the baseline measurement visit with a 1:1
 allocation ratio, using computer-generated random allocation sequences with block sizes of six subjects. Each
 clinic was provided with a sufficient number of identification (ID) numbers with randomisation codes. When
 a subject was enrolled in the trial, the study nurse assigned the lowest available ID number to the subject from
 the list of ID numbers. The Institute for Health System Research (IHSR) of the Malaysian Ministry of Health
 (the main implementation partner) prepared the randomisation lists which were then distributed to the five
 designated primary health clinics in Seremban. A copy was maintained by IHSR. Subjects in the control arm
 received standard care as provided by public health clinics in Malaysia, which did not involve contact with a
 community health promoter (CHP) or access to the Jom Mama app. Control subjects received one phone call
 from a research officer towards the end of the trial period to remind them of their endpoint visit. This paper’s
 authors were blinded to the randomisation codes.
 
<section> Outcome measures
 
<section> The primary outcome of the RCT was a change in the woman’s WC from baseline to after 33 weeks. Secondary
 outcomes were differences between intervention and control groups in any change from baseline to after
 weeks or between the groups at the endpoint in the following variables: weight; body mass index (BMI) follow-
 ing the WHO Asian population cut-off of underweight (<18.5 kg/m ), normal (18.5-22.9 kg/m ), overweight
 (23.0-27.4 kg/m ), obese (≥27.5 kg/m ); waist-to-height ratio; waist-to-hip ratio; glycated haemoglobin A1c
 (HbA1c); fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
 cholesterol, and triglycerides); systolic and diastolic blood pressure; diet as measured by a Food Frequency
 Questionnaire (FFQ) adapted from a locally validated version [13]; physical activity and sedentary behaviour
 as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ); and mental health as measured by
 the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21-item (DASS-21) [12]. Participants answered the FFQ, IPAQ, and
 DASS-21 self-reported questionnaire prior to having their anthropometric measurements and blood samples
 taken by the study nurse. Measurements for waist circumference, hip circumference, weight, height, and blood
 pressure followed standardised procedures based on World Health Organisation (WHO) STEPS surveillance.
 For lipid profile and HbA1c, a 10ml fasting (minimum 9 hours) blood sample was taken by the study nurse
 at the study sites. These procedures followed the trial protocol outlined in Skau et al. [12].
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> The calculation was based on the primary outcome of achieving a 2 cm reduction in change in waist circum-
 ference (WC) between intervention and control groups at intervention completion (33 weeks). Assuming a
 5% level of significance, a statistical power of 90% and a standard deviation (SD) of WC of 5 cm, and using a
 two-tailed t test, 132 women per arm were required. Assuming a 20% attrition rate and an exclusion of 20% of
 participants due to them becoming pregnant before the trial’s completion period, a total of 660 women would
 be required to ensure a minimum of 264 subjects split between the intervention and control arms.
 
<section> Intervention components
 
<section> The intervention aimed to encourage healthy lifestyle changes in young married couples through a combined
 behaviour change communication method implemented by community health promoters (CHPs) during six
 contact points (CPs), along with continuous access to a tailored mobile application. The 48 CHPs were re-
 cruited from within the public health care system and comprised 37 community health nurses, 10 staff nurses,
 and one nursing sister. They were given a four-day training course prior to the intervention, which introduced
 them to the national guidelines for nutrition and physical activity, as well as how to carry out BCC and use the
 Jom app. The course curriculum was developed by local communication experts through a series of consulta-
 tions with multiple stakeholders and assessments of trainees’ prior levels of knowledge and skills. The course
 participants were given a handbook explaining the course content and the outcomes were evaluated using a
 pre-post design. A system was established to provide “peer support” for the CHPs during the intervention. The
 Jom app was developed specifically for the Jom Mama study by an external commercial software developer
 (Cognizant Technology Solutions) and included a function which provided lifestyle challenges that the young
 couples could select. The challenges were focused either on healthy food or physical activity. The app also
 provided a resource section where the couples could access information on healthy lifestyles. Physical activity

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> To the best of our knowledge, Jom Mama is one of the few complex pre-conception interventions that attempt-
 ed to change health in young adults in a middle-income country. The combination of administering the trial
 through the health system, with support from academia and the private sector, offered a unique opportunity
 to capitalise on the outcomes by taking Jom Mama to scale, if appropriate. Furthermore, the trial was prepared
 in collaboration with end-users, the local government, and the health system managers, based on the provi-
 sion of resources necessary for its administration. It was developed systematically, by mapping and including
 relevant preparatory studies. The consort diagram (Figure 1) shows a sufficient number of study participants
 were recruited, so the trial remained adequately powered. 
<section> The baseline data for the trial showed that this sample of young adults recruited in the Seremban region had
 a high prevalence of overweight and obesity (Table 1), as is the case for Malaysia nationally [2]. They were
 also relatively physically inactive, with most activity occurring in the workplace rather than during leisure
 (Table 6).
 
<section> Over eight months, the Jom Mama intervention trial did not result in differences in change in WC between
 the intervention vs the control group. There were, however, statistically significant, albeit small differences in
 weight gain and BMI, where the intervention group had smaller increases than the control group. Subgroup
 analysis showed that this effect was primarily present among obese women in the cohort. There were no sig-
 nificant effects on the other anthropometric, cardiovascular, metabolic, behavioural, and mental health sec-
 ondary outcomes. This suggests that, while the intervention had only a small effect on the population’s overall
 weight, the intervention was beneficial for those women who were already obese.
 While the importance of intervening in the pre-conception period to reduce NCD risk in both women and
 their offspring is widely recognised [15], few interventions were tested in this period rather than in pregnan-
 cy [16]. This is partly due to the definition of the pre-conception period, which offers different opportunities
 depending on the degree of intent to conceive [17].
 
<section> One limitation of our study comes from the challenge of implementing nutritional and other relevant clinical
 guidelines in the population, especially in a low resource setting. Similar challenges were faced in other studies
 [18,19]. The intervention was also delivered to young couples who deemed themselves as healthy individuals
 without a need for encounters with health care services except for acute episodes, which may have resulted in
 a lower level of completion of intervention activities. This trial’s strength is the systematic development of the
 intervention [8-11], staff receiving appropriate training and subsequent support, and the development of a
 dedicated e-health app. A concurrent process evaluation allowed lessons to be learned about the trial’s poten-
 tial limitations, including aspects of BCC and e-health implementation, which may have influenced the trial’s
 outcomes [20]. Furthermore, important lessons were learned about the challenges of recruitment and attri-
 tion, which allowed changes to be made, ensuring an adequate sample size. Despite considerable effort, using
 publicity and numerous promotional materials and exploring several recruitment sites (including communi-
 ty health clinics and marriage registry offices), a low percentage of couples approached agreed to participate
 in the trial. It is clearly challenging to engage this group and ensure active participation to change behaviour.
 This finding has important public health implications, discussed in depth in the accompanying process eval-
 uation paper [20].
 
<section> Despite considerable efforts to train and support the CHPs in delivering the intervention, many did not feel
 comfortable doing so [20]. This may be due to the BCC principles being antithetical to their training as trans-
 mission-focused rather than interaction-focused information communicators. Furthermore, although significant
 resources were invested in developing the Jom app, our analysis showed that it was not widely accessed [20].
 Though the effect on the obese subgroup of women offers hope that an approach similar to Jom Mama might
 have greater beneficial health effects if amplified in various ways, the scale and the cost of the intervention
 make this unlikely, at least in its present form. Further discussion of the public health conclusions is present-
 ed in an accompanying paper [20].
 
<section> The establishment of a novel private-public partnership, comprising the Malaysian Ministry of Health, aca-
 demic researchers from several universities, and a private sector funding partner with an interest in metabolic
 health, was found to be essential in taking on a task of this magnitude. The rationale for pre-conception in-
 terventions is strong, so more research is needed in different parts of the world and with different health care
 systems. However, as the Jom Mama intervention shows, the magnitude of this undertaking is considerable.
 
<section> CONCLUSIONS
 
<section> From a life-course perspective, there is a strong rationale for interventions to improve health among young
 people for themselves now and in the future, and for their future children. In a Malaysian context, the high
 levels of overweight and obesity and low levels of physical activity in young married adults, along with other
 priorities at this time in their lives, make significant lifestyle and health changes difficult. A successful inter-
 vention will depend on striking the balance between sufficient intensity to alter metabolic risk over a short
 time period and designing it in such a way that it is compatible with the target population’s daily life. Despite
 the use of local community health workers, a dedicated app, and considerable effort to sustain follow-up, the
 modest effects of the Jom Mama intervention, primarily on reducing ongoing weight gain in already obese Effectiveness of a complex intervention to reduce diabetes
 
<section> women, make it clear that this is a very challenging problem. The findings of the Jom Mama trial and the ac-
 companying process evaluation [20] provide some guidance to inform future public health policies and health
 promotion programmes.
