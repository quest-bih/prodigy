<section> Maternal mental morbidity and low perinatal health service
 in resource-constrained settings contribute substantially to the
 of poor maternal, newborn, and child health. The commu-
 Mbereko+Men program in rural Zimbabwe engaged women and
 activities to improve men’s support for women and
 equitable, informed health decision-making, and ulti-
 mental health and care-seeking for maternal and new-
 services. The study aimed to test the effectiveness of the Mbere-
 on maternal mental health at 0-6 months after childbirth.
 We conducted a cluster-randomised controlled pragmatic tri-
 two-arm parallel design with four clusters per arm. Data was
 through cross-sectional surveys before and after the im-

 in Mutasa District, Zimbabwe, were randomised using a true
 sequence. Survey participants were women who had giv-
 0-6 months and their male coparents. The primary out-

 and gender dynamics in coparent relationships. Masking was

<iend>

 In the year following childbirth, one in five women in low- and middle-income countries is affected by com-
 mon perinatal mental disorders, typically depression and anxiety, [1]. Maternal mental morbidity makes it more
 difficult for women to care for themselves and their children, or engage with health services, and contributes
 to adverse obstetric outcomes and constrained child growth and development [2]. Risk factors for maternal
 mental morbidity include high-conflict, low-empathy relationships between coparents and receiving low lev-
 els of practical support during pregnancy and the first year after childbirth [1,2].
 
<section> There are effective approaches to improve maternal mental health, care-seeking for maternal, newborn and
 child health (MNCH) services, and male coparents’ practical support for women and babies. Women’s par-
 ticipatory learning and action (PLA) groups and interventions to influence men’s engagement in MNCH have
 separately been found to improve maternal mental health, care-seeking, and maternal and neonatal mortality
 [3-6], while interventions targeting coparents together can improve mutual support and maternal mental health
 [7]. Gender-synchronised interventions target women and men with separate but complementary messages
 and can be an effective approach for addressing interrelated, gendered causes of poor MNCH outcomes [8,9].
 This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a gender-synchronised, low-intensity, community-based interven-
 tion – Mbereko+Men – to improve maternal mental health and MNCH care-seeking in a resource-constrained
 setting. The intervention was designed to achieve change through two interrelated mechanisms: coparents’
 informed and equitable MNCH decision-making, and men’s practical support for women and babies (Figure
 
<section> 1). We hypothesised that, through these mechanisms, the intervention would both improve maternal mental
 health and increase optimal care-seeking for essential MNCH services (Figure 1, Table 1).
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> The study was a cluster-randomised controlled pragmatic trial, using a two-arm parallel design with four
 clusters per arm. The study arms comprised no intervention (standard care) and full intervention clusters.
 The unit of randomisation was the health facility catchment area. Intervention effects were estimated by
 comparing outcome measures between participants sampled independently before and after implementa-
 tion of intervention or standard care, using a study arm by time (pre- and post-intervention) interaction
 term.

<section> Engaging women and men to improve maternal mental health
 
<section> Study sites and participants
 
<section> Women, newborns, and children at the study site in Mutasa District, Zimbabwe, face an unacceptably high
 burden of poor health, with an estimated infant mortality rate of 87 deaths per 1000 live births (2011 data)
 [14]. At provincial level, 30.6% of children are stunted and uptake of MNCH services is low, with births out-
 side health facilities (25.5% of all births) and missed childhood vaccinations (12.9% of children aged 12-23
 months receiving no vaccinations) the highest in the country [15]. Barriers to care-seeking include unequal
 gender norms – which limit women’s participation in decision-making and access to household resources,
 and discourage men from supporting MNCH – as well as limited social support for women, financial resource
 
<section> constraints, and low awareness of the benefits of MNCH services [16,17].
 
<section> Catchment areas of Rural Health Centres or Rural Hospitals in Mutasa District were eligible for inclusion in the
 study if there was no concurrent non-government MNCH program supplementing standard care in the catch-
 ment. Antenatal care attendance records for April-September 2014 were used to identify and exclude sites with
 the lowest estimated birth rates. Sites were excluded if they adjoined an already included site.
 Community-based surveys were aimed to achieve complete enumeration of eligible women and men pre- and
 post-intervention. First, eligible women participants were identified in consultation with village health workers
 through community meetings targeting all parents of young children. This was followed by snowball sampling
 to identify eligible women who had not attended the meetings. Women were eligible to participate in the study
 if they were aged 16 years or older, had resided at the study site for at least 12 months, had given birth within
 the previous six months, and provided written informed consent. Once a woman was enrolled in the study,
 field researchers sought her verbal informed consent to invite the male coparent of her child aged 0-6 months
 to participate in the study. Field researchers then approached the man identified by the enrolled woman as her
 coparent, to assess his eligibility. Men aged 16 years and over, who had resided at the study site for at least
 months, whose enrolled female coparent provided verbal consent for their participation, and who themselves
 provided written informed consent were eligible. Coparents were defined as the biological mother and either
 her current male partner or the man she identified as the father of her child. Relationship status, marital sta-
 
<section> tus, and biological fatherhood were not considered inclusion or exclusion criteria.
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> The Mbereko+Men intervention was delivered through two gender-synchronised components implemented
 separately with women and men. Components were delivered at the cluster level through community-based
 training and discussion groups and were intended to achieve a community-level effect. All women who were 
<section> pregnant or had a child aged up to two years and all men residing in intervention sites were invited to par-
 ticipate in intervention activities. Intervention components were delivered over 12-15 months, depending on
 the cluster, with the intervention progressively scaled up to all four intervention clusters over three months.
 The first intervention component (Mbereko) was delivered by trained local female village health workers, su-
 pervised by a trained female project staff member with over three years of experience in facilitating women’s
 PLA groups. Women participated in PLA cycles conducted through monthly one-hour group discussions, fa-
 cilitated by village health workers in a central community location. Discussions explored MNCH services and
 home care practices recommended during pregnancy and between zero and two years of age, including ser-
 vices for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). Facilitators used flip charts and
 group discussions to share health information and discuss recommended actions. Facilitators supported wom-
 en through PLA cycles grounded in problem-solving therapy [18] to first identify barriers to following recom-
 mended actions, then plan to overcome these barriers with available resources and subsequently reflect on their
 experiences. Each woman was provided with an Action Birth Card, a handheld information and goal-setting
 tool, to support her planning and reflection [19]. Discussion groups were integrated with internal savings and
 lending clubs, delivered through five two-hour training sessions and subsequent meetings at club members’
 discretion, where small clubs formed from discussion group members pooled their savings and jointly decid-
 ed how to invest in income-generating activities and manage interest and repayments interest and repayments.
 Mbereko groups have been implemented in rural Zimbabwe by the Organization for Public Health Interven-
 tions and Development (OPHID) since 2010 [16]. Building upon local evidence that rural women in Zim-
 babwe value male partner support [17,20], this study introduced a second intervention component (+Men).
 The +Men component was delivered by a trained male OPHID staff member who was also a nurse and mid-
 wife with substantial community development experience, targeting men residing in the same communities
 where Mbereko groups were established. Men participated in monthly one-hour group discussions, facilitated
 by the male project staff member in men’s workplaces or a central community location. Discussions explored
 similar health topics to those addressed in women’s groups and the same flip chart was used to present in-
 formation; topics in women’s and men’s groups were sequenced so that women’s insights on gender-related
 challenges relevant to each topic could inform how the topic was subsequently discussed with men. Groups
 also completed facilitated reflections on norms underpinning the gendered division of labour in domestic and
 care work, safe sex during pregnancy, and men’s contributions to MNCH care-seeking. Each men’s group in-
 crementally developed a participatory Men’s Charter for Family Health [21], using facilitated discussion at the
 conclusion of each monthly meeting to identify and commit to principles and behaviours to improve their
 coparents’ and children’s health. After 12-15 months, completed charters were presented to men for public
 display in their community.
 
<section> To support the Mbereko and +Men components, project staff ran two-hour Health Centre Committee meet-
 ings monthly for 12-15 months, bringing together community leaders and health facility staff to review clinic
 performance and community health outcomes and strengthen community-facility linkages.
 
<section> Randomisation
 
<section> The Mbereko+Men intervention was randomised (1:1) at the cluster level by an external researcher who had
 no other involvement in the trial, using a true random number sequence (online random number generator,
 www.random.org). Masking was not used.
 
<section> Study procedures
 
<section> Two independent samples of participants in intervention and control sites were taken before and again after
 12-15 months of intervention implementation. Enrolled participants had a structured questionnaire adminis-
 tered by trained field researchers of the same gender who had current Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) cer-
 tificates. Separate questionnaires were prepared for men and women participants. Questionnaires were devel-
 oped in English, except for the primary outcome measure which had been previously validated in Shona [10],
 the main language spoken by the study population. Questionnaires were translated to Shona and back-trans-
 lated to English by two native Shona speakers fluent in English. Field researchers were native Shona speak-
 ers and administered the questionnaires in Shona. No field researchers who administered the questionnaires
 post-intervention were involved in delivering the intervention. Questionnaires were administered with visual
 and auditory privacy, either at a communal location, in participants’ homes, or over the phone for male par-
 ticipants who were absent from study sites during field data collection. Phone interviews were used in the
 post-intervention survey only, in response to challenges in reaching men during the pre-intervention survey. Engaging women and men to improve maternal mental health
 
<section> Additionally, completed Men’s Charters for Family Health developed in intervention sites were recorded. Af-
 ter the post-intervention survey, the intervention was implemented in control sites.
 The study was retrospectively registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (AC-
 TRN12620001014943) on 7 October 2020. A data monitoring committee did not oversee the study. All study
 participants provided written informed consent prior to their enrolment in the study, with those aged 16-17
 years independently consenting as emancipated minors under national regulations.
 
<section> Outcome measures
 
<section> All primary and secondary outcome measures (Table 1) were defined a priori in the study protocol, approved
 by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe on 28 March 2016 and the Alfred Research Ethics Committee
 on 13 January 2016. The primary outcome measure was women’s mean score on the locally validated [10]
 Shona-language version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a 10-item scale yielding scores
 ranging 0-30, with higher scores indicating more, or more intense, symptoms of depression and anxiety [22].
 One secondary outcome measure was the proportion of women meeting the EPDS cut-off of 11/12, locally
 validated as indicating clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety [10].
 Additional secondary outcome measures were selected to align with the intervention’s hypothesised theory
 of change (Figure 1). Health care-seeking for essential MNCH services was measured using the proportion of
 women who for their most recent pregnancy commenced antenatal care in the first trimester, attended four or
 more antenatal care visits, gave birth in a facility, and reported timely postnatal care for themselves (0-6 weeks
 from birth) and their newborn (0-72 hours from birth), as well as the proportion of women reporting both
 they and their current male partner had completed an HIV test during their most recent pregnancy. Women’s
 participation in decision-making was measured as the proportion of women involved in each, all, and none of
 three categories of household decisions (decisions about major purchases, visits to family, and care-seeking
 for the woman’s health) [23]. Men’s gender attitudes were assessed using men’s mean score on the Gender Eq-
 uitable Men scale, adapted by adding an item dropped during validation but recommended in the validation
 study for use when relevant (“Men can take care of children just as well as women can”) [12]. Couple relation-
 
<section> ship dynamics were assessed using women’s mean scores on the validated Intimate Bond Measure, designed
 to capture respondents’ experiences of their current partner’s behaviour through two individually validated
 sub-scales measuring partners’ emotionally supportive (Care sub-scale) and controlling (Control sub-scale)
 behaviours [13]. Finally, male coparent practical support for women and babies was assessed as the proportion of
 men providing instrumental and financial support across 15 items, developed for this study based on exist-
 ing measures [5,13] and domains identified through previous qualitative work in rural Zimbabwe [17]. Each
 support item was modelled as a binary variable for analysis, either yes vs no or sometimes/usually vs never.
 Plausible adverse events related to increased tension in coparent relationships, resulting from changed ex-
 pectations and behaviours [5]. These were assessed through women’s physical intimate partner violence vic-
 timisation using the World Health Organization validated measure [24], men’s and women’s experiences of
 controlling behaviour perpetrated by their partner using mean score on the validated Intimate Bond Measure
 Control sub-scale [13], and acceptability to women of support provided by their male coparent using the val-
 idated Social Support Effectiveness measure [25].
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> For the primary outcome, linear modelling was used to estimate that a sample size of 880 women (110 wom-
 en per health facility catchment area, divided between pre- and post-intervention time points) was needed
 to detect a difference in means [b] of approximately 2.75 points in EPDS score (small/moderate effect size,
 Cohens d = 0.38) between intervention and control groups, assuming a standard deviation in EPDS of 7.9 as
 previously found in Zimbabwe [10], 5% significance, 80% power, and intracluster correlation of 0.02. How-
 ever, given the non-normal distribution of EPDS scores in the data, linear modelling was excluded, and gen-
 eralised linear modelling (log link function and negative binomial distribution) was instead used to estimate
 the intervention effect on mean EPDS, with a study arm by time (pre- and post-intervention) interaction term
 estimated in addition to main effects for time and study arm. To account for inflation in standard error due to
 cluster randomisation, clustered sandwich estimator was used to estimate cluster robust standard errors. The
 same model structure was applied to estimate intervention effects and standard errors for secondary and ex-
 ploratory analyses, with a logit link function and binomial distribution assumed for categorical variables, and
 ordinary least squares regression modelling undertaken for continuous variables. Exploratory analyses, which
 were not prespecified, estimated intervention effects and standard errors for women’s mean scores on the In-

 or control arms (Figure 2). In intervention sites, activities were
 2016, and delivered until September 2017. Over this period
 of 12-15 months, a total of 35 Mbereko wom-
 en’s groups (comprising 634 women) and 30
 men’s discussion groups (with 781 men at-
 tending) held monthly sessions. Men’s Char-
 ters for Family Health were generated by all
 30 men’s discussion groups between October
 4, 2016, and September 28, 2017.
 
<section> Participants were enrolled at all clusters for
 data collection pre-intervention, between
 April 13 and May 20, 2016, and again post-in-
 tervention between October 19 and Novem-
 ber 30, 2017. No intervention activities were
 conducted in control sites until data collec-
 tion concluded. The questionnaire was com-
 pleted by 436 women and 229 men in the
 intervention arm, and 454 women and 286
 men in the control arm, divided between pre-
 and post-intervention time points (Figure 2).

 on 2014 antenatal care enrolments at includ-

 an estimated 78% of women who had given
 birth 0-6 months before the survey (74% in-
 tervention, 82% control) were sampled. A mi-
 nority of enrolled women reported they did
 not have a male coparent or declined consent
 for their male coparent to be enrolled in the

 to reach 71% of men whose female coparents
 consented for them to complete the question-

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> To our knowledge, this is the first gender-synchronised, community-based intervention study of this kind. The
 intervention reduced symptoms of maternal depression and anxiety and increased care-seeking for MNCH ser-
 vices. These effects were detected together with increased women’s participation in household decision-making,
 decreased controlling behaviour and gender-inequitable attitudes among men, and increased practical support
 provided by men to their female coparents and babies during pregnancy, childbirth and up to six months after
 birth. While no data were captured on health outcomes beyond maternal mental health, observed improve-
 ments in uptake of couples’ HIV testing in pregnancy, timely postnatal care, and support for breastfeeding and
 maternal nutrition during and after pregnancy can be expected to improve MNCH outcomes [26], including
 by strengthening PMTCT in a context of high HIV prevalence [27]. Observed effects were achieved using a
 low-intensity, low-cost model, integrated with the health system and delivered through existing communi-
 ty-based health workers and monthly contacts by two project staff members.
 
<section> Our findings support the study hypothesis (Figure 1) that a gender-synchronised intervention in this setting
 would influence men’s and women’s knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours in complementary ways to improve
 men’s support for MNCH, women’s participation in decision-making, and gender power dynamics in coparent
 relationships, with positive impacts on MNCH care-seeking and maternal mental health.
 
<section> The Mbereko+Men model brings together multiple interventions with demonstrated benefits for MNCH and
 mental health. Well-run women’s PLA groups facilitate mutual psychosocial support and health information
 sharing, and provide structured support for women’s participation in decision-making, to improve maternal
 mental health and MNCH care-seeking [3,4]. Problem-solving interventions using structured participatory
 activities to first identify barriers to participants’ desired outcomes, then plan to overcome these using exist-
 ing resources, have improved women’s and men’s mental health in Zimbabwe [18]. Interventions increasing
 women’s control over cash and other resources have increased the uptake of MNCH services [28]. Male co-
 parent support has previously been identified as an important and modifiable protective factor for maternal 
<section> mental health [1], and interventions that influence men’s engagement in MNCH have improved maternal
 mental health [6], MNCH care-seeking [5], and PMTCT outcomes [27]. In the Mbereko+Men model, men’s
 discussion groups plausibly augmented the established benefits of PLA, problem-solving and microfinance in-
 terventions with women, by enabling men to participate in informed, equitable MNCH decision-making and
 provide improved support to women and babies. Indeed, thematic analysis of participatory charters for fam-
 ily health developed in men’s discussion groups, reported elsewhere [21], found these charters emphasised
 men’s commitments to sharing decision-making, supporting MNCH care-seeking, and contributing to unpaid
 domestic and care work. Furthermore, the rapid [29] community-level changes in men’s gender attitudes and
 supportive behaviours observed in this study suggest that gender-synchronised group discussions held sepa-
 rately with women and men, using family health and parenting roles during pregnancy and early childhood as
 an entry point, are a promising strategy to support gender norm change. Study findings also align with reviews
 highlighting the value of complementary activities with women and men to address gendered determinants of
 poor MNCH [9,30]. Our findings point to coparent relationships as a domain where the harmful impacts of
 entrenched gender inequality on MNCH outcomes [31] may be mitigated by targeting outcomes, such as de-
 cision-making, that are highly sensitive to gender power dynamics in the coparenting relationship [9,17,29].
 The study implementation period was characterised by severe economic and political instability, as well as ma-
 jor political change shortly before the 2017 post-intervention survey. There was minimal disruption to inter-
 vention delivery or data collection since implementation was embedded within government community-based
 health systems with additional support from project staff as required. The rapidly changing context may explain
 the large secular decline in mean EPDS score and prevalence of EPDS≥12 between pre- and post-intervention.
 The main limitation of the study is that the two-arm parallel design did not allow for the testing of the relative
 contribution of activities targeting women compared with those targeting men, or the additional impact of syn-
 chronising these components. However, literature identifying the value of gender-synchronised interventions
 [9,30], combined with the observed individual- and couple-level changes among men and women in this study,
 indicate that study findings document the impact of a gender-synchronised approach, which is plausibly great-
 er than either the women-only or men-only components in isolation. The study was nested in a program with
 limited research-specific funding, and this influenced the study design; in particular, health facility catchment
 areas were selected as the clustering unit to align with the involvement of clinic staff in program implementa-
 tion and limit travel costs. While this meant the intervention implementation was more similar to programs
 delivered at scale, a larger number of clusters would have increased statistical power. The study does not in-
 clude data from eligible women who could not be reached during field research, or their male coparents. The
 study also does not include data from some male coparents of enrolled women: men whose enrolled female
 coparents did not consent to them completing the survey (n = 112), or men who were inaccessible during data
 collection (n = 209). It is not possible to assess how these women and men differ from those who completed
 the survey or determine any intervention effects on their behaviours and attitudes. Most outcomes in the hy-
 pothesised theory of change for the intervention (Figure 1) were measured, but some were not, and this limits
 our ability to infer how observed effects were achieved. The primary outcome of the study is measured through
 women’s self-report, and although multiple studies in Zimbabwe and elsewhere [1,10] confirm the validity of
 the EPDS measure, it is not possible to know whether participants misreported symptoms.
 The non-normal distribution of EPDS scores, with a high proportion of 0 scores, was unexpected. Very low
 EPDS scores have been reported in contexts of chronic adversity, with a cut-off of 5/6 validated as indicating
 clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety in southwestern Nigeria [1]. The 11/12 cut-off pre-
 viously validated in urban Zimbabwe [10] may, therefore, not be generalisable to the rural study population
 in Mutasa District. The difference in effect on mean EPDS between women whose male coparents participated
 in the survey compared with women who declined consent for their male coparent to participate, or whose
 male coparents were inaccessible, may indicate that the intervention is less effective for coparents experienc-
 ing relationship difficulties, despite the community-level effect on maternal mental health. This adds to the
 evidence that underlying relationship dynamics mediate the effect of coparent-focused interventions on ma-
 ternal mental health [7].
 
<section> The Mbereko+Men model is now recommended by the Government of Zimbabwe as a national communi-
 ty-based strategy for PMTCT [32]. Research is needed to assess the effectiveness and implementation fidelity
 of the intervention at scale, and particularly to explore the feasibility of synchronising the Mbereko and +Men
 components at scale. Future studies that engage fathers of young children are an important opportunity to as-
 sess paternal mental health using validated screening tools. Recruiting male survey participants through their
 female coparents provides an important safety mechanism for women. However, future research would cap-
 ture community-level effects among men more accurately if men were recruited directly. This requires care- Engaging women and men to improve maternal mental health

 as well as innovative strategies to directly reach fathers, including mobile men who engage in cross-border or
 seasonal work.
 
<section> CONCLUSIONS
 
<section> Maternal mental morbidity and low uptake of MNCH services in resource-constrained settings are major con-
 tributors to the global burden of poor MNCH [2,26]. Maternal mental health and MNCH care-seeking are
 strongly influenced by gender-related social determinants of health, including gender differences in parenting
 roles and decision-making autonomy.[1,31] Study findings indicate that engaging women and men in separate,
 complementary reflections on gender-transformative health messages is an effective strategy to enhance men’s
 practical support for women and babies and enable coparents’ equitable, informed MNCH decision-making –
 and that these changes can improve maternal mental health and MNCH care-seeking in settings characterised
 by gender inequality and demand-side barriers to MNCH services. Our findings also demonstrate that low-in-
 tensity participatory group discussions with women and men in the same community, delivered using trained
 facilitators (including existing health workers), simple visual aids, and structured participatory activities, are a
 feasible, low-cost, acceptable approach for fostering rapid change in men’s and women’s attitudes, behaviours,
 and interactions within their coparent relationships. Many men and women in rural Zimbabwe and elsewhere
 value the opportunity for both parents to participate in MNCH [17,33]. If feasible and effective at scale, this
 gender-synchronised, low-intensity, community-based approach is a promising demand-side strategy to im-
 prove MNCH outcomes in resource-constrained settings.
