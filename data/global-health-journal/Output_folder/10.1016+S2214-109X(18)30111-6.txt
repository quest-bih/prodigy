<section> Research in context
 
<section> Evidence before this study
 Doxycycline has been widely used in various clinical situations for
 its putative anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring properties. In the
 first weeks after trachomatous trichiasis surgery, progressive
 conjunctival inflammation and contractile scarring mediated by
 matrix metalloproteinase and inflammatory cytokine activity
 might lead to unfavourable outcomes. On Sept 13, 2017,
 we updated a search done for a published Cochrane Collaboration
 systematic review of the management of trachomatous trichiasis
 (Burton and colleagues, 2015). We searched CENTRAL, Ovid
 MEDLINE, Embase, the International Clinical Trials Registry
 Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials
 Registry Platform using the search terms “trachoma” and
 “trichiasis”. Full search methods for each database are available in
 the Cochrane review’s appendix. We found no studies examining
 the effect of doxycycline on trichiasis surgery outcomes.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 To the best of our knowledge this is the first trial investigating
 the use of doxycycline to improve outcomes following trichiasis
 surgery. Our trial was done to investigate whether oral
 
<section> Postoperative trichiasis can lead to vision loss and pain and
 has the potential to undermine elimination efforts. On the
 basis of current clinical practice more than 54 000 patients
 who have surgery for trichiasis develop trachomatous
 trichiasis annually. 1 The leading factors reported to
 contribute to the development of postoperative trichiasis
 include type of surgical procedure, surgeon skill, severity
 of preoperative disease, patient age, and ongoing con­
 junctival inflammation and scarring. 5–8,10,11
 Conjunctival inflammation is frequently observed in
 people with trichiasis. 10,12–18 The drivers of this persistent
 inflammation in individuals with scarring and trichiasis
 have not been fully elucidated; however, it is rarely
 associated with C trachomatis infection. 16,19 Chronic
 conjunctival inflammation is associated with progressive
 conjunctival scarring. 20 Studies 16 in Ethiopia and Tanzania
 found that chronic conjunctival inflammation in tracho­
 matous scarring was associated with the expression of
 proinflammatory cytokines. Conjunctival scarring was
 also associated with increased conjunctival expression of
 matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-7,
 MMP-9, and MMP-12. 21 MMPs degrade the extracellular
 matrix, promote inflammatory cell infiltration, and
 facilitate tissue remodelling and scar formation. In our
 previous studies, 22,23 following trichiasis surgery, patients
 had altered expression of several pro-inflammatory
 cytokines and MMPs, which could favour postoperative
 scarring. In other types of conjunctival surgery
 (eg, trabeculectomy for glaucoma), poor outcomes occur
 because of excessive inflammation and fibrosis during
 initial wound healing, which is mediated by fibroblast
 and MMP activity. Similar alterations in wound healing
 processes are likely to occur following trichiasis surgery
 doxycycline might improve trachomatous trichiasis surgery
 outcomes by suppressing progressive inflammation and
 contractile scarring during the surgical wound healing process.
 The results show that oral doxycycline does not improve surgical
 outcomes following trichiasis surgery, and does not affect the
 extent of postoperative conjunctival scarring or conjunctival
 inflammation, whether this is related to the initial wound
 healing process or longer-term chronic progression.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 This study provides evidence that oral doxycycline does not
 improve outcomes in trachomatous trichiasis surgery, and
 therefore should not be indicated for this purpose. Consistent
 with previous studies, our study showed that other factors, such
 as preoperative disease severity, surgeon skill, and patient age
 are important determinants of outcome, suggesting that
 trachoma control programmes should focus on addressing
 these factors and continue to make efforts to improve surgical
 training and supervision. Further studies are required to
 investigate the association between postoperative scarring and
 trichiasis surgery outcomes.
 
<section> and might contribute to the development of postoperative
 trichiasis and eyelid contour abnormalities.
 To reduce early postoperative trachomatous trichiasis
 due to contractile scarring it might be beneficial to inhibit
 MMP and inflammatory cytokine activity. However, at
 present, interventions used in other types of ophthalmic
 surgery (ie, mitomycin and fluorouracil) would not be
 suitable for patients who have surgery for trachomatous
 trichiasis because of their toxicity, specific handling
 requirements, and high cost. Doxycycline is a widely
 available, broad-spectrum, tetracycline-based antibiotic
 that is effective against C trachomatis, and also has anti-
 inflammatory and anti-MMP properties. 24 Doxycycline
 inhibits MMP activity via several mechanisms: reduced
 MMP expression, blocking pro-MMP activation, and direct
 inhibition by binding Zn² + and Ca² + ions at the catalytic
 site. 24 An in-vitro study 25 examined collagen matrix
 contraction in tarsal conjunctival fibroblasts cultured from
 biopsy samples of individuals who had trichiasis surgery.
 The expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, and
 MMP-12 was significantly higher during the contraction
 assay than at baseline. The addition of doxycycline reduced
 collagen gel contraction by up to 75%, with no evidence of
 toxicity. MMP production was significantly reduced by the
 doxycycline treatment. An ex-vivo study 26 investigating the
 inhibitory effects of doxycycline on MMP-9 in brain
 arteriovenous malformations showed that doxycycline
 significantly decreases MMP-9 concentrations.
 Doxycycline has been widely used in various clinical
 situations because of its putative anti-inflammatory
 and anti-scarring properties, mediated via the inhibition
 of MMPs and inflammatory cytokines, including perio­
 dontitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and vascular disorders, and

 Postoperatively, operated eyes were padded for 1 day and
 tetracycline eye ointment 1% was self-administered twice a
 day for 2 weeks.
 Immediately after trichiasis surgery, patients were
 randomly assigned to receive oral doxycycline 100 mg or
 placebo 100 mg for 28 days. Participants were examined
 at 10 days, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after
 surgery. On day 10, participants were examined for
 postoperative trichiasis and surgical complications
 before suture removal. At 1 month, 6 month, and
 12 month follow-up assessments, participants were
 re-examined (by SA at 1 month and 6 months and EH at
 12 months) and photographed following the same
 procedures used at baseline. The examiners (EH and SA)
 were standardised and had very strong agreement
 for the primary outcome in grading validation studies
 (κ=0·92). On the basis of severity, postoperative
 
<section> data trichiasis was categorised as minor trichiasis (less than
 six eyelashes touching the eye, or evidence of epilation
 in less than a third of the eyelid margin) and major
 trichiasis (six or more eyelashes touching the eye, or
 evidence of epilation in a third or more of the eyelid
 margin). Individuals who had postoperative trichiasis at
 any follow-up assessment were offered epilation or
 repeat surgery by the most experienced surgeon in the
 area on the basis of severity using previously defined
 criteria. 43 Grading of entropion correction, granuloma,
 and eyelid contour abnormalities was done according to
 previously described criteria. Participants with other
 ophthalmic pathologies were referred to the nearest
 eye unit.
 At day 10 and 1 month follow-up assessments, partici­
 pants were interviewed about drug adherence and
 adverse events. Drug adherence was assessed by asking
 participants whether they had stopped taking the
 treatment and by counting the number of capsules
 remaining. If the participant did not bring the medication
 box with them to the follow-up, a member of the study
 team visited the participant’s home to count the number
 of capsules remaining.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome was the cumulative proportion of
 individuals who developed postoperative trichiasis by
 12 months (ie, patients diagnosed with postoperative
 trichiasis at any one of the four follow up visits within

 defined as one or more eyelashes touching the eye or
 clinical evidence of epilation, or a history of repeat
 trichiasis surgery by 12 months.

<section> Results
 
<section> Between Dec 21, 2015, and April 6, 2016, 3593 individuals
 were assessed for eligibility, of whom 1722 (48%) had
 trichiasis, 1422 (40%) had another ocular problem,
 and 449 (12%) had no ocular problems. Of the
 1722 individuals with trichiasis, 707 (41%) were ex­cluded:
 344 (49%) had postoperative trichiasis, 175 (25%) had
 trichiasis with­ out clear tarsal conjunctival scarring,
 111 (16%) were lactating, 19 (3%) were pregnant,
 16 (2%) had high blood pressure, 12 (2%) had mental
 health or hearing problems, nine (1%) were younger than
 18 years, seven (1%) had kidney or liver problems,
 six (1%) were unable to attend follow-up, six (1%) were
 taking other multiple drugs, one (<1%) was taking
 doxycycline, and one (<1%) was seen after recruitment
 had been completed. Of the 1015 eligible participants,
 15 (1%) declined surgery. Thus, 1000 individuals with
 trichiasis were enrolled, and randomly assigned to receive
 doxycycline (499 patients) or placebo (501 patients; figure).
 All but one participant in the doxycycline group attended
 at least one follow-up assessment. Thus, primary outcome
 data were available for 999 (100%) of 1000 trial participants:
 498 in the doxycycline group and 501 in the placebo group.
 Of the 992 participants seen at the 1 month follow-up
 (492 [99%] of 498 in the doxycycline group; 500 [100%] of
 501 in the placebo group), 815 (82%) participants had
 adhered to study treatment: 392 (48%) in the doxycycline
 group, and 423 (52%) in the placebo group (OR 0·71,
 95% CI 0·51–0·99, p=0·04). Adherence was similar
 between sexes (228 [80%] of 284 men vs 587 [83%] of
 708 women). However, older individuals (aged ≥60 years)
 were less likely to adhere to the study drug than younger
 individuals (OR 0·77, 95% CI 0·68–0·87, p<0·0001).
 Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics
 for were balanced between the two groups, with the
 of exception of preoperative trichiasis severity (table 1).
 of The mean age was 51·0 years (SD 14·1), and most
 for participants were women (701 [70%]), and illiterate
 (881 [88%]). Clinical features, including visual acuity,
 corneal opacity, tarsal conjunctival scarring and
 inflammation, and entropion grade were similar across
 the two groups. The number and location of eyelashes
 touching the eye were balanced between the two groups.
 However, the proportion of participants with major
 trichiasis was higher in the doxycycline group than the
 placebo group (255 [51%] vs 222 [44%]) when extent
 of epilation was included in the trichiasis severity
 definition. 272 (54%) of 501 participants in the placebo
 group and 274 (55%) of 498 participants in the doxycline
 group had evidence of epilation. Of the 546 participants
 with epilation, 327 (60%) had epilation in less than a
 third of the eyelid (165 [33%] in the placebo group vs
 of 162 [32%] in the doxycycline group), and 219 (40%)
 to had epilation in a third or more of the eyelid margin
 for (107 [21%] vs 112 [22%]). 25 (5%) of 501 participants in
 the placebo group and 34 (7%) of 499 participants in the
 doxycycline group successfully epilated (no lashes
 touching).
 By 12 months, postoperative trichiasis had developed in

<section> Discussion
 We tested the hypothesis that doxycycline could reduce
 the risk of postoperative trichiasis by reducing MMP and
 pro-inflammatory cytokine activity, thereby reducing
 inflammation and fibrosis during the initial wound
 healing stage. However, in this trial, we found no evidence
 to support this theory, with similar surgical outcomes
 observed between the doxycycline and placebo groups.
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
 have investigated the effect of doxycycline on surgical
 outcomes after trichiasis surgery. Although, fewer people
 in the doxycycline group adhered to study treatment
 than did those in the placebo group, per-protocol analysis
 found no difference in the risk of postoperative trichiasis
 between groups, when the analysis was restricted to
 participants who reported adherence at 1 month.
 The rationale for this trial was that persistent
 conjunctival inflammation and progressive scarring after
 trichiasis surgery might contribute to the development
 of postoperative trichiasis. Several studies 10,12,13,17,44,45 have
 found severe conjunctival inflammation before and after
 surgery is associated with postoperative trichiasis. Pre­
 operatively, clinically visible conjunctival inflammation

<section> The risk of postoperative trichiasis 1 year after PLTR
 surgery was relatively low (12% in both groups). These
 results were similar to those previously reported for PLTR
 surgery (13%), suggesting consistent performance of this
 procedure in this context. This risk was lower than
 anticipated in the power calculation. However, our study
 had sufficient power to detect a halving of the postoperative
 trichiasis risk from 12% to 6%. Some evidence indicated
 that the intervention effect might be modified by sex;
 however, stratum-specific estimates did not support this
 finding. However, because the study was not powered to
 detect a difference within these strata we cannot make
 robust conclusions about the absence of an effect. In this
 study, the main determinants of postoperative trichiasis
 were pre­operative trichiasis severity (major trachomatous
 trichiasis), peripheral trichiasis eyelash location, inter­
 surgeon variability, and patient age, which have consistently
 been reported in previous trials. 6,46
 The risk of clinically significant (moderate and severe)
 eyelid contour abnormalities after trichiasis surgery
 was similar between treatment groups throughout the
 12 month follow-up. The risk was relatively high
 at 1 month (14% in placebo group vs 15% in doxycycline
 group), but declined to 7% in the placebo group and
 7% in the doxycycline group by 6 months and to 4% in
 the placebo group and 6% in the doxycycline group by
 12 months. Most participants who had clinically signifi­
 cant eyelid contour abnormalities at 1 month had
 improvement by 6 months and 12 months: only 33% of
 participants at 6 months and 25% of participants at
 12 months still had clinically significant eyelid contour
 abnormalities. The gradual improvement in appearance
 of eyelid contour abnormalities is presumably due
 to ongoing changes within the eyelid tissues, with
 reshaping of scar tissue, which has implications for
 both patients and trachoma control programmes. Poor
 cosmetic outcome is sometimes cited as a reason to
 decline surgery, so it is encouraging that eyelid contour
 abnormalities can improve. Additionally, these results
 suggest that for all but the most severe eyelid contour
 abnormalities, in which clinically significant incomplete
 eyelid closure (lagophthalmos) might occur, repeat
 eyelid surgery might not be required since improvement
 occurs in most patients. Long-term longitudinal studies
 are required to determine the proportion of patients
 who have surgery but remain with disfiguring eyelid
 contour abnormalities and how these should be
 managed.
 The factors associated with eyelid contour abnormalities
 were similar to those for postoperative trichiasis—ie,
 preoperative trichiasis severity (major trachomatous
 trichiasis), intersurgeon variability, and patient age.
 The only modifiable factor was surgeon skill, indicating
 the need for robust training programmes and ongoing
 supervision. Patients with severe trichiasis should be
 managed by the most experienced surgeons wherever
 possible.
 
<section> Although doxycycline had no effect on the outcome of
 trichiasis surgery in this trial, the wider ophthalmic
 literature 26–34 suggests that the drug might be beneficial
 in a number of different clinical situations. In
 ophthalmic practice, the drug is used to help promote
 healing of recurrent corneal erosions, possibly via
 anti-MMP-9 activity. 47 Oral doxycycline is reported to
 improve chronic blepharitis, possibly in association with
 anti-MMP-9 activity. 48 Two case reports 29 of pseudomonas
 corneal melting suggest oral doxycycline helps to
 stabilise corneal breakdown via the inhibition of MMPs,
 and is widely used in clinical practice for this reason.
 Oral doxycycline was reported to be effective in inhibiting
 corneal neovascularisation and improved epithelia cell
 healing in rat corneas exposed to alkali, and is widely
 used in clinical practice for the treatment of alkali
 injuries.
 The use of doxycycline in the treatment of systemic
 conditions has had mixed results. The drug is licensed for
 use in the treatment of periodontitis; several placebo-
 controlled randomised clinical trials 50 have demonstrated
 that sub-antimicrobial doses can suppress MMP-mediated
 degradation of connective tissue in the periodontal
 structures. Clinical trials 31 have also shown that patients
 with rosacea respond to anti-inflammatory doses of oral
 doxycycline. Several studies 51 have examined whether the
 enlargement of abdominal aortic aneurysms can be
 slowed by oral doxycycline, mediated through opposing
 MMP-9 activity, but no evidence has suggested that it is
 effective for this indication. Doxycycline has also been
 proposed as a treatment in pulmonary fibrosis, although
 convincing trial data are not available at present.
 In this study, treatment-associated adverse events were
 uncommon and generally mild. Adverse events were
 more frequently reported with doxycycline than placebo,
 which might explain why significantly fewer people in
 the doxycycline group were compliant when compared
 with the placebo group. The risk and type of advese
 events reported were similar to those reported in a large
 community-based trial 35 of doxycycline (100 mg per day
 for 6 weeks) for onchocerciasis in Cameroon, in which
 3% of the trial participants reported nausea, vomiting,
 diarrhoea, and tiredness.
 A potential limitation of this trial is the risk of
 unmasking when examiners counted the number of
 capsules left in the randomisation box to collect adherence
 data. However, we consider this highly unlikely since the
 two treatment capsules were identical.
 Overall, doxycycline was found to have no effect on the
 proportion of participants who developed postoperative
 trichiasis or other unfavourable outcomes, and therefore
 is not indicated for this purpose. Preoperative disease
 characteristics, patient age, and surgeon skill seem to be
 the main determinants of outcome following trichiasis
 surgery. Trachoma control programmes and their
 partners should continue to make efforts to improve
 surgical training and supervision.
