<section> among a suite of population and demography
 programmes.
 Family planning has received renewed
 policy interest with the Sustainable Develop-
 ment Goals specifically identifying universal
 access to family planning as a major priority. In
 response to evidence that family planning had
 been neglected as a health systems priority in
 sub-Saharan Africa, 7 many countries invested
 significant resources in improving access to
 family planning as part of the Family Planning
 2020 global partnership, with recent evidence
 illustrating significant progress in addressing
 unmet need in Kenya.
 Despite these advances, take-up of modern
 methods remains low during the critical post-
 partum period. 9–11 In particular, poor house-
 holds’ utilisation of modern contraceptives
 has consistently lagged behind national aver-
 ages across most of sub-Saharan Africa. 12 A
 study conducted among the slums of Nairobi
 found that 20% of second and higher order 
<section> births occurred within 24 months of the previous birth
 and 9% occurred within 18 months. 13 Another recent
 study found that a significant majority of women in
 Nairobi have not taken up modern contraception at the
 time of resuming sexual activity in the postpartum period,
 leaving them only partially protected from shortly spaced
 births.
 Efforts to improve access to postpartum family plan-
 ning and ensure equity in the availability of modern
 contraception across socioeconomic groups have driven
 the design of interventions to reduce financial barriers
 to the take-up of contraception. 15 Cost is a particularly
 important barrier to use of long-acting reversible contra-
 ception (LARC) methods such as implants and intra-
 uterine devices (IUDs) and systems, which are 20 times
 as effective as other methods 16 but typically require more
 out-of-pocket spending. However, reductions in finan-
 cial barriers have not always led to expected increases in
 postpartum contraception. An evaluation of a voucher
 programme in Kenya offering subsidised long-acting
 family planning methods to poor households found that
 only 2% of households used the vouchers. 17 Financial
 barriers may not be the only reason that new mothers
 desiring to postpone or avoid pregnancy do not take up
 modern contraception.
 The postpartum period poses unique challenges for
 mothers. They must balance the many demands of a new
 baby with other longer term priorities such as avoiding
 or delaying future pregnancies. Research in behavioural
 science suggests that the many cognitive demands of
 living in poverty may deplete mental resources for
 forward-looking activities, 19 20 such as taking steps to
 avoid unwanted future pregnancies. The possibility of
 becoming pregnant may not be at the ‘top of mind’
 and the immediate costs of going to a clinic to access
 a modern contraceptive method may loom larger than
 the longer term benefits. Delivery strategies incorpo-
 rating behavioural ‘nudges’ 18 into the delivery of post-
 partum family planning may be particularly important
 for households living under the cognitive load of poverty.
 Principles from behavioural science have increasingly
 been used to design policy innovations. However, there
 is very limited evidence on the impact of interventions
 informed by behavioural science to improve maternal
 and child health.
 We conducted a randomised controlled trial with a
 chain of private maternity clinics in the informal settle-
 ments of Nairobi to evaluate the impact of a free voucher
 for modern contraception and two behavioural ‘nudg-
 es’—a deadline for using the voucher and a short message
 service (SMS) reminder—on the take up of contraception
 in the postpartum period. Treatments were designed in
 collaboration with staff from the study clinic and conver-
 sations with patients. We focused our design on inte-
 grating behavioural insights into interventions (vouchers
 and SMS) that were likely to be policy relevant and scal-
 able. Introducing a deadline to encourage earlier action
 has been found to increase the chance of taking action
 in education and consumer behaviour, 23 while reminders
 have been shown to increase the likelihood of many
 health behaviours including appointment attendance
 and medication adherence. 24 This project is among the
 first to test whether incorporating simple, low-cost nudges
 to traditional reproductive health voucher programme in
 low-income countries can increase their effectiveness by
 targeting behavioural barriers to utilisation at the same
 time as financial constraints.
 
<section> Methods
 Study setting and population
 The study was conducted between April 2014 and
 December 2015 in two private maternity clinics in Nairo-
 bi’s informal settlements (Kiambu County). These densely
 populated areas are characterised by high poverty rates,
 poor access to water and sanitation and food insecu-
 rity. 25 26 Total fertility rates for women in Nairobi’s urban
 poor regions are slightly higher than that of Nairobi (3.1
 compared with 2.8) yet still lower than rural areas and
 the national average of 4.6. 26
 We recruited pregnant women attending antenatal
 care (ANC) at Jacaranda Health, a private-sector social
 enterprise providing maternal and newborn healthcare
 to poor urban women. At the start of the study, Jacaranda
 operated one maternity facility with a second facility
 opening in September 2014.
 
<section> Intervention design, procedures and timeline
 Women were eligible to participate in the study if they
 attended ANC services at Jacaranda, were between
 years and 40 years old, had a gestational age of at least
 months at the time of enrolment and could provide a valid
 phone number by which they could be reached in the
 postpartum period. Six hundred and eighty-six women
 attending ANC were consented and enrolled over that
 time period. Pregnant women were randomly assigned
 with equal probability to a ‘standard voucher arm’, a
 ‘deadline voucher’ arm or a control group. Both voucher
 arms received a voucher for free contraceptive methods
 to be redeemed at a Jacaranda Health facility, including
 condoms, injectables, implants, IUDs, combined and
 progestin-only oral contraceptives and counselling on
 effective use of the lactational amenorrhoea method
 (LAM). The value of the voucher ranged from US$0.92–
 US$6.45 depending on the method choice, with the
 largest value for the LARC methods of implants and
 IUDs. The ‘deadline voucher’ voucher expired 8 weeks
 after estimated date of delivery (EDD) and the ‘standard
 voucher’ expired 1 year after it was issued. A sample of
 each voucher is provided in online supplementary figure
 1. The expiry date was made highly salient in the deadline
 voucher but not in the standard voucher. We used the
 EDD to determine the deadline date because the delivery
 date was unknown at the time of enrolment. Partway
 through the study, additional funding was received,
 which allowed us to expand the study (we refer to these 
<section> periods as study phase 1 and phase 2). Around the same
 time, Jacaranda Health opened another maternity clinic,
 allowing for a larger potential sample size for the study.
 During the initial study period, we had observed unex-
 pectedly low rates of redemptions of vouchers. Motivated
 in part by this observation, we designed an additional
 intervention to remind households of the opportunity
 to take up postpartum family planning. In November
 2014, a cross-randomised additional treatment arm was
 added to the study design. Of the 686 total of women
 enrolled in the study, 339 were enrolled after November
 2014 and, in addition to being randomly assigned with
 equal probability to one of three voucher arms, were
 also cross-randomised with equal probability into an arm
 that received a postpartum (5 weeks) SMS reminder or
 an arm receiving no SMS message, resulting in six treat-
 ment arms. Additional details about the study design
 and randomisation method are provided in the online
 supplementary appendix. Flow into experimental treat-
 ment arms is illustrated for each study phase in online
 supplementary figure 2a and bonline supplementary
 figure 2abonline supplementary material
 All participants, including the control group, received
 counselling and educational materials on postpartum
 family planning, including information on appropriate
 methods for the postpartum period and a recommenda-
 tion to initiate postpartum family planning 6 weeks after
 delivery. Because some women in the no-voucher group
 also got the SMS reminder and because some households
 share access to cell phones and may have wanted to main-
 tain privacy around decisions about family planning, the
 SMS did not specifically refer to the voucher but instead
 read: ‘Don’t forget to review your family planning mate-
 rials from Jacaranda Health’.
 
<section> Data collection and outcomes
 Participants were recruited in the waiting room of Jaca-
 randa’s antenatal clinics. Eligible participants were
 consented into the study by providing their written
 consent. Participants completed a baseline survey at the
 antenatal clinic with questions about basic demographic
 characteristics and fertility preferences. Survey timing
 and outcome measures are defined with respect to the
 EDD rather than the actual delivery date in order to
 be consistent with the deadline and SMS intervention,
 which were scheduled with respect to EDD during preg-
 nancy. Follow-up surveys were conducted by phone at
 9, 12, 22, 36 and 52 weeks after EDD to assess timing of
 postpartum contraceptive take-up and method choice.
 Enumerators made multiple attempts to contact partic-
 ipants within a period of 3–4 weeks. Enumerators were
 trained to probe on the timing of contraceptive take-up
 if the participant did not remember the exact date with
 the enumerator providing assistance in estimating the
 date of contraceptive use. Everyone who participated
 in a phone survey was sent phone credit worth between
 US$0.46 and US$0.92 as an appreciation for participa-
 tion. Data were also extracted on utilisation of care at
 Jacaranda from Jacaranda’s administrative database from
 the start of the study through June 2016 (ensuring at least
 7 months of follow-up administrative data for all partici-
 pants) including all information on visits to Jacaranda for
 family planning, any contraceptive methods received and
 any payments made for family planning. Finally, we kept
 programmatic data on the vouchers that were provided to
 study participants, whether vouchers were redeemed and
 information on when SMS reminders were sent. Addi-
 tional details on data collection procedures are provided
 in the online supplementary technical appendix.
 Our primary outcome was self-reported current use of
 a modern contraceptive method. Modern contraception
 was defined as including IUDs and intrauterine systems,
 implants, oral contraceptive pills, emergency contracep-
 tive pills, condoms, injectables, patches, diaphragms/
 cervical caps, spermicides, vaginal rings, vaginal sponges
 and sterilisation. While the World Health Organization
 (WHO) includes LAM in their definition of modern
 contraceptive methods, LAM is sometimes distinguished
 from other modern methods 28 as it can be effectively
 practised with no costs, facility visits or products. Evidence
 suggests that practice of LAM often lacks the reliability of
 other methods and many mothers who report practising
 LAM are not actually protected against pregnancy. 29 The
 exclusion of LAM from our primary outcome of current
 use of modern contraception is consistent with our
 preregistered study outcome.
 In order to understand the behavioural response to
 treatments, we also reported post hoc analysis on an
 outcome constructed from administrative data: take-up
 of a modern contraceptive method at Jacaranda. Self-re-
 ported survey data about take-up of contraception was
 preregistered as our primary outcome instead of using
 administrative data from the study facility because our
 treatments sought to increase the salience of desires
 around postpartum family planning, which may have led
 participants to seek family planning in whatever clinic
 was most convenient (not necessarily in the clinic where
 they received ANC).
 We report on modern contraceptive use in the ‘short-
 term’ and ‘medium term’, which we define as 9 weeks and
 22 weeks after EDD. These time points were chosen to be
 as close as possible to our first two waves of data collec-
 tion in order to minimise recall bias. If we were unable
 to complete one of the surveys, we inferred use at that
 time-point from future surveys whenever possible. So, for
 example, for a respondent who did not complete a 9-week
 survey but did complete a 22-week survey, we constructed
 her use of modern contraception at 9 weeks based on
 whether she was using a method at the 22 week survey
 and her report about when that method use started. This
 method avoided losing data for inference but cannot
 account for discontinuation. Short-term modern contra-
 ceptive method use corresponds to a period shortly after
 the WHO recommendation of contraceptive take-up by
 weeks and allowed us to observe the immediate effects of
 the SMS and deadline treatments. In order to understand 
<section> how interventions influenced method choice, we
 consider a secondary post hoc analysis not included in
 our preregistered outcomes that examines whether study
 participants are using a LARC method (defined as use of
 an implant, intrauterine system or IUD).
 
<section> Analytical approach
 We estimate risk differences between treatment arms and
 the control group using ordinary least squares (OLS)
 with robust standard errors (SEs.) We use a linear model
 for ease of interpretation 30 and estimate heteroscedas-
 ticity robust SEs to avoid bias. 31 In our first model, we
 include a control for study phase and enrolment facility
 (stratification variables) in order to maximise power. 32 In
 the fully adjusted model, we included the following addi-
 tional covariates: maternal age (continuous), a binary
 variable indicating whether a mother was multiparous,
 a binary variable indicating some secondary education
 or higher, a binary variable indicating previous use of
 modern contraception, a binary variables indicating that
 the mother did not want future children and a binary vari-
 able indicating that her partner did not want future chil-
 dren, a binary variable for intention to use postpartum
 FP in the short-term, a continuous variable for the days
 between enrolment and the EDD, a continuous variable
 indicating travel cost to a study health facility, a binary
 variable indicating that the participant's residence was
 in the same sublocation as a study facility and a contin-
 uous variable indicating the date of study enrolment. We
 used case deletion for missing data and dummy-variable
 adjustment to account for missing covariates. 33 In order
 to further explore patterns in our results, we construct
 a forest plot that compares the relationship between
 take-up of family planning and (1) our main interven-
 tions: receiving any SMS and receiving any voucher
 and (2) participant characteristics including education,
 self-reported intentions during ANC about take-up of
 postpartum family planning in the short-term. Coeffi-
 cients were generated from OLS regressions of the vari-
 able of interest on the primary outcome of self-reported
 use of a modern method in the medium-term controlling
 for stratification variables (study phase and facility) with
 robust SEs.
 Descriptive statistics on covariates were presented for
 the randomised sample and the sample followed to short-
 term and medium-term outcomes and p-values were
 reported for the test of differences in means between
 the randomised sample and the short-term and medi-
 um-term analysis samples. We report on two measures
 of treatment fidelity using programmatic data: whether
 the voucher that was randomly assigned was provided to
 the study participant and whether an SMS was sent within
 1 week of the scheduled time (5 weeks after EDD). We
 also presented descriptive statistics on voucher redemp-
 tions, the monetary value of methods received using
 the voucher and the timing of voucher redemptions
 using programmatic data. We also presented descriptive
 statistics on method type, location, cost and timing for
 the first modern method initiated among the sample of
 participants ever reporting that they initiated a modern
 method in any of our surveys. We presented robustness
 checks in online supplementary tables, including sepa-
 rate estimates for the two study phases of data collection,
 estimation of our main results with LAM included in
 the definition of modern method use and estimation of
 our main results using multiple imputation for individ-
 uals with missing outcome data. In order to understand
 concordance between self-reported survey data and
 administrative data, we report comparisons of the rates
 of agreement between survey and administrative data for
 the primary outcomes among the short-term and medi-
 um-term analysis samples, including an analysis of the
 reported location where care was received among those
 reporting use of a modern method. We also present the
 distribution of methods obtained in each treatment arm
 for those self-reporting use of modern method in the
 medium term using a stacked bar graph.
 
<section> Ethics
 
<section> This study was approved by Institutional Review Boards
 at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and the
 Ethical and Scientific Review Committee of Amref Health
 Africa (AMREF) in Nairobi, Kenya. The study design was
 registered at ​soci​alsc​ienc​ereg​istry.​org with identification
 number AEARCTR-0000320.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Of the 686 study participants enrolled in the study,
 we followed 78% of the sample (537 respondents) to
 collect data on the short-term outcomes with 17% of
 responses from the 9-week survey, 79% of responses
 from the 12-week survey and 3% of responses from
 the 22-week, 36-week or 52-week survey. We observe
 61% of the sample to collect data on the medium-term
 outcomes (418 respondents), with 90% of outcomes
 constructed using the 22-week survey, and 10% of
 responses constructed using the 36-week or 52-week
 survey. The short-term and medium-term contraceptive
 use outcomes correspond to a mean of 63 days after
 actual delivery (95% CI 62 to 64) and 154 days after
 actual delivery (95% CI 153 to 155) among our study
 participants.
 We present characteristics of the study sample in
 table 1. Sixty-seven per cent of participants report
 having used modern contraceptive methods in the past.
 Thirty per cent of respondents report not wanting any
 more children, while 21% reported that their male part-
 ners did not want more children. Thirty-two per cent
 of study participants reported during their pregnancy
 that they hoped to start using modern contraceptive
 methods by the short-term outcome time-point defined
 in our analysis. Women were an average of 42 days from
 their EDD at the time of enrolment. The average partic-
 ipant had travelled 30 min to arrive at the maternity
 clinic for care. Characteristics of the enrolment sample

 Modern contraception includes the following methods: sterilisation (female or male), intrauterine devices and systems, implants, oral
 contraceptive pills (combined and progestin-only), emergency contraceptive pills, condoms (male/female), injectables, patches, diaphragms/
 cervical caps, spermicides, vaginal ring and vaginal sponge. P values generated using ordinary least squares estimation. All models include
 a binary variable indicating enrolment facility and a binary variable indicating study phase (1 or 2). Antenatal intention to use short-term
 postpartum contraception is defined as a stated baseline intention to use contraception by 9 weeks postpartum. P values generated using
 t-tests assuming unequal variance.

 Table 1 Baseline characteristics of randomised and surveyed samples 
<iend>

 and the sample reached for the short-term and medi-
 um-term contraceptive use outcome were similar. We
 report descriptive statistics separated by treatment arm
 for the randomised sample (online supplementary
 table S3a), short-term sample (online supplementary
 table S3b) and medium-term sample (online supple-
 mentary table S3c). In online supplementary table S4,
 we present rates of follow-up surveys by treatment arm
 and phase. Rates of follow-up on primary outcomes
 tended to be slightly lower in the control arm, but
 characteristics of the follow-up samples were largely
 balanced across treatment arms.
 We present information about treatment fidelity,
 redemption of study vouchers and take-up of post-
 partum contraception in table 2. The vast majority of
 participants received the treatment they were assigned
 to receive, with 98% of those assigned to receive a
 voucher receiving the correct voucher and 95% of
 those assigned to receive an SMS being sent an SMS
 within 1 week of the scheduled time. Twenty per cent of
 study participants assigned to receive a voucher for free
 contraception redeemed the voucher at study clinics.
 Among self-reported users of modern contraceptive
 methods who report currently using a LARC method by
 the short-term follow-up, 42% redeemed their voucher,
 while just 17% of users who chose a non-LARC method
 redeemed their voucher. The value of the average
 voucher redeemed was $4.26. The average value of the
 voucher redemption for LARC methods was $4.92 and
 for non-LARC methods was $2.59. Among all those
 who redeemed a voucher, the average number of days
 between EDD and redemption of the voucher was
 days.
 At first postpartum contraceptive initiation, the most
 common methods were implant (32%), injectables
 (27%) and contraceptive pills (27%). Thirty-seven
 per cent of participants reporting modern contracep-
 tive use first initiated contraceptive methods at the
 private clinic where we enrolled study participants,
 while others accessed contraceptive methods at a
 public facility (27%), other private facility (21%) or
 ‘chemist’/pharmacy (15%). At first postpartum use of

 control arm (95% CI 6 pp to 44 pp). The estimated
 impact of the SMS alone was also large, though the CI
 is imprecise (16 pp, 95% CI −6 pp to 38 pp). None of
 the other treatment arms were estimated to statistically
 significantly increase the likelihood of modern contra-
 ceptive use in the medium-term.
 We found that 13% of the control sample reported
 initiating LARC in the short-term time-point, while
 27% of the control group reported initiating by the
 medium-term time-point (bottom rows of panels A
 and B of table 3). We did not see evidence of statisti-
 cally significant impacts of any of the interventions in
 terms of short-term use of LARC. We found that the
 standard voucher combined with SMS increased the
 likelihood of taking up LARC in the medium term by
 20 pp compared with the control group (95% CI 0 pp
 to 41 pp), though the estimated CI is imprecise. None
 of the other treatment arms statistically significantly
 increased the likelihood of modern contraceptive use,
 or LARC methods in the medium term.
 We see that across most models, estimated treatment
 effects for arms assigned to receive SMS were higher
 than those not receiving SMS. Figure 1 presents a forest
 plot demonstrating relationships between pooled
 treatments and individual characteristics and take-up
 of modern methods in the medium-term. We did not
 see evidence that those receiving vouchers were more
 likely to report using contraception in the medium
 term than those who did not. Individuals assigned to
 receive any SMS were 19 pp more likely to report using
 contraception in the medium term than those who did
 not (95% CI 4 pp to 33 pp). We found that individ-
 uals who report an intention to start family planning in
 the short term were 16 pp more likely to report using
 family planning in the medium term (95% CI 7 pp to
 26 pp) and that individuals who were pregnant for the
 first time at baseline were 10 pp less likely to report
 contraceptive use (95% CI −20 pp to −0.3 pp). Partic-
 ipant’s education and delivery in a study facility were
 not associated with self-reported take-up of modern
 methods.
 We consider the impact of treatments on receiving
 a modern contraceptive method from the study clinic
 using data from administrative records in table 4. Thir-
 teen per cent of study participants in the control group
 had received a modern method by the short-term
 follow-up window and 21% had received a modern
 method by the medium-term follow-up window.
 Though treatments combining vouchers with SMS tend
 to have higher estimated probabilities of receiving a
 modern method and the estimated impact is largest
 in the standard voucher with SMS arm, the CIs were
 imprecise and estimated impacts were not statistically
 significantly different from the control groups.
 We conducted sensitivity analyses in online supple-
 mentary table S5 (results with primary outcomes
 separated by phase), online supplementary table S6
 (results with outcomes from administrative data sepa-
 rated by phase), online supplementary table S7 (results
 including LAM) and S8 (with multiple imputation
 for missing outcome). We observed similar patterns
 of results across these sensitivity analyses, though esti-
 mated effects using multiple imputation were quite
 imprecise. We present a comparison of self-reported
 and administrative data outcomes in online supple-
 mentary table S9. In online supplementary table S10,

<section> Discussion
 
<section> We found that that the combination of free contra-
 ception and an SMS reminder increased take-up of
 modern contraceptive methods in the postpartum
 period. There are a number of reasons why combining
 a voucher for free contraception with an SMS reminder
 may have increased take-up. It may be because the
 combination of the voucher and SMS addressed both
 cost and behavioural barriers to take-up. The likeli-
 hood of redeeming the voucher for free contraception
 was higher among participants who used a long-acting
 reversible method compared with other methods,
 suggesting that the voucher may have been especially
 helpful among women interested in using LARC.
 This could be because LARC methods typically come
 at higher out-of-pocket cost and are not always avail-
 able in public facilities without trained providers.
 It could also be the case that, in addition to relaxing
 cost constraints, the voucher increased the salience of
 the need for postpartum family planning, in particular
 when combined with the reminder that draws attention
 to the voucher. Unfortunately, our data did not allow us
 to identify the precise mechanism by which the combi-
 nation of vouchers and SMS reminders increased take-
 up.
 In our study, the provision of a voucher for free
 contraception alone was not sufficient to increase
 take-up of modern methods. While the majority
 of our sample was using a modern method by the
 medium-term time-point, overall redemption rates
 of the voucher were low (20%), and the estimated
 impacts of treatments on acquiring contraception
 in the study clinics were small and statistically insig-
 nificant. The limited use of vouchers in our study is
 consistent with findings from other evaluations of
 voucher programme. 17 This may be because women
 can receive contraception from a variety of locations,
 including private facilities, retail outlets and public
 facilities (where Kenya’s national policy is to provide
 postpartum contraception for free). Some women
 may decide to receive postpartum contraception in
 the facility where they delivered their baby or where
 they take their child for immunisation. Indeed, nearly
 two-thirds of those who ever report use of a modern
 method received their first postpartum modern
 method from a location other than the study facility
 where they enrolled during ANC.

 We also found that those who received SMS reminders
 were more likely to take-up modern methods in the
 medium-term than those who did not. It is somewhat
 surprising that the SMS reminder seems to have had
 more influence in the medium term than it does in the
 short term (immediately after messages were sent). It
 may be that the SMS reminder increased the salience
 of desires around birth spacing and postpartum family
 planning but participants were not immediately able
 to act that the response was not immediate due to the
 need to confer with partners, develop a plan for visiting
 a facility or other factors.
 Our evidence also suggests that not all behavioural
 nudges are effective in increasing postpartum contra-
 ceptive take-up. We find limited evidence that incorpo-
 rating a deadline to use the voucher drives either early
 or eventual take-up of modern postpartum contracep-
 tive methods. While our deadline was chosen to occur
 after the recommended initiation timing of postpartum
 contraception at 6 weeks by the WHO, it may nonetheless
 have been sent earlier than many women were ready to
 consider modern methods, particularly LARC methods.
 Reminders offer greater flexibility than a strict dead-
 line, 35 and this flexibility may be especially appropriate
 in the context of the many demands of the postpartum
 period.
 Our experiment has important limitations. This was
 a pilot study with a modest sample size that was further
 limited by attrition. Attrition in this study was driven by
 the highly mobile nature of this urban population and
 the fact that we were attempting to contact women at a
 time when they were caring for a new baby. We demon-
 strated that demographic characteristics of the sample
 we were able to follow were not significantly different
 from the enrolled sample and that our findings were
 qualitatively similar when we use multiple imputation
 to infer missing outcome data. Another limitation of
 our study is that we relied on self-report of take-up and
 timing of postpartum contraceptive use for our primary
 outcome. As self-reports of contraceptive use are
 costly and onerous to verify, there is limited rigorous
 evidence of the validity of self-reported contraceptive
 use. 36 In our study, we generally see consistency across
 self-report outcomes and outcomes from administra-
 tive data. We surveyed new mothers at high frequency
 in the postpartum period in order to avoid relying on
 long recall periods to reconstruct the timing of their
 use of postpartum family planning. While social desir-
 ability bias is a significant problem in many studies of
 contraceptive take-up that rely on self-reports, 37 74%
 of participants in our study report at baseline that they
 plan to use family planning at some point in the post-
 partum period, suggesting high acceptability of post-
 partum contraception in this population.
 Finally, our study sample draws only from women
 who have attended ANC in two private maternity facil-
 ities located in the informal settlements of Nairobi
 who have access to a cell phone. An estimated 84% of
 adults living in Nairobi own a cell phone, suggesting
 that we are unlikely to exclude a significant portion 
<section> of our sample based on access to a cell phone within
 their household. 38 Within our selected sample, we find
 similar but slightly higher rates of postpartum contra-
 ceptive use compared with a previous study in Nairobi’s
 
<section> informal settlements.
 
<section> International efforts to increase access to postpartum
 contraception have focused on designing voucher
 programmes that decrease or remove the cost of modern
 contraceptive methods to users. Evidence that a voucher
 for free contraception is not enough to increase take-up,
 but a free voucher combined with a simple reminder can
 significantly increase take-up of modern contraception
 has implications for the design of voucher and transfer
 programme. Voucher programmes should consider how
 to design financial supports in a way that accounts for
 potential behavioural frictions in the postpartum period.
 There is relatively little prior evidence on the impact of
 reminders on contraceptive take-up in general and in the
 postpartum period in particular. 40 Our study provides some
 of the first evidence from a randomised controlled trial to
 evaluate the impact of SMS reminders on contraceptive
 use. Our evidence fills an important gap in the literature
 on delivery strategies for promoting postpartum family
 planning in sub-Saharan Africa. 41 Furthermore, we provide
 evidence on strategies to improve utilisation of postpartum
 contraception among a population of urban poor, helping
 to close the gap in knowledge, improving contraceptive
 take-up across socioeconomics groups 42 and ensuring
 
<section> equity of access to modern contraception.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> Despite significant health risks to mother and baby of
 closely spaced births and substantial desire to improve
 birth-spacing, take-up of modern contraceptive methods
 remains low in the postpartum period. We find that
 combining a behavioural nudge (an SMS reminder) with
 a voucher for free postpartum contraception increases
 the take-up of modern methods. Our study highlights
 the need for policy makers to consider multiple different
 kinds of barriers to the take-up of contraceptive methods
 
<section> in the postpartum period.
