 tain parts of the world seem to be at increased risk,
 with multi-country studies documenting the highest
 rates in Africa (Akmatov, 2011; Stoltenborgh et al.
 
<section> 2011). Rates of family conﬂict, abuse, and a range of
 poor developmental outcomes seem to be even higher
 in post-conﬂict settings where children and families are
 faced with exposure to community-based violence and
 other risk factors for family stress and mental health

 re-use, distribution, and reproduction in 
<section> problems, including poverty, displacement, loss of or
 separation from loved ones, and uncertainty about
 the future (Mels et al. 2010; Reed et al. 2012). Daily
 stressors experienced in post-conﬂict settings may
 have as much, or potentially more, eﬀects on mental
 health as war-related stress. Some ﬁndings suggest
 that family violence is a major predictor of mental
 health outcomes (Miller & Rasmussen, 2010; Panter-
 Brick et al. 2011), perhaps even more predictive of chil-
 dren’s mental health problems than exposure to war
 violence among children (Miller & Rasmussen, 2010).
 Thus targeting a broader range of stressors, including
 mental health and family well-being, may buﬀer the
 harmful eﬀects of conﬂict (Bolton & Betancourt, 2004;
 Akinsulure-Smith & Smith, 2012).
 Child abuse has been associated with lasting
 emotional, behavioral, physical, and cognitive prob-
 lems (Moylan et al. 2010; Mills et al. 2011; Widom
 et al. 2012). Overly harsh and inconsistent parenting,
 with or without abusive behavior, are also associated
 with lower self-esteem and social skills, as well as
 higher rates of anxiety and disruptive behavior
 (Boudreault-Bouchard et al. 2013; Yap et al. 2013; Uji
 et al. 2014). In post-conﬂict settings, harsh parenting
 may even moderate the eﬀects of exposure to war on
 children’s mental health (Catani et al. 2008; Miller &
 Rasmussen, 2010). Parents who mistreat their children
 typically demonstrate limited positive interactions
 with their child, poor understanding of child develop-
 ment, low tolerance of misbehavior, and ineﬀective
 discipline strategies. Behavioral parenting programs
 address these risk factors by increasing skills for posi-
 tive parent–child interactions and eﬀective discipline
 and by providing parents with education on child de-
 velopment and behavior (Kaminski et al. 2008).
 Parenting interventions that address abuse and
 evidence-based child and family psychosocial inter-
 ventions in general, are scarce or non-existent in
 many low-income countries and particularly in con-
 ﬂict-aﬀected settings (Kakuma et al. 2011; Kieling
 et al. 2011). The most commonly available services pro-
 vide general psychosocial support, often using
 approaches that have not been empirically validated
 or grounded in evidence-based practices (Tol et al.
 
<section> 2011). Prevention and early interventions are needed
 at the family and community levels to reduce abuse
 and foster positive parenting practices – protective fac-
 tors that can buﬀer against mental health problems and
 other negative developmental outcomes (Engle et al.
 
<section> 2007; Betancourt & Khan, 2008; Kieling et al. 2011).
 
<section> Behavioral parenting interventions
 
<section> Empirical evidence suggests that behavioral parent
 training programs can improve a range of positive
 caregiver and child outcomes, including child interna-
 lizing and externalizing symptoms, parent-child at-
 tachment, parenting stress, and parental self-eﬃcacy
 (Eisenstadt et al. 1993; Chase & Eyberg, 2008; Eyberg
 et al. 2008). These programs are grounded in behavioral
 theory; parents are taught to use positive reinforce-
 ment strategies, such as praise, to increase appropriate
 child behaviors and consistent, non-corporal discipline
 strategies. The goal is to provide parents with concrete
 techniques to decrease harsh parenting, improve
 interactions, encourage child prosocial behavior, and
 promote positive child development. Among interven-
 tions backed by the strongest evidence for use with
 young children are Triple P (Nowak & Heinrichs,
 2008), Parent–Child Interaction Therapy (Eisenstadt
 et al. 1993), Incredible Years (Webster-Stratton et al.
 
<section> 2011), and the Nurturing Parenting Program (Maher
 et al. 2011). The magnitude of eﬀects across these varies
 based on the target population and version of the pro-
 gram. While all primarily behavioral, these programs
 have unique elements in content and delivery. For de-
 livery, they each require diﬀerent combinations of
 inputs, such as varying training models, facilitator
 requirements, or materials; this inﬂuences the settings
 for which they are appropriate and the degree to
 which adaptations to implementation plans are
 required across contexts.
 Most of the research supporting parent training
 programs has been in high-income countries. Of the
 limited studies in low-income countries, few have tar-
 geted reductions in harsh parenting or prevention of
 emotional and behavioral problems (Klein & Rye,
 
<section> 2004; Jin et al. 2007; Oveisi et al. 2010; Mejia et al.
 
<section> 2012), while more have focused on caregivers of infants
 and children under age 3 and outcomes related to early
 mother–child interactions (Knerr et al. 2013). Further
 research is needed to establish the feasibility and eﬃ-
 cacy of such interventions in low income, conﬂict-
 aﬀected settings and to determine the best strategies
 for implementation and wide-scale dissemination.
 
<section> Current study
 
<section> We add to the growing evidence based on parenting
 interventions designed for low-resource settings by
 conducting a randomized trial of a 10-session program
 for caregivers of young children in post-conﬂict Liberia
 called ‘Parents Make the Diﬀerence’ (PMD). PMD was
 developed for caregivers of children aged 3–7 years.
 The program is grounded in behavioral theory and
 shares core concepts with parenting programs backed
 by the strongest evidence from high-income countries.
 The content was designed to be culturally relevant and
 appropriate for lay providers to deliver. We hypothe-
 sized that the program would be feasible with limited 
<section> resources, reduce harsh discipline, increase positive
 parenting, and improve caregiver–child interactions.
 Secondary outcomes related to child cognition,
 emotional and behavioral well-being, and caregiver-
 child communication. Another program objective was
 to promote malaria prevention behaviors, particularly
 caregivers using bednets for their children, as malaria
 continues to be a leading cause of child morbidity
 and mortality (National Malaria Control Program
 et al. 2012).
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Setting and participants
 
<section> This study was conducted in Lofa County, Liberia.
 During the Second Liberian Civil War (1999–2003) that
 killed between 150,000 and 200,000 people, many resi-
 dents of this county ﬂed to neighboring Guinea and
 Sierra Leone. The International Rescue Committee
 (IRC), an international humanitarian organization,
 implemented the PMD program approximately
 years after refugees returned home to rural Lofa County.
 The IRC recruited caregivers from ﬁve communities
 in Lofa. Program staﬀ conducted information sessions
 at schools and invited families to register. To be eli-
 gible, adults had to be a caregiver to a child aged 3–7
 years entering the ﬁrst year of formal schooling. If a
 caregiver had more than one eligible child, staﬀ enum-
 erated all eligible children in the household and ran-
 domly selected a ‘target’ child.
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> PMD is a 10-session intervention. IRC staﬀ developed
 the program by reviewing existing evidence-based pro-
 gramming and soliciting feedback from content
 experts on the research team; an earlier iteration of
 the program was inﬂuenced in particular by concepts
 included in the Nurturing Parenting Program
 (Bavolek et al. 1983). The local IRC oﬃce then held
 focus groups in all ﬁve communities with male and fe-
 male caregivers, as well as activity-based groups with
 children, to gather information about common parent-
 ing practices and roles, including those related to edu-
 cation and health. To inform components of the
 intervention on harsh parenting, additional conversa-
 tions with caregivers and community leaders were
 held to gather information on speciﬁc discipline prac-
 tices. These data informed both the intervention and
 assessment tools.
 A pair of lay Liberian facilitators was trained to lead
 each weekly 2-hour session with groups of 20–35 care-
 givers. This group size is larger than that of many
 other parenting programs but allowed the IRC to
 serve more people with fewer resources; this is
 important for scalability in low-resource settings with-
 out external funding. This group size also had proven
 feasible and acceptable in previous piloting of similar
 interventions by IRC. Sessions were highly interactive
 with an emphasis on discussion, modeling, and
 in-session skills practice. The program focused on posi-
 tive parenting and included briefer components on
 building cognitive and educational skills and malaria
 prevention behaviors (see Table 1). Facilitators visited
 the home of each caregiver once during the program
 to reinforce skills. The IRC provided caregivers with
 an incentive of approximately $1.50 USD per session
 as is customary of programs oﬀered by non-
 governmental organizations in this setting. Caregivers
 were permitted to attend the program with a spouse or
 co-caregiver.
 
<section> Research design
 
<section> This was a pragmatic, parallel-group, individually-
 randomized superiority trial. Eligible primary care-
 givers were randomized into a treatment or wait-list
 control group with a 1:1 allocation to treatment ratio,
 stratiﬁed by community. A participant ﬂow diagram
 is displayed in Fig. 1. With power of 0.80, α of 0.05,
 equal allocation of participants to treatment and
 control conditions, and an assumption of minimal at-
 trition, this study was designed to detect a standar-
 dized eﬀect of at least 0.30.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> A team of trained Liberian enumerators conducted a
 baseline survey of caregivers and target children in
 September 2013. After the survey, we held a public lot-
 tery in each community and randomly assigned eli-
 gible caregivers (without replacement) to immediate
 or delayed treatment. IRC staﬀ delivered the 10-session
 intervention to caregivers in the immediate treatment
 group over the course of 13 weeks in early 2013.
 Approximately 1 month after the ﬁnal session, we sur-
 veyed caregivers in both groups prior to providing the
 intervention to the waitlist control group. Enumerators
 administered all surveys at participants’ homes and
 captured responses with Android smart-phones.
 During the same home visit, enumerators also asked
 caregivers and their children to play together for
 min to complete an observational measure of parent–
 child interactions. Enumerators were blinded to treat-
 ment assignment unless the caregiver divulged this
 information.
 The research protocol was reviewed and approved
 by local community advisory boards in Liberia from
 all communities and the Duke University Institutional
 Review Board. This study was pre-registered at Clini-
 calTrials.gov (registration number omitted).

<section> and
 
<section> Measures
 
<section> Prior to data collection, the local research team evalu-
 ated the study instruments through systematic piloting
 and cognitive interviewing. To do this, the local re-
 search team administered the items to caregivers and
 children in the community and asked participants to
 explain their responses to assess understandability
 and to advise on clearer ways to ask or translate the
 items. This led to changes in the core content of the
 questions, as well as to changes in the translations
 from American to Liberian English.
 
<section> Primary outcomes
 
<section> Parenting behavior
 
<section> We asked caregivers to self-report on their use of six
 harsh discipline practices – such as whipping, slap-
 ping, and yelling at the child – in the 4 weeks prior
 to the survey on a scale of 0 (‘never’) to 4 (‘almost

<section> designed to be highly interactive with a strong emphasis on
 every day’). Items were adapted from the Discipline
 Module of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey
 (UNICEF, 2005). Responses were averaged to create a
 composite index. We also asked caregivers to rate
 their use of four positive behavior management strate-
 gies: ‘time out’, teaching rules, praising compliant
 behavior, and asking the child to stop bad behavior.
 The ‘praise’ item was rated on a diﬀerent 0–3 scale,
 so all positive behavior management items were stan-
 dardized before summing to create a composite that
 was then standardized. Caregivers also provided an
 open-ended description of their response the last
 time the child misbehaved. Enumerators coded
 responses to match 15 possible behaviors; non-
 matching responses were coded as ‘other’.
 
<section> Caregiver–child interactions
 
<section> We asked caregivers and children to rate their experi-
 ence of four behaviors: spending time together, 
<insert> Fig. 1. Participant ﬂow diagram. 
<iend>

 playing together, talking together, and praise.
 Caregivers rated their tendency to do these behaviors
 by indicating their position on a 10-step ladder
 where the 10th step represents maximum engagement.
 Children were asked whether the caregiver did these
 things in the 7 days prior to the survey. To reduce dif-
 ﬁculty, enumerators ﬁrst asked about the behavior
 using simpliﬁed wording and phrasing in the form of
 a ‘yes/no’ question. If the child responded ‘yes’, the
 enumerator then asked how much: ‘a small amount’
 
<section> (1), ‘a medium amount’ (2), or ‘a lot’ (3). ‘No’ responses
 were scored as 0. We created composite scores for care-
 givers and children by averaging responses to each set
 of items.
 
<section> Secondary outcomes
 
<section> Communication
 
<section> Audio recordings from the 5 min caregiver-child play
 observation were transcribed by Liberians and coded
 by trained assistants (American) using the Dyadic
 Parent–Child Interaction Coding System (DPICS-III;
 Eyberg et al. 2005). DPICS allows for the classiﬁcation
 of parent verbalizations that serve as markers of
 parent-child relationship quality. Speciﬁc categories
 include: neutral talk, praise, reﬂection, behavior
 description, questions, commands, and negative talk.
 Assistants were trained according to the DPICS
 clinical coding manual (Chase & Eyberg, 2005;
 Fernandez et al. 2005) and reached 80% agreement
 with the trainer before coding independently; 10% of
 all transcripts were randomly selected to be re-coded
 by a second rater.
 
<section> Child cognitive abilities
 
<section> We developed a short battery of cognitive tasks
 similar to those on standardized developmental and
 cognitive measures. Domains included receptive lan-
 guage, expressive language, verbal comprehension,
 verbal ﬂuency, and numeracy. Scores on language
 domains were standardized and summed to create
 an overall language ability composite that was then
 standardized.
 
<section> Child wellbeing
 
<section> The Strengths and Diﬃculties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a
 25-item behavioral screening questionnaire about chil-
 dren 3–17 years old (Goodman, 1997). We adminis-
 tered three subscales of the SDQ to caregivers:
 hyperactivity/inattention, emotional symptoms, and
 conduct problems.
 
<section> Malaria prevention behaviors
 
<section> We also asked caregivers whether the household
 owned a mosquito net, whether the target child slept
 under the net the night before the survey, and other
 patterns of use.
 
<section> Empirical strategy
 
<section> We calculated intention-to-treat (ITT) estimates of the
 average treatment eﬀect, θ ITT , using the following ordi-
 nary least squares speciﬁcation:

<iend>

 measured 1 month after the treatment group com-
 pleted the program; T i is an indicator for assignment
 to treatment (1 = treatment; 0 = wait-list control); X i is
 a vector of community strata dummies and baseline
 covariates. In the main speciﬁcation, all missing data
 were imputed with median values.
 In addition to looking at the average treatment
 eﬀects, we also examined treatment heterogeneity via
 subgroup analyses (Longford, 1999) and quantile
 regression (Koenker, 2005). Subgroup (moderator)
 analyses allow us to ask whether the treatment was
 more or less eﬀective for some participants. We esti-
 mated treatment heterogeneity by interacting assign-
 ment to treatment with each baseline covariate we
 are testing as a potential moderator. Quantile re-
 gression allows us to examine the variation in impact
 across the distribution of outcomes. We did not pre-
 register heterogeneity analyses, so these results should
 be viewed as exploratory; however, our selection of
 potential moderators was guided by similar work
 (Gardner et al. 2010).
 To explore the mechanisms through which the
 intervention might impact more distal outcomes
 (e.g. child emotional symptoms), we considered
 two possible post-baseline mediator (or intervening)
 variables: caregiver-reported use of harsh discipline
 and caregiver–child positive interactions. We tested
 a multiple mediator model that includes both
 potential mediators simultaneously and compute
 bootstrapped 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI)
 (adjusted bootstrap percentile method) of the total
 indirect eﬀect and the component indirect eﬀects
 of each proposed mediator (Preacher & Hayes,
 2008).
 We conducted all analyses in R version 3.0.2 (R Core
 Team, 2013) except for the quantile regressions which
 we conducted in Stata MP version 12.0 (StataCorp,
 2011). Our paper was compiled directly from the raw
 data and analysis code using RStudio version
 0.98.932 (RStudio, 2013) and LATEX MacTeX-2013 dis-
 tribution (LaTeX3 Project, 2013).
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Participant characteristics
 
<section> Children (n = 269) and their caregivers (n = 270) com-
 pleted a baseline survey. Figure 1 displays the partici-
 pant ﬂow diagram. 53% of the child sample was
 female, and the average child was 5.2 years old. The
 caregiver sample was also almost evenly divided be-
 tween males and females (57%), and the average care-
 giver was 35.5 years old. Table 2 demonstrates that the
 random assignment to treatment and wait-list control
 resulted in pre-treatment balance.
 
<section> Treatment compliance
 
<section> Caregiver attendance was high; at least one caregiver
 from 98% of households attended all 10 sessions.
 In some cases, a co-caregiver who did not participate
 in the surveys attended sessions with, or in place
 of, the caregiver in the study. These patterns of attend-
 ance were not tracked, nor were completed home
 visits.

 whipping, slapping, beating, and shouting at their
 children. The standardized treatment eﬀects (Glass’s
 Delta) on harsh parenting practices range from −0.26
 to −0.67. We also observe a corresponding signiﬁcant
 increase in the use of positive behavior management
 strategies. This small eﬀect appears to be driven by a
 signiﬁcant increase in reported use of time out.
 We see the same pattern of results in the open cod-
 ing of caregivers’ descriptions of how they responded
 to their child’s most recent episode of bad behavior 
<section> (see Table A.3 in the Online Appendix). On average, a
 smaller proportion of caregivers in the treatment group
 described using harsh practices such as yelling and
 beating, and a larger proportion reported using time
 out.
 
<section> Caregiver–child interactions
 
<section> In addition to decreasing caregivers’ use of harsh pun-
 ishment and increasing the use of positive behavior
 management strategies, the program also signiﬁcantly
 increased positive interactions between caregivers and
 children. The average caregiver in the treatment group
 reported a 4.4% increase in positive interactions (0.34
 points on a scale of 1–10), while the average child of
 a caregiver assigned to the treatment group reported
 a 17.5% increase (0.32 points on a scale of 0–3; standar-
 dized eﬀect sizes of 0.22 and 0.38, respectively).
 
<section> Secondary outcomes
 
<section> The average caregiver assigned to the treatment group
 increased praise and decreased negative talk as a per-
 centage of overall number of caregiver verbalizations
 during the timed observational play session, but
 neither eﬀect is statistically signiﬁcant at conventional
 levels. Counter to what we hypothesized, we observe
 a slight decrease in verbalizations among children of
 caregivers assigned to the treatment group, but this ef-
 fect is also not statistically signiﬁcant. We detect a
 small treatment eﬀect at the 0.10 level on children’s re-
 ceptive vocabulary and numeracy (standardized eﬀect
 sizes of 0.1 and 0.18, respectively). With the exception
 of caregiver-reported child conduct problems, child
 cognitive, and emotional wellbeing indicators move
 in the hypothesized direction; however, these eﬀects
 are mostly small and non-signiﬁcant. The program
 had no measurable impact on the uptake of malaria
 prevention behaviors.
 
<section> Sensitivity
 
<section> Bias could potentially result from unobserved baseline
 imbalance and systematic attrition, so we tested the
 sensitivity of impacts on primary outcomes. As
 shown in Table A.8 of the Online Appendix, ﬁndings
 are robust to an alternate speciﬁcation that excludes
 baseline covariates. We also created an extreme
 bound on treatment eﬀects that assumes the ‘worst’
 case for missing treatment observations and the ‘best’
 case for missing control observations (see table notes
 for more details). The impact on harsh parenting
 holds under this extreme assumption, but the impacts
 on caregiver–child positive interactions and positive
 behavior management shrink and become non-
 signiﬁcant.
 
<section> Treatment heterogeneity
 
<section> We examine treatment heterogeneity in three outcomes
 
<section> – harsh parenting, positive behavior management, and
 positive interaction – according to four characteristics
 measured at baseline: caregiver gender, child gender,
 child age, and child conduct problems. Results are pre-
 sented in Table 4.
 With respect to harsh parenting, female caregivers
 report signiﬁcantly greater use of harsh punishments,
 but beneﬁtted twice as much from the intervention
 compared with male caregivers. Caregivers of boys
 also reported signiﬁcantly greater use of harsh punish-
 ment, but child gender was not a signiﬁcant moderator
 of treatment impact. Child age, however, was a moder-
 ator, with caregivers of younger children beneﬁtting
 more from the intervention. There is also evidence
 that caregivers of children with more conduct prob-
 lems at baseline responded more positively. With
 respect to positive behavior management and chil-
 dren’s reports of positive interactions, there was only
 possible moderation (p < 0.10) of caregiver gender on
 eﬀects on positive behavior management with males
 showing larger improvements.
 Quantile regression results are displayed in Fig. A.1
 in the Online Appendix. As shown in Panel B, it
 appears that the intervention was most eﬀective
 among caregivers who reported the most frequent
 use of harsh punishment (−1.31 S D
 
<section> Mediation analysis
 
<section> The intervention’s theory of change suggests that
 teaching caregivers the importance of positive
 caregiver–child interaction, the ineﬀectiveness and
 potential negative impact of harsh discipline strategies,
 and the utility of positive behavior management
 approaches – all in the context of modeling and
 practice – will lead to measureable change on these
 intermediate caregiver/relationship outcomes, which
 in turn will improve child outcomes. As reported
 above, we observe statistically signiﬁcant impacts on
 the intermediate outcomes, but small and generally
 non-signiﬁcant results for child outcomes such as con-
 duct problems, language ability, and emotional symp-
 toms. While the program impact was non-signiﬁcant,
 we can use mediation analysis to explore the mechan-
 ism through which the program may impact child out-
 comes (O’Rourke & MacKinnon, 2015).
 As shown in Fig. A.2 in the Online Appendix, child
 emotional problems appear to be partially mediated by
 harsh discipline and positive caregiver–child interac-
 tions. The total indirect eﬀect is −0.13 S D and the
 95% CI excludes 0. Both mediators appear to contrib-
 ute roughly the same amount to the indirect eﬀect.
 There is also a signiﬁcant indirect eﬀect of these two

<section> Discussion
 
<section> This randomized trial examined the feasibility and im-
 pact of a parenting skills intervention for caregivers of
 young children in Liberia. Findings add to the scarce
 but growing literature on the impacts of parenting
 interventions in low-income countries and post-conﬂict
 settings. This study focuses on children ages 3–7, an
 age range well-represented in parenting literature in
 high-income countries but less so in other parts of
 the world.
 Results show that the PMD reduced caregivers’ use
 of harsh physical and verbal punishment strategies and
 increased their use of positive behavior management
 at 1-month follow-up. The program also improved
 caregiver–child interactions – according to caregiver
 and child report – but no signiﬁcant eﬀects were
 found on child-level outcomes or malaria prevention
 behaviors.
 
<section> The eﬀects of PMD on harsh punishment were the
 most robust ﬁndings, with medium-sized eﬀects on
 common discipline strategies, including beating, whip-
 ping, and shouting. This is comparable with eﬀects of
 similar programs in the USA. In their review of parent-
 ing interventions in low- and middle-income countries,
 Knerr et al. (2013) identiﬁed three studies speciﬁcally
 targeting reductions in harsh parenting behaviors. As
 examples, results were consistent with those of
 Oveisi et al. (2010) who documented moderate eﬀects
 on harsh discipline following a physician-led parenting
 intervention in Iran and larger than the small long-
 term eﬀect on harsh discipline among Turkish mothers
 after an early enrichment program Kagitcibasi et al.
 
<section> (2001). Thus, our results suggest that a parenting inter-
 vention delivered by lay facilitators in a post-conﬂict
 setting can be as eﬀective for reducing harsh discipline
 as many similar programs in other contexts.
 PMD also had signiﬁcant small eﬀects on positive
 behavior management strategies, such as praising posi-
 tive behavior and using time out. These were smaller
 than eﬀects of parenting interventions in high-income
 countries, though studies reporting the largest eﬀects
 evaluated interventions for children with documented 
<section> disruptive behavior problems (Thomas & Zimmer-
 Gembeck, 2007). Thus, the small impact of PMD on
 positive behavior management could reﬂect the fact
 that we studied the impact of a smaller intervention
 dose on a non-clinical sample. To bolster eﬀects, inter-
 ventions like PMD may need to include more intense
 skills modeling and practice, focus on fewer skills,
 and take into account more of the potential environ-
 mental or cultural factors that may point to additional
 helpful adaptations.
 For positive parent–child interactions, such as play-
 ing, talking, and time together, PMD led to modest
 improvements. This is consistent with the study by
 Kagitcibasi et al. (2001) in Turkey documenting small
 but signiﬁcant eﬀects of a parenting intervention on
 mother involvement and parent-child communication.
 Several studies in low-income countries also have
 documented beneﬁts of parenting interventions on
 positive caregiver–infant interactions (Aboud et al.
 
<section> 2009; Knerr et al. 2013).
 Despite having a positive impact on these proximal
 caregiver-level outcomes, the PMD program did not
 lead to signiﬁcant improvements on the secondary out-
 comes of children’s cognitive and communication skills
 or emotional or behavioral well-being. This is not en-
 tirely surprising given the non-clinical sample, as higher
 levels of distress and emotional dysregulation among
 oppositional children at baseline predict greater
 improvements in child outcomes after parent training
 (Scott & O’Connor, 2012). These studies have led to
 the ‘diﬀerential susceptibility hypothesis’, which posits
 that children with higher levels of irritability and
 emotional lability are more impacted by changes in par-
 enting (Bakermans-Kranenburg et al. 2008; Scott &
 O’Connor, 2012). Thus, while the theory underlying
 parenting interventions is that changes in parenting
 will positively impact children’s development, in non-
 clinical samples, parenting changes may not have im-
 mediate eﬀects; child outcomes may emerge over time
 
<section> – especially the prevention of negative mental health
 outcomes (Hermanns et al. 2013). If child-level eﬀects
 are to emerge over time, the mechanism of change
 might be through decreased harsh parenting and
 increased positive caregiver–child interactions. The
 results of our mediation analysis suggest that both
 might mediate child emotional problems. More positive
 interactions may also mediate the development of chil-
 dren’s cognitive abilities, such as language.
 Finally, a foundational goal of this study was to de-
 termine the feasibility of implementing a parenting
 skills intervention in a post-conﬂict, low-resource set-
 ting. Attendance and monitoring data supported
 both the feasibility and acceptability across the com-
 munities. This is encouraging because the intervention
 was implemented in community settings by lay
 facilitators – a delivery model that is replicable across
 diverse settings, including those aﬀected by conﬂict
 and scarcity of health professionals.
 
<section> Limitations
 
<section> Limitations are related to measurement challenges,
 length of follow-up, study design, and implemen-
 tation. First, the broad age range in child age (3–7
 years) meant that we could not rely on standardized
 cognitive measures, and the study was not powered
 to examine outcomes by age group. This study was
 also among the ﬁrst to use an observational measure
 of parent–child interactions in this context. American
 research assistants coded the data, and their unfami-
 liarity with Liberian English vernacular may have con-
 tributed to the limited results in this domain. Second,
 endline measurement 1-month post-intervention may
 not have allowed suﬃcient time for potential positive
 child outcomes to emerge and did not allow for exam-
 ination of the maintenance of change over time. Third,
 related to design, it is possible that there was contami-
 nation between the groups, which could have attenu-
 ated the observed treatment eﬀects. Also, because we
 used a waitlist control condition, we do not have a
 time and attention control condition to conclude that
 eﬀects were due to this speciﬁc intervention. Lastly, at-
 tendance tracking did not specify whether another
 family member replaced the enrolled participant at
 any given session, meaning that attendance rates are
 at the household level.
 
<section> Conclusions and future directions
 
<section> Results support the feasibility of implementing PMD in
 a low-income post-conﬂict setting to reduce harsh
 treatment of children. PMD was implemented in
 community-based settings with lay facilitators, a
 model that could be replicated by aid organizations,
 governments, or community-level mechanisms.
 Future implementations of PMD or similar programs
 should evaluate modiﬁcations that may further in-
 crease impact. Live practice with children has emerged
 as one of the most eﬀective treatment components
 for children with disruptive behavior disorders
 (Kaminski et al. 2008) and could also enhance out-
 comes in non-clinical populations. This could be inte-
 grated into PMD home visits. However, as home
 visits are a relatively expensive component, their
 contribution to the intervention eﬀects and cost-
 eﬀectiveness would need to be explored.
 Given the null results on malaria prevention and
 cognitive outcomes, it is clear that more work is
 needed to determine whether and how to integrate
 parenting, health, and early education interventions.
 These are key outcomes for young children, and all 
<section> are caregiver-driven. The challenge is to develop inter-
 ventions that have enough depth, while also maintain-
 ing a reasonable scope and length.
 A priority for future study is to evaluate the long-
 term eﬀects of prevention-focused parenting interven-
 tions to determine whether they inﬂuence the future
 development of emotional, behavioral, or cognitive
 problems throughout childhood and adolescence.
 Future studies also should examine impacts of PMD
 with caregivers of children with clinical levels of beha-
 vioral or emotional diﬃculties. These could compare
 eﬀects of the intervention for clinical v. non-clinical
 samples or compare variants of the program for chil-
 dren and caregivers with varying levels of concerns.
