<section> Abstract
 
<section> Background and Objective: The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a series of physical, mental, and behavioral
 symptoms with various severities, and disturbs social and personal relationships. The syndrome appears during
 luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and is a common disorder of reproductive age. Different treatments have been
 introduced for the syndrome due to its unknown complicated causes. Vitamin B1 (Thiamin) may reduce
 symptoms of the syndrome through affecting the performance of coenzymes in the metabolism of carbohydrates
 and main branch of amino acid that plays an important role in appearance of physical and mental symptoms of
 the PMS. Vitamin B1 is the first water-soluble discovered vitamin. As it is effective in neural activity and muscle
 tonus in different body activities, including hematopoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, activities of the central
 nervous system and neuromuscular system, etc., it can be effective in this dysmenorrhea that is a disorder
 resulting from uterine muscular contraction. There are no enough studies and research on the effect of vitamin
 B1 on the symptoms of PMS, therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of vitamin B1 on the
 symptoms of PMS in students residing at dormitories of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences in 2013.
 
<section> Methods: In this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 80 students with PMS residing at dormitories of
 Jahrom University of Medical Sciences were divided randomly into two groups, vitamin B1 and placebo. The
 severity of the symptoms of PMS in two cycles, before the intervention and during the intervention, was
 recorded by the students. The data were collected using an information collection form, PMS provisional
 diagnosis form, daily status record form, Beck Depression Inventory. The data were analyzed using descriptive
 and inferential statistics.
 
<section> Results: There was no significant difference among the studied variables in terms of confounding variables. The
 comparison of vitamin B1 group before the intervention with that after the intervention showed that vitamin B1
 reduced mean mental (35.08%) and physical (21.2%) symptoms significantly (P < 0.0001). Moreover, there was
 a significant difference between vitamin B1 and placebo groups in terms of mean mental and physical symptoms,
 as mean symptoms in vitamin B1 group was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (P < 0.0001).
 
<section> Conclusion: It seems that vitamin B1 is effective in recovery of mental and physical symptoms of PMS.
 Therefore, this vitamin can be used to reach a major goal of midwifery, that is, reduction of symptom severity of
 PMS, without any side effects.

<section> 1. Introduction
 
<section> The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common disorder in the reproductive age and appears in 85-90% of
 women in the reproductive age with various degrees (Abdollahifard et al., 2013; Bakhshani et al., 2011; Gehlert
 et al., 2009; Pourmohsen et al., 2010). The disorder consists of a series of physical, emotional, and behavioral
 symptoms appearing regularly and periodically in relation to luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in most cycles
 (Gehlert et al., 2009; Abdollahifard et al., 2012). Symptoms of the PMS are as follows: fatigue, irritability,
 edema, anxiety, tension, mastalgia (breast tenderness), mood swings, depression, acne, increased appetite, crying
 for no particular reason, headaches, forgetfulness, gastrointestinal symptoms, poor concentration, flushing,
 flatulence, limb edema, and dizziness (Speroff & Fritz, 2011; Berek, 2011). The disorder may cause marital 
<section> relation disruption, mother-child problems, social isolation, decreased attention, increased psychosomatic
 symptoms, and even suicide and legal problems (Abdollahifard et al., 2013; Braverman, 2007). Although PMS is
 a common condition in the world, it is difficult to measure its actual prevalence rate due to the extensive
 difference among diagnostic criteria and definitions (Speroff & Fritz, 2011). Different studies reported a rate of
 54-90% for the prevalence of PMS (Abdollahifard et al., 2013; Bakhshani et al., 2011; Braverman, 2007). The
 real cause of PMS is almost unknown, and theories in this regard include the increased aldosterone activity,
 elevated adrenal function, hyperprolactinemia, hypoglycemia, decreased levels of central dopamine and
 serotonin, decreased vitamin B6, and decreased essential fatty acids, of which the decreased levels of central
 dopamine and serotonin has been received more attention than other causes (Ghazi-Jahani, 2004; Sina, 1999;
 Ghazi-Jahani, 2007).
 
<section> Many treatment protocols have been suggested because there is no specific pathophysiology for PMS. The
 suggested treatments are as follows: bromocriptine for breast congestion and pain, serotonin reuptake inhibitors
 (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, antiprostaglandin medicines, GnRH analogues, vitamins, and herbal medicine.
 Currently, the most efficient treatment is the use of fluoxetine that has side effects, including insomnia,
 nervousness, and decreased libido (Ghazi-Jahani, 2004; Sina, 1999; Steiner et al., 2006; Ghazi-Jahani, 2007).
 The overall goal of treating PMS is the adequate control of the symptoms in a way that the patient can function
 appropriately in the entire menstrual cycle (Speroff & Fritz, 2011; Kashani, 2010). There is no unique treatment
 for PMS (Braverman, 2007). The treatment approach is that all the patients with PMS should be followed up
 using treatments with least side effects (Baker, 2008). In this regard, treatment methods include medical therapy,
 the use of food supplements and vitamins, surgeries, and complementary alternative medicine (Ernest et al., 2011;
 Kim & Freeman, 2010; Ozgoli et al., 2011).
 
<section> The use of vitamin is one of the most common treatment for every disease because they have fewer side effects
 than other medications, and they are also safe, cost-effective, and accessible. Furthermore, vitamins have been
 recommended as the benefit treatment that is safe, inexpensive, and effective in treatment of PMS (National
 Academy of Sciences, 1998).
 
<section> Vitamin B1 (Thiamin) may reduce symptoms of PMS through the coenzyme functions in the metabolism of
 carbohydrates and main branch of amino acid that plays an important role in appearance of physical and mental
 symptoms of PMS. Vitamin B1 is the first water-soluble discovered vitamin. As it is effective in neural activity
 and muscle tonus in different body activities, including hematopoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, activities of
 the central nervous system and neuromuscular system, etc., it can be effective in this dysmenorrhea that is a
 disorder resulting from uterine muscular contraction. It has almost no side effect although long-term use of
 vitamin B1 may cause headaches and, sometimes, palpitations. However, extra vitamin B1 is excreted in the
 urine due to its water solubility (Wyatt et al., 1991; National Academy Press, 1998).
 Vitamin B1 is used to treat varieties of physiological problems, such as nausea and vomiting; increase the quality
 of life; and decrease depression, fatigue, dysmenorrhea, muscle cramps, and anxiety in middle-aged women and
 women of reproductive age (McCormick, 1988).
 
<section> Some studies have reported the therapeutic effect of vitamin B on mild and moderate depression, and also its
 positive results in problems related to women of reproductive age. No side effect has been reported in patients
 using vitamin B in different studies. (Wyatt et al., 1991; National Academy Press, 1998; McCormick, 1988;
 McCormick, 1997; Bayliss et al., 1984; Bailey, 1994; Singleton et al., 1995; Gerrits et al., 1997; Yaghmaei et al.,
 2005).
 
<section> Certain studies conducted on determining the effect of vitamin B1 on problems related to women of reproductive
 age showed positive results. However, regarding the inadequate research on the effect of vitamin B1 on severity
 of the PMS symptoms, high prevalence of PMS, side effects and high cost of invasive methods, the increasing
 tendency to complementary medicine, and lack of research in this regard in Iran, this study was conducted to
 determine the effect of vitamin B1 on the PMS symptoms in students residing at dormitories of Jahrom
 University of Medical Sciences in 2013. The researcher chose vitamin therapy as a practical strategy to control
 severity of the PMS symptoms.
 
<section> 2. Materials and Methods
 
<section> This clinical trial was performed on students residing at dormitories of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences.
 Samples were selected using purposive sampling method. The sample included 80 students who had mild to
 moderate PMS and met the inclusion criteria and resided at dormitories of Jahrom University of Medical
 Sciences. However, the sample size was estimated 100 students due to the possible dropout. 
<insert> Figure 1. Selection of samples 
<iend>

 Duration of sampling was 8 months ending in Aug. 2013. The inclusion criteria were as follows: having regular
 menstrual cycles between 24 to 35 days, aged 18 to 30 years old, bleeding for 3 to 8 days, and being single. The
 exclusion criteria were as follows: suffering mental or physical diseases; using antidepressants, hormones,
 contraceptives (used to treat some diseases), vitamins, and herbal medications; exercising regularly;
 experiencing stress in the last three months; death of close relatives; marrying; and undergoing surgical
 operation.
 
<section> The samples in this study were first selected purposively then were divided into two groups randomly using the
 Random Allocation software. In this regard, the researcher went to the dormitories of Jahrom University of
 Medical Sciences and gave a questionnaire about the inclusion criteria to the students. The students who had the
 inclusion criteria were given the PMS provisional diagnosis form. Then, those who had at least 5 symptoms were
 given Beck Depression Inventory. If the students were diagnosed to be normal and non-depressed based on their
 obtained score, they were selected as a research sample and requested to submit a written consent. Then, a
 demographics questionnaire was completed by the samples. The samples also completed the daily status record
 form for two consecutive cycles. The samples who exercised self-treatment was excluded (Figure 1).

<section> The daily status record form included 20 symptoms of PMS, which were adopted from DSMIV criteria, as
 follows: tension, ambivalence, irritability, anxiety, depression, fatigue, headache, forgetfulness, palpitations,
 decreased libido, increased appetite, suicidal ideation, limb edema, breast tenderness, sleep disorder, Desire to
 eat sweets, flatulence, poor concentration, crying for no particular reason, and incompatibility. The students
 experiencing at least 5 symptoms 7 days before menstruation up to 4 days after menstruation and no symptoms
 in the rest of the cycle were diagnosed to have PMS. The samples marked the severity of their daily symptoms as
 none to severe (0-3). Content validity was used to measure the validity of the questionnaires. In this regard, the
 questionnaires were formulated on the basis of relevant books, articles, previous studies, corrective comments of
 specialists in obstetrics, gynecology, psychiatry, psychology, and pharmacology, and then given to 5 people of

 The total mental and physical symptom in the two groups was the same. According to the daily status record
 form, there was no significant difference between placebo group and vitamin B1 group in terms of the mean total
 physical symptom before the treatment, and both groups were matched in this regard (Table 2).

 the study population and their comments were applied. To determine reliability of the questionnaires, the
 Cronbach's alpha was used. In this regard, the questionnaires were given to 10 people of the study population,
 and the Cronbach's alpha of 80% was obtained.
 
<section> Finally, 100 students with inclusion criteria were divided into two groups with specific coding using the Random
 Allocation software and computerized table of random list. The first group consisted of 50 students using
 placebo, and the other group consisted of 50 students using vitamin B1. Two pills with identical appearance
 made by the advisor pharmacist were given to the placebo group (pills containing 100 mg of starch powder) and
 vitamin B1 group (pills containing 100 mg of vitamin B1 made by Tehran Daroupakhsh Co.) (European
 Commission. Health & Consumer Protection Directorate-General, 2011; Fao/Who expert consultation on human
 vitamin and mineral requirements, 2011). The samples used one pill in the morning and one pill at night during
 one week before menstruation (at the end of the luteal phase) when the symptoms were most severe for three
 consecutive cycles and, concurrently, completed the questionnaires through marking symptoms. Meanwhile, the
 samples were ensured of the lack of serious side effects of the pills and were requested to inform the researcher
 the incidence of any side effect or problem in order to be followed. To ensure recording of information by the
 samples, they were texted every week, and a short visit was held every two weeks.
 
<section> The daily status record form was examined after three months of treatment, and physical and mental symptoms
 were measured separately before and after the treatment. Of the samples, 10 samples withdrew from the study,
 samples were excluded from the study because they needed taking medicines for their severe breast tenderness,
 and 7 samples were also excluded from the study because they did not complete the questionnaires. In total,
 samples were excluded from the study. The data collected form 80 samples (40 samples in the placebo group and
 40 samples in vitamin B1 group) were analyzed using SPSS16 software.
 
<section> Paired t-test was used to measure variations in severity of PMS in each group before and after the intervention,
 and the independent t-test was used to measure the difference in severity of PMS between the two groups.
 Moreover, the Chi-square test was used to determine the tendency to continue using pills, and Fisher's exact test
 was used to determine the presence of side effects. The significance level for all tests was P < 0.05.
 
<section> 3. Results
 
<section> Of the 540 students screened primarily, 100 students with inclusion criteria were given the daily status record
 form for two cycles and divided into two groups, 50 students received placebo, and 50 students received vitamin
 B1. The samples were visited every two weeks in order to check the course of taking pills and side effects.
 Finally, 20 samples were excluded from the study for different reasons, such as the failure to complete the
 questionnaires, the failure to use the pills at the right time, unwillingness to continue, and incidence of side
 effects. Therefore, the final analysis was performed on 80 samples. The demographic variables and severity of
 symptoms in each group were compared to one another before the treatment, and their homogeneity was proved
 (Table 1). Mean age of samples was 21 years. In most of the samples, the menstrual bleeding and menstrual
 cycle interval were reported as 5 days and 28-30 days, respectively.

 As shown in Tables 3, 4, and 5, the two groups were not significantly different from each other in terms of the
 severity of symptoms, and results of the treatment showed that mean overall severity in vitamin B1 group in the
 first month and the second month of the treatment was 23.45 and 15.40, respectively. In placebo group, mean
 overall severity in the first month and the second month of the treatment was 45.4 and 35.40, respectively. Mean
 reduction of overall severity after two months in vitamin B1 group and placebo group was 32.09% and 12%,
 respectively. Mean reduction of overall severity for physical and mental symptoms after three months in vitamin
 B1 group was 21.2% and 35.08%, respectively. The comparison of variations in severity of symptoms before and
 after the intervention of both groups together revealed that overall severity of symptoms after the intervention in
 both groups decreased significantly (P < 0.001). However, vitamin B1 decreased the symptoms significantly
 more than placebo (P < 0.0001), (Table 3).

 in this respect between two groups (p < 0.0001) and in order to compare the groups (two by two),
 Mann–Whitney test showed significant difference between two groups with (p < 0.0001), (Table 5).
 The average mental symptoms severity of premenstrual syndrome has been reduced in Vitamin B1 group after
 treatment.
 
<section> Maximum reduction of severity was observed in symptoms, including anxiety (96%), depression (80.4%), sleep
 disorder (80.24%), fatigue (73.88%), poor concentration (70.51%), tension (55.2%), incompatibility (39%),
 suicidal ideation (18%), headache (8.38%), flatulence (7.98%), and breast tenderness (7.33%). Minimum
 reduction of severity was observed in symptoms, including the decreased libido (0.94%), desire to eat sweets
 (2.42%), limb edema (2.6%), forgetfulness (3.44%), and palpitations (3.71%). The tendency to continue using
 pills in vitamin B1 group and placebo group was 95% and 12.4%, respectively, and their difference was
 significant (P < 0.05). Vitamin B1 was ineffective in the duration of menstruation and bleeding, and most of the
 samples, 98.3% in vitamin B1 group and 100% in placebo group, did not report any side effects.

 after treatment, and the comparison was significantly different.
 
<section> The average of mental symptoms severity of premenstrual syndrome has been reduced in vitamin B1 group after

<section> 4. Discussions
 
<section> The results of this study showed that vitamin B1 reduced overall severity of symptoms and mental and physical
 symptoms of PMS in vitamin B1 group. There is no study was conducted on the effect of vitamin B1 on PMS in
 Iran, and there were few foreign studies in this regard. Therefore, comparing results of this study with those of
 other studies was limited. In their study on the comparison of the effect of vitamin B1 with that of ibuprofen,
 Zafari and Agha Mohammadi explained that vitamin B1 with an effect similar to that of Ibuprofen had fewer
 side effects and was more acceptable on treatment of primary dysmenorrhea (Agha mohammadi & Zafari, 2009).
 In Yaghmayi et al.’s study on the effect of combined vitamins B1 and B6 on leg cramps during pregnancy,
 samples in case and control groups received treatment with combined vitamins B1 and B6. After four weeks of
 follow-up, all the samples receiving treatment stated that combined vitamins B1 and B6 had reduced the number
 and severity of leg cramps (Yaghmaei et al., 2005). Moreover, some studies showed the effectiveness of vitamin
 B1 in decreasing depression, stress, anxiety, pain, fatigue, and sleep disorders; increasing the quality of life; and
 promoting blood circulation, metabolism of carbohydrates and aminoacids. As the above symptoms are also
 included in symptoms of PMS, a few studies in this regard are explained below (Wyatt et al., 1991; National
 Academy Press, 1998; McCormick, 1988; McCormick, 1997; Bayliss et al., 1984; Bailey, 1994; Singleton et al.,
 1995; Gerrits et al., 1997; Yaghmaei et al., 2005; Agha mohammadi & Zafari, 2009; Patricia et al., 2011;
 Bertone-Johnson et al., 2009; Gabriel, 2008).
 
<section> Patricia Chocano et al.'s study on the effect of a diet containing vitamin B1 on the incidence of PMS showed that
 receiving vitamin B1 and riboflavin from food reduced the risk of PMS. Gabriel conducted a study on vitamin B
 complex and its effects, and found that vitamin B1 was effective in releasing energy and improving blood
 circulation and digestion. Moreover, Gabriel showed that 30 mg of thiamine (vitamin B1) reduced skeletal
 muscle cramps, promoted perfusion to the heart, kidneys, liver, and brain, and was effective in metabolism of
 energy and nervous system functioning. Results of the present study agreed with those of Patricia Chocano et
 al.’s study and Gabriel’s study. As revealed by the present study, vitamin B1 could reduce all symptoms of PMS
 significantly (Patricia et al., 2011; Gabriel, 2008).
 
<section> Although the exact cause of PMS has not been known so far, the sexual hormones and central neurotransmitters
 are discussed more than other possible causes. Most symptoms of PMS are similar to those of reduced serotonin
 neurotransmitters, and thus, the first-line treatment to cure PMS is the use of methods with the mechanism of
 serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Ghazi-Jahani, 2007).
 
<section> As a coenzyme, vitamin B1 may reduce symptoms of PMS through affecting the performance of coenzymes in
 the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, protein and main branch of amino acid. Vitamin B is effective in energy
 metabolism, activities of the central nervous system, hematopoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, activities of
 neuromuscular system, muscle and cardiovascular tonus, promotion of blood circulation, and consequently,
 excretion of toxins from the body (Yaghmaei et al., 2005; Agha Mohammadi & Zafari, 2009).
 Gabriel pointed out that vitamin B1 could increase endorphin secretion and, subsequently, cause relaxation and
 stimulate sleeping through affecting the brain and liver and releasing ATP, and it could also promote
 cardiovascular system functioning. Thiamine affects the urinary tract, erythrocyte transketolase of blood
 circulation, blood lactate and pyruvate, and neurological changes (Gabriel, 2008). The role of alcohol in vitamin
 B1 reuptake is of special importance, and alcoholics are more likely to suffer psychological disorders and PMS.
 Nutritionists recommend using 1.1 mg of vitamin B1 per day in adult women for promoting energy level, and
 this amount of vitamin B1 should be much more for pregnant and lactating women. Therefore, the decrease in
 symptoms of PMS, especially mental symptoms, is justifiable (Bertone-Johnson et al., 2009).
 Hemostasis and hormonal imbalance are important etiologies of PMS (Steiner et al., 2006). In this respect,
 reduction of symptoms, such as flatulence, headache, breast pain, and palpitations with vitamin B1 is also
 justifiable. Vitamin B1 simulates the central nervous system and elevates mood, and consequently, causes deep
 relaxation and decreases mental pressure and tension. Therefore, the decrease in symptoms of PMS, especially
 mental symptoms, is reasonable.
 
<section> Similar to Patricia Chocano et al.’s study, the present study showed that vitamin B1 had no side effects. In other
 words, vitamin B1 was effective in treatment of PMS without any side effects. In this respect, regarding the 
<section> above advantage of vitamin B1, which was proved in this study, and prospective control of recording symptoms
 for 3 months, results of the present study are reliable.
 
<section> 5. Conclusion
 
<section> This study, which was performed for the first time in Iran, revealed that using vitamin B1 in luteal phase could
 reduce overall severity of physical and mental symptoms of PMS needless of using it in the entire menstrual
 cycle. Furthermore, vitamin B1 has no side effect and does not change menstrual bleeding pattern. Therefore,
 vitamin B1 is recommended for treatment of PMS.
 
<section> Moreover, further studies are recommended to obtain enough evidence for injection of vitamin B1 and its
 different dosages as a safe and effective medication for patients who do not desire to or cannot undergo invasive
 treatments.
 
<section> Furthermore, the starch powder was used as the placebo in this study. Given the effect of carbohydrates on
 alleviating PMS, further studies are suggested to use neutral powders.
