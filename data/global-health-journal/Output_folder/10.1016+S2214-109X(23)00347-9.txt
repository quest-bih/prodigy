<section> Author 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> Patients allocated to the experimental group were provided with two Polycap pills (Cadila
 Pharmaceuticals, Ahmedabad, India), taken orally once a day for 12 months. Each capsule
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> of Polycap contained 100 mg of aspirin, 20 mg of simvastatin, 12·5 mg hydrochlorothiazide,
 5 mg of ramipril, and 50 mg of atenolol. Patients assigned to the polypill had their
 antihypertensive agents, lipid modifiers, and antithrombotic agents withdrawn and replaced
 with the polypill if they were already receiving such treatments before enrolment.
 
<section> Patients allocated to the control group received standard-of-care therapies for secondary
 stroke prevention, with drugs and doses left to the discretion of the treating doctor. Routine
 secondary prevention medications available in Ghana include antithrombotics (aspirin or
 clopidogrel), statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin), and antihypertensive classes (angiotensin-
 
<section> Author converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, β blockers, calcium
 channel blockers, diuretics, and centrally acting agents). Of four study doctors, who were
 either senior registrars or junior doctors in neurology or general medicine, two took care of
 
<section> Manuscript participants in the polypill group and two took care of participants in the usual care group to
 avoid contamination.
 
<section> When available, stroke subtype information was collected to classify ischaemic stroke using
 the TOAST classification 17 into large-artery, lacunar, and unclassified ischaemic strokes. 
<section> Stroke severity and functional status at enrolment were assessed using the modified National

<section> of renal and liver function, lipid profile, and glycated haemoglobin were collected and
 contraindications for study medications assessed. Study participants were followed up
 for 12 months with scheduled visits in KATH at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 for clinical
 assessments and primary, secondary, and tertiary study outcome evaluations. Adverse events
 were assessed via both self-reports or reports by relatives, for any clinical event on a
 continuous basis during follow-up, or assessed as abnormalities in monitored laboratory
 parameters, such as liver and kidney function tests. Study doctors assessed participants
 for adverse events and graded these as mild, moderate, severe, or serious based on the
 common terminology criteria for adverse events, and recorded these into the case record
 
<section> Author forms. Serious adverse events were reported to the Ghana Foods and Drugs Authority and
 institutional review board within 48 h of the study team becoming aware.

<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome measure was change in the common carotid intima-media thickness
 (CIMT) over 12 months from baseline compared between the two groups. CIMT was
 measured using a Samsung SonoAce R7 Ultrasound machine (Gangwon-do, South Korea) at
 1 cm portions of the distal left and right common carotid artery far walls with a linear
 transducer (transducer frequency of 7·5 MHz) with axial resolution of 0·10 mm, and
 calculated automatically over three cardiac cycles following the Mannheim consensus.
 Average thickness of the left and right carotid arteries was used as the outcome measure.
 Each of the two sonographers obtained measurements independently of one another, and the
 
<section> Author readings were averaged. A post-hoc intracluster correlation coefficient for common CIMT
 measurements by the two sonographers of 0·51 for the left carotid artery and 0·53 for the
 right carotid artery, were deemed fair agreement (excellent agreement was deemed as 0·81–
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> 1·00).
 
<section> Secondary outcome measures included medication adherence, assessed via the self-reported
 Morisky-Green Adherence Scale score and the Hill Bone medication adherence scale.
 Medication possession ratio by pill counts, although proposed, could not be performed
 consistently in the usual care group, so was not reported. Safety and tolerability measures,
 such as changes in eGFR over 12 months, transaminitis on liver function tests, side-
 effects, and discontinuation of study medications and regimen adjustments, including the
 need to add on other secondary prevention interventions during follow-up, were also
 
<section> Author monitored. Other secondary outcomes were health-related quality-of-life changes measured
 by the EQ-5D questionnaire, 
<section> 21 patient satisfaction measured by the Treatment Satisfaction
 Questionnaire for Medication, 
<section> 22 global cognitive scores over 12 months measured by the
 
<section> Manuscript Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, 
<section> 23 and depression risk measured by the Hamilton
 Rating Scale for Depression. 
<section> 24 Prespecified tertiary or exploratory outcomes included
 assessment of changes in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and LDL-
 cholesterol at 12 months from baseline. In addition, all-cause mortality, major adverse
 cardiovascular events, and rehospitalisation for any cardiovascular-related events were also 
<section> assessed as prespecified outcomes. A full list of outcome measures is provided in appendix

 (with 95% CI) in CIMT changes, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, adherence scores,

 months from baseline by study group were compared using an ANCOVA with adjustment
 for baseline values. The numbers of safety outcomes were summarised according to the
 treatment group, and compared with the use of χ 2 tests or Fisher exact tests. Sensitivity
 analyses, with imputation for missing data, were conducted using multiple imputations by

 The study was conducted between Feb 12, 2019, and Dec 7, 2021. 
<section> Baseline characteristics are shown in table 1. The mean age was 58·5 years (SD 10·7) for the

 the number of participants on high intensity atorvastatin was 55 (74%) and 63 (85%),
 respectively. The most frequently prescribed antihypertensive drug class was calcium
 channel blockers, followed by angiotensin receptor blockers (table 1). After random
 allocation, all prescribed secondary prevention medications were stopped and replaced with
 the polypill for participants assigned to the polypill group, but continued for those assigned
 to the usual care group.
 
<section> The mean change in CIMT at month 12 from baseline was −0·017 mm (95% CI −0·067 to

<section> No between-group differences were observed in secondary outcome measures, namely
 quality of life, medication adherence, treatment satisfaction, global cognitive performance,
 functional status, and depression scores at month 12 (table 2). Compared with baseline
 values, at month 12 systolic blood pressure reduced by 15·7 mm Hg (95% CI −23·1 to
 −8·3) in the polypill group and 17·6 mm Hg (−24·8 to −10·5) in the usual care group, and
 diastolic blood pressure reduced by 7·9 mm Hg (−12·2 to −3·5) and 3·3 mm Hg (−7·7 to 1·0)
 in each group, respectively. At month 12, 29 (49%) of 59 in the polypill group versus
 (42%) of 64 in the usual care group had blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg (p=0·44).
 Change in LDL-cholesterol was −7·87 mg/dL (−19·98 to 4·24) in the polypill group versus
 
<section> Author 3·43 mg/dL (−8·77 to 15·63) in the usual care group (p=0·088), with 41 (72%) of 57 on
 an LDL-cholesterol target of less than 100 mg/dL at month 12 in the polypill group versus
 37 (59%) of 63 in the usual care group (p=0·82). Appendix 2 (p 12) shows comparisons

<section> between baseline and month 12 outcome measurements by study group.
 
<section> In table 3, the primary and secondary outcome measures were similar compared with the
 analysis without imputation for missing data. However, the mean reduction in diastolic
 blood pressure by month 12 was significantly greater in the polypill group (−12·04 mm Hg
 [95% CI −16·22 to −7·86]) versus the usual care group (−5·65 mm Hg [−9·91 to −1·39];
 p=0·020). The adjusted mean difference in LDL-cholesterol between groups was −12·99

 respectively (table 4). Four of the five deaths in the polypill group and both deaths in the
 usual care group occurred among participants who also had type 2 diabetes. Specific causes
 of death by study group include two cardiovascular deaths in the polypill group versus one 
<section> cardiovascular death in the usual care group; three sepsis deaths occurred in the polypill
 
<section> Author group but none in the usual care group (appendix 2 p 13).
 
<section> Treatment discontinuations were all due to side-effects, notably ACE-inhibitor-associated

 regimens were modified infrequently during follow-up of the trial, occurring in five (7%)
 of 74 participants in the polypill group versus seven (10%) of 74 in the usual care group
 (p=0·55). In the polypill group, treatment regimen adjustments involved the addition of
 antihypertensive drug classes among participants whose blood pressure was not controlled
 during follow-up. Rates of bradycardia, severely elevated blood pressure (>180/110 mmHg),
 and hypotension (<90/60 mm Hg) by study group are shown in appendix 2 (p 14). Appendix

<section> Discussion
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> In this phase 2 clinical trial, secondary prevention after stroke using standard-of-care
 therapy of individual antihypertensive, statin, and antithrombotic medications selected at
 the discretion of doctors resulted in no difference in regression of CIMT over 12 months
 than a fixed-dose polypill. Although the absolute mean difference in CIMT regression
 over 12 months of −0·080 mm significantly favoured the usual care group compared with
 the polypill group, this difference was not significant when baseline CIMT values were
 accounted for using ANCOVA, and an even smaller difference was found between groups
 after imputation for missing data in our sensitivity analysis. For randomised controlled
 trials assessing quantitative treatment effects assessed before and after treatment, the use
 
<section> Author of ANCOVA is deemed a more rigorous approach than Student’s t tests in terms of bias,
 precision, and statistical power.
 
<section> Manuscript There were similar reductions in blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in
 both groups at 12 months, both of which are key pathophysiological determinants of
 CIMT regression. It is plausible that differences in statins and antihypertensive drug
 classes used in the polypill group relative to the usual care group could have accounted
 for the adjusted mean difference of −0·049 mm per year of regression in CIMT, which,
 although not significant, favoured the usual care group. Although the usual care group was
 prescribed high intensity atorvastatin at doses ranging between 40 mg and 80 mg at stroke
 onset, which continued during the trial, the polypill group were dosed with simvastatin
 at 40 mg (equivalent to 20 mg of atorvastatin). A previous study among individuals
 
<section> Author with familial hypercholesterolaemia treated with 80 mg of atorvastatin compared with
 40 mg of simvastatin reported a −0·067 mm per year regression in CIMT in favour of
 atorvastatin. 
<section> 26 Again, although the polypill group homogeneously received a combination
 
<section> Manuscript of three antihypertensive drug classes (ACE inhibitor, β blocker, and a diuretic), drug
 regimens for the usual care group were quite heterogeneous, and contained predominantly
 angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and a diuretic as the most
 common combination. Meta-analytical data suggest that, among antihypertensive drug
 classes, calcium channel blockers reduce CIMT more potently than other drug classes, 
<section> independently of blood pressure lowering. 
<section> 27 Despite the compositional differences in the
 
<section> Author drug regimens between the two groups, regression of CIMT—a validated surrogate marker
 of cardiovascular events—was similar among people who recently had a stroke in the
 present study.
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> Treatment with the polypill was tolerated well, with an overall withdrawal rate of 4%
 on account of persistent cough. It is important to emphasise that, in our study design,
 participants assigned to the polypill were switched from their existing secondary prevention
 medication directly to the polypill. We did not incorporate a run-in period to assess
 tolerability and probable adherence of the polypill before randomisation, unlike previous
 primary prevention polypill trials. The TIPS-3 study 
<section> 10 had an active run-in period of
 month, in which 715 (9·5%) of 7534 participants were not randomly allocated due to
 side-effects, and 560 (7·4%) of 7534 were excluded as they did not reach 80% adherence.
 
<section> Author It is noteworthy that although asymptomatic bradycardia was more frequently documented
 in the polypill group, no treatment withdrawals were indicated on these accounts. Treatment
 satisfaction ratings were similar between the two groups. Serious adverse events were more
 
<section> Manuscript frequent in the polypill group than the usual care group. However, individual frequencies of
 serious adverse events (deaths, hospitalisations, and seizures) were not significantly different
 between the two groups (table 4). Although adherence to the polypill has been hypothesised
 to be its main advantage, we did not observe superior self-reported adherence in the
 polypill group compared with usual care. Furthermore, no between-group differences were
 discovered in other exploratory secondary outcomes, including quality of life, functional
 status, depression scores, and cognitive performance scores over 12 months. Nonetheless,
 within-group comparisons from baseline to month 12 showed salutary effects in these
 secondary outcome measures in each study group (appendix 2 p 12).
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Regarding blood pressure control, participants in the polypill group had a mean systolic
 blood pressure reduction of 16 mm Hg compared with 18 mm Hg in the usual care
 group, and a diastolic blood pressure reduction of 8 mm Hg versus 3 mm Hg in the
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> usual care group. In our sensitivity analysis with imputation for missing data in the ITT
 dataset, diastolic blood pressure reduced significantly in the polypill group by −12 mm Hg
 versus −6 mm Hg in the usual care group (p=0·020). Despite these reductions, only 49%
 of participants in the polypill group versus 42% of participants in the usual care group
 achieved blood pressure targets of less than 140/90 mm Hg at month 12. For a clinical
 trial on secondary stroke prevention, this lower-than-expected control of blood pressure
 is concerning. The most plausible proximate cause for the poor blood pressure control is
 clinical inertia, whereby trial clinicians did not intensify therapy appropriately when blood
 pressure goals were not reached. Among participants in the polypill group, only 7% had
 
<section> Author additional classes of antihypertensive medications added during follow-up, compared with
 10% in the usual care group. For participants on the polypill, doctors might have been
 reluctant to consider additional drug classes during follow-up due a perception that the
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> polypill should be taken as a single pill for secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
 However, for those in the usual care group, clinical inertia might have been due to concerns
 with increasing the number of pills patients would take at a single time, from treatment
 intensification, blood pressure measurements that were close to the target, and a focus on
 other more urgent needs of patients who have had a stroke, such as rehabilitation and a host 
<section> of other post-stroke complications. Another possible explanation could be the high burden of
 
<section> Author treatment-resistant or refractory hypertension among people who have had a stroke, resulting
 in difficulties in controlling blood pressure in this population.
 
<section> Manuscript An LDL-cholesterol target of less than 100 mg/dL was achieved by 72% of participants
 in the polypill group versus 59% in the usual care group. In the sensitivity analysis,
 the polypill group had an 18·39 mg/dL reduction in LDL-cholesterol compared with a
 4·65 mg/dL reduction in the usual care group, a difference of nearly −12·99 mg/dL;
 p=0·075. It is notable that the numerically better (although non-significant) reduction in
 LDL-cholesterol was achieved with a polypill containing simvastatin, a moderate intensity
 statin, compared with the usual care group, in which most participants were on atorvastatin
 or rosuvastatin. It is likely that differences in adherence and quality of statins prescribed
 in the usual care group could account partly for this observation. The polypill was taken
 
<section> Author once daily in the morning, whereas the usual care participants had multiple individual
 medications that they took throughout the day plus a nightly dose of atorvastatin or
 rosuvastatin (more likely to be missed than medications taken during the daytime). A
 
<section> Manuscript pill-count analysis for medication adherence instead of self-reported adherence might help
 to elucidate the underlying determinants of LDL-cholesterol outcomes in future planned
 studies. Our analyses of key vascular risk factor targets, although exploratory in nature,
 do seem to suggest that the polypill has a similar effect to usual care on blood pressure
 and LDL-cholesterol control for secondary stroke prevention. In the SECURE trial, 
<section> 11 the
 only published secondary polypill trial among people who had a myocardial infarction,
 blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol control were similar between the polypill and usual
 care groups at 24 months, akin to the findings in our present study. Deaths reported in the
 present study were predominantly among participants with diabetes, a vascular risk group
 at heightened risk of mortality. 
<section> 28 Cardiovascular deaths occurred infrequently, with two
 
<section> Author
 
<section> (3%) events in the polypill group versus one (1%) event in the usual care group in the ITT
 analysis.
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> This study was conducted in a single tertiary medical centre, limiting its generalisability.
 Usual care was provided by physician specialists who were familiar with stroke guidelines
 for secondary prevention. Future study designs should consider inclusion of primary
 and secondary levels of health-care delivery in resource-limited settings to compare the
 clinical utility and performance of polypills in these settings. For context, a previous study
 found that up to 75% of people who had a stroke received post-discharge stroke care
 in primary and secondary cadres of health-care delivery in Ghana. 
<section> 29 Up to 50% of the
 study population had ischaemic stroke of an undetermined cause, due to lack of diagnostic
 investigation such as CT or magnetic resonance angiography, and Holter monitoring to
 
<section> Author detect intracranial atherosclerotic disease and paroxysmal arrhythmias. Although having a
 cardioembolic stroke was an explicit exclusion criterion because of the need for therapy
 with anticoagulant, the challenge with diagnostic evaluation means that there is a possibility
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> that a proportion of participants with undetermined ischaemic stroke might have had a
 cardioembolic stroke. We also acknowledge that the inter-rater agreement between the two
 independent CIMT readings per participant by the sonographers using a post-hoc intracluster
 correlation coefficient was fair. 
<section> A study completion rate of 80% (59 of 74) in the polypill group versus 86% (64 of 74)
 
<section> Author in the usual care group over 12 months for a stroke trial conducted during the COVID-19
 pandemic is encouraging, and supports the feasibility of conducting similar clinical trials in
 a resource-limited setting. To our knowledge, this is the first published trial assessing the
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> effect of the polypill for secondary stroke prevention in a population of people who had
 already had a stroke. Another registered ongoing trial, the PROPS study on the preventive
 role of a fixed-dose combination pill in patients with stroke in the UK (ISRCTN58452386),
 is yet to publish their full results from a high-income country context.
 
<section> Future studies should consider a longer follow-up to assess whether clinically relevant
 outcomes, such as major adverse cardiovascular events, occur differentially in polypill
 groups compared with usual care groups. It might be worthwhile considering polypill
 preparations with high intensity statins, and different formulations of the polypill
 
<section> Author with flexibility to allow for adjustments. For example, the CNIC (Spanish Centre for
 Cardiovascular Research) polypill used in the SECURE trial 
<section> 11 had two dose formats
 for atorvastatin (20 mg and 40 mg) and three doses of ramipril (2·5 mg, 5 mg, or
 
<section> Manuscript mg) plus 100 mg of aspirin, giving a total of six versions of the polypill for enhanced
 flexibility and ease of dose adjustment. For antihypertensive combinations in future polypill
 formulations, replacing ACE inhibitors, of which cough is a side-effect, with angiotensin
 receptor blockers and atenolol with longer-acting calcium channel blockers might further
 improve the tolerability and efficacy of the polypill for a much larger population of patients
 for secondary prevention purposes. Understandably, such modifications of the composition
 of the polypill would require further bioequivalence studies and regulatory approvals before
 clinical testing for use. Given the heterogeneity of pathophysiological mechanisms for
 ischaemic stroke, future trials should be powered to assess treatment effects by stroke
 subtypes. Finally, robust implementation of outcome measures must be performed in future
 
<section> Author
 
<section> polypill trials to understand the barriers and facilitators associated with the uptake of this
 intervention in resource-limited settings across the globe, as well as underserved populations
 
<section> Manuscript in high-income countries. It is conceivable that the polypill could be positioned as a viable
 and cost-effective treatment strategy for people who have had a stroke, a population who are
 often burdened by complex treatment regimens and polypharmacy.
 
<section> In conclusion, there was similar regression of CIMT over 12 months among people who
 had recently had a stroke assigned to either the polypill or usual care group. Furthermore,
 no significant differences in key cardiovascular risk factor outcomes, such as blood pressure
 control, LDL-cholesterol targets, adherence, or individual safety endpoints were observed.
 A phase 3 clinical trial with a non-inferiority design and longer follow-up is warranted to
 assess the effect of a polypill among patients with ischaemic stroke.

<section> Evidence before this study
 
<section> Manuscript We performed a literature search of articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and Jan
 1, 2023, on clinical trials assessing effect of cardiovascular polypills for secondary
 prevention among patients with established cardiovascular diseases including stroke.
 We searched PubMed for articles in English using the terms “secondary prevention”,
 “cardiovascular polypill”, “stroke survivors”, and “atherosclerotic risk reduction”. We
 did not identify any published polypill-based clinical trial dedicated to people who had
 survived a stroke.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 
<section> In this phase 2 randomised controlled clinical trial, conducted in a tertiary medical centre
 
<section> Author in Ghana, we assigned 148 patients with ischaemic stroke within the previous 2 months
 to either a polypill-based strategy or to usual care. To our knowledge, this study shows
 for the first time that the polypill is similar to standard care for achieving regression in
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> carotid intimal media thickness, a validated marker of atherosclerotic event risk among
 people who have recently had a stroke.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 
<section> Given the heterogeneity of mechanisms leading to stroke occurrence and the requirement
 for a tailored approach to secondary prevention, future polypill trials in this patient
 population should consider a range of formulations of the polypill that allows for greater
 flexibility in dosing to accommodate a variety of dosing requirements for this patient
 group. Implementation outcomes are urgently needed to understand the barriers and
 
<section> Author facilitators to the diffusion and uptake of the polypill across diverse health-care settings,
 especially in resource-limited settings in Africa.
