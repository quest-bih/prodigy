<section> Results. We found strong continued intervention effects; nearly all women maintained treat-

<section> Conclusions. This study extends prior research to show that treatment impacts can be main-
 tained for several years despite experiences of ongoing trauma. The women described continu-

 psychotherapy, providing evidence of the potential for these programs to provide valuable
 social supports and skills that people use as they continue to face adversity.
 
<section> Introduction
 
<section> Mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress are common glo-
 bally and elevated in areas of high poverty and instability (Lund et al., 2010; Banks et al., 2018).
 The last two decades have a growth in treatment trials in low- and middle-income countries
 designed to determine what kind of interventions are effective in reducing the burden of these
 problems (Barry et al., 2013; Chibanda et al., 2015; Purgato et al., 2018) and how these inter-
 ventions can be implemented in contexts with few formal mental health professionals or ser-
 vices (Joshi et al., 2014; Munodawafa et al., 2018). Many studies have found that intervention
 effects wane after 3–6 months (Purgato et al., 2018); and for those that have found continued
 effects (Bass et al., 2006; Maselko et al., 2015), there is a lack of data on the extent to which
 impacts are sustained several years later.
 Data from high-income country studies suggest that impacts of cognitive-behavioral ther-

 (CPT) treatment effects were maintained for depression and PTSD symptoms at three, six,
 and nine months post treatment for a group of women who had experienced sexual trauma
 (Resick et al., 2002) and then again at ‘long term follow-up’, ranging from 5 to 10 years
 after treatment (Resick et al., 2012; Wachen et al., 2014). 
<section> Multiple theories have been postulated for how treatments
 might continue to confer benefits long after the formal treatment
 period is complete. Cognitive theory posits that cognitive therapy
 teaches skills in how to identify and change maladaptive cogni-
 tions, and that the change in processing this information is
 what leads to the maintenance of symptom change (Beck,
 2005). In CPT specifically, changes in trauma-related beliefs pre-
 dict symptom improvement during treatment (Sobel et al., 2009)
 and reductions in maladaptive trauma-related beliefs predict
 lower PTSD and depressive symptoms 5–10 years after treatment
 (Iverson et al., 2015). At the same time, context matters and fac-
 tors such as lower socioeconomic status predict poorer long-term
 functioning following treatment (Wachen et al., 2014).
 To our knowledge, there have been no long-term (> 2 years)
 follow-up of psychotherapy studies for common mental health
 problems in a low-income country, particularly one where
 ongoing instability and conflict is common with populations con-
 tinually being exposed to a myriad of traumas. This study looks at
 mental health outcome data collected approximately 6 years after
 intervention completion among women who participated in a
 12-session group CPT program in the eastern Democratic
 Republic of Congo. The research questions are: (1) what propor-
 tion of women maintained the symptom reductions observed
 1-year posttreatment and (2) what client- or treatment-level vari-
 ables were associated with continued treatment impact.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> The parent study (Bass et al., 2013) included 405 adult women
 who had reported personally experiencing sexual violence and
 presented with moderate to severe symptoms of depression, anx-
 iety and/or PTSD and impaired functioning; these women lived in
 15 study villages that were randomly allocated to the CPT (N =
 villages) or individual support conditions (n = 8 villages). Baseline
 assessment was completed in December 2010 and the interven-
 tion period was from April through July 2011 with CPT provided
 by local psychosocial workers trained and supervised by US-based
 CPT trainers. Primary study outcomes were reduction in symp-
 toms of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress and improve-
 ment in functional impairment. Treatment impacts at 6-month
 post treatment were previously reported (Bass et al., 2013); briefly
 CPT, as compared with individual support alone, was effective in
 reducing PTSD symptoms (effect size 1.3) and combined depres-
 sion and anxiety symptoms (effect size 1.6) and improving func-
 tioning (effect size 1.2) in this sample of female survivors of
 sexual violence. Following the 6-month follow-up, women in
 the CPT villages were invited to participate in a year-long
 social-economic program (Village Savings and Loans
 Associations; VSLA) and were re-assessed a fourth time after
 that program was completed; ninety-seven women participated
 in the VSLA program.
 For the current follow-up, which occurred in March 2017
 approximately 6.3 years after baseline, women in 6 of 7 CPT vil-
 lages were approached; one village was not visited due to ongoing
 security issues and the individual support villages were not visited
 as potential comparators as their psychosocial workers had subse-
 quently been trained in CPT and provided the treatment to those
 still needing services. Figure 1 shows the flow of CPT participants
 for each of the five data collection time points from the study
 baseline through the long-term follow-up (see Table 1 for demo-
 graphics at baseline and long-term follow-up).
 
<section> Measures
 
<section> To assess PTSD symptoms, we utilized the 16-item Harvard
 Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ; Mollica et al., 1992) symptom sec-
 tion and to assess depression and anxiety symptoms we used the
 Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25; Hesbacher et al., 1980;
 Winokur et al., 1984) which includes 15 depression symptoms
 and 10 anxiety symptoms. The mental health measures were
 adapted and pilot-tested in each of the three study language
 groups (Mashi, Kifuliro and Swahili). Both the HSCL-25 and
 the HTQ have been used internationally with sexual-violence sur-
 vivors and conflict-affected samples generally (Halepota and
 Wasif, 2001; Kleijn et al., 2001; Ventevogel et al., 2007;
 Rasmussen et al., 2015; Wind et al., 2017). Participants rated
 the frequency of each symptom in the prior 4 weeks on a four-
 point Likert scale (with 0 denoting not at all, 1 a little bit, 2 a
 moderate amount, and 3 a lot). Average per-person scores were
 generated for each measure, with scores ranging from 0 to 3;
 higher scores indicate greater severity. An average score of 1.75
 or higher on either measure was considered to be predictive of
 clinically significant symptoms on the basis of data from other
 conflict-affected populations (Mollica et al., 1987, 1992). Both
 measures were completed at all assessment points, yielding five
 data points.
 Other self-report measures administered at the long-term
 follow-up assessment included basic demographic characteristics,
 a locally-developed measure of daily functioning, an index of past
 6-month trauma experiences, continued use of each CPT skill
 including examples of when the skills were used, and continued
 meetings with CPT group participants. The daily functioning
 measure consists of 20 tasks of daily living that focus on activities
 related to caring for one’s self, one’s family, and one’s community.
 Participants rated the amount of difficulty they had completing
 each task in the prior 4 weeks on a five-point Likert scale (with
 0 denoting no difficulty at all, 1 a little bit of difficulty, 2 a mod-
 erate amount of difficulty, 3 a lot of difficulty, and 4 unable to
 complete the task). Average per-person scores were generated,
 with scores ranging from 0 to 4; higher scores indicate greater
 functional impairment.
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> CPT is a protocol-based therapy with strong evidence for redu-
 cing the burden of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms in
 sexual-violence survivors. For this study, CPT was provided in a
 group format with 6–8 women per group. We used the
 cognitive-only version of the treatment (i.e. without a trauma nar-
 rative) because its efficacy is similar to that of the full version of
 the therapy (Resick et al., 2008), while providing greater ease of
 administration in groups. The treatment included 1 individual
 session (1 hour) and 11 sessions with six to eight women per
 group (2 hours each). The therapy was adapted to meet the
 needs of a predominantly illiterate population who were at risk
 for exposure to ongoing violence (Bolton et al., 2014).
 The psychosocial assistants (PSA) who provided therapy were
 village-based Congolese women who had been providing general
 psychosocial care to sexual violence for at least 1 year prior to the
 trial; none had prior mental health training. The PSAs received
 weeks of in-person training with CPT trainers from the United
 States in the use of a manual that was adapted to the local context
 and educational level of the PSAs (most had completed secondary
 education) and translated locally. Direct supervision was provided 
<insert> Fig. 1. Participant flow chart. 
<iend>

 by Congolese psychosocial supervisors who were employees of
 The International Rescue Committee (IRC), the partner research
 and implementing organization, through weekly telephone or
 in-person meetings. A bilingual clinical social worker trained in
 the U.S. supervised the psychosocial supervisors and communi-
 cated with the U.S. trainers weekly to monitor quality and fidelity.
 Each PSA concurrently led three CPT groups.
 
<section> Data analysis
 
<section> Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic and symp-
 tom variables at baseline for the full baseline sample from the six
 targeted villages randomized to CPT and separately for women
 who completed the long-term follow-up. Characteristics were
 compared for women in these villages who did and did not
 participate in the long-term follow-up using student’s t tests
 and Fisher’s exact tests due to small cell sizes. We also calculated
 descriptive statistics for women’s responses to questions about the
 frequency of meeting with CPT groups and the types of activities
 they engaged in related to use of CPT skills.
 To assess differences in mental health and functional
 impairment outcomes at long term follow-up as compared to
 pre-CPT, baseline mean symptom and function scores were
 compared to mean scores at each subsequent time point
 (post-treatment, 6-months post-treatment, 18-months
 post-treatment, and at the long-term follow-up approximately
 6 years-post-treatment) using paired t tests for continuous
 mean symptoms scores and McNemar’s test for binary probable
 diagnosis using all available data from women who participated
 in the long-term follow-up.

 For the subsample of women (n = 76) who met our baseline
 criteria for probable clinically significant symptoms (a score of
 1.75 or higher on either measure), we explored remission and
 recovery over the follow-up period. Remission was defined as
 dropping below the cut-off score at one of the follow-up assess-
 ments but then moving back above the cut-off at a later follow
 up. Recovery was defined as dropping below the cut-off and
 remaining below the cut-off at all follow-up assessments.
 To assess the extent to which initial symptom changes after
 participation in CPT were maintained in the long-term for all
 study women, we categorized women based on symptom score
 changes from immediate post-treatment or six-months post-
 treatment (whichever was lower) to final assessment. We categor-
 ized women into those who: (1) maintained reductions: whose
 symptom score changed by only a small amount (⩽0.5 points);
 (2) women who partially maintained reductions: whose symptom
 score increased by more than 0.5 but less than 1.0 points; or (3)
 women who did not maintain their reductions: whose symptom
 scores increased by 1.0 points or more. The possible symptom
 score range for the mental health measures is 0 to 3.0 points
 (0 = not experiencing the symptom at all; 1 = some of the time;
 2 = a moderate amount of time; 3 = all the time); an increase in
 1.0 suggests a full category change.
 We used multinomial logistic regression to assess whether the
 following characteristics of women recorded at study baseline
 were associated with symptom maintenance by comparing
 women who maintained symptom reductions (group 1)
 with women who partially maintained reductions (group 2) and
 women who did not maintain reductions (group 3): age, marital
 and pregnancy status, whether they had lived in the area for
 years or more, number of people living in the home, number of
 children women were responsible for, total number of types of
 traumas witnessed, total number of types of traumas experienced,
 and functional impairment, as well as depression, trauma, and
 total symptoms. These are the same predictors that were explored
 in the original trial paper (Bass et al., 2013). In addition, we
 assessed whether the number of CPT skills a woman still used,
 participation in a VSLA group, number of types of trauma experi-
 enced or witnessed in the past six months, and frequency with
 which a woman had met with her CPT group in the past six
 months as reported at this follow-up was associated with the
 maintenance classifications.
 The Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of the Johns Hopkins
 University and the Kinshasa School of Public Health approved
 the original trial protocol; the Johns Hopkins University IRB
 approved the amendment for the current follow-up. The sample
 of women who participated in the CPT treatment groups in the
 original trial was contacted by their local psychosocial staff and
 personally invited to participate in this follow-up interview; con-
 sent was obtained by study interviewers for those women who
 agreed to participate.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Of the 134 women from the treatment arm in the 6 follow-up vil-
 lages of the original trial, 16 (12%) were unable to be located, had
 passed away, or were no longer living in the study area. In add-
 ition, 15 women (11%) declined or were unable to participate.
 Thus, 103 (77%) participated in this follow-up study; 99 (96%)
 of these women participated in at least 2 previous follow-up
 assessments. Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics of
 the full treatment sample and those who participated in the long-
 term follow-up at baseline and the follow-ups characteristics at
 the time of the 7-year follow-up. At this follow-up, the women
 continued to live in homes with multiple people and were respon-
 sible for, on average, four children. The percent of women mar-
 ried went down (from 65% to 56%) while the percent of
 widowed women went up (from 16% to 27%). At baseline, the
 study women reported a lifetime history of having experienced
 and witnessed a range of different types of traumas. Nearly 17%
 of the women reported experiencing sexual violence in the
 6-months before the final assessment was completed, with 45%
 reported having witnessed sexual violence.
 
<section> Symptom severity and functional impairment outcomes at
 
<section> each follow-up
 
<section> The trajectory of symptom changes for the 103 women in this
 follow-up study did not differ across the mental health and func-
 tion outcomes (Fig. 2). Looking at each time point (Table 2) the
 average baseline scores were close to 2.0, indicating that on aver-
 age, the women experienced nearly all of the symptoms ‘a mod-
 erate amount’ of the time. For the first 18 months after the
 treatment was complete, the women maintained average symptom
 scale scores below 1.0, indicating that on average the women
 experienced all of the symptoms less than ‘a little bit’ of the
 time. At the final follow-up, the average scores had increased,

<iend>

 but remained clinically and significantly less than initial baseline
 scores. Similar patterns were seen for the outcome of functioning,
 with impairment remaining down from baseline levels even at the
 final follow-up.
 
<section> Diagnosis, remission and recovery
 
<section> At baseline, 74% (n = 76) of the CPT participating women met
 criteria for a probable diagnosis of clinically significant depression
 and anxiety at baseline. 9 (12%) of these women did not move
 into remission at the post-intervention assessment and of these,
 6 remained above the cut-off at the final long-term assessments.
 Among the 67 women who remitted at the post-intervention
 assessment, 53 (79%) would be classified as recovered at the long-
 term follow-up assessment and 14 (21%) as having relapsed. For
 the posttraumatic stress symptoms, 61% (n = 63) of the CPT par-
 ticipating women met criteria for a probable diagnosis at baseline.
 Of these, 4 (6%) did not move into remission at the post-
 intervention assessment and 2 of these women remained above
 the cut-off at the long-term follow-up. For the 59 women who
 remitted at the post-intervention assessment, 47 (80%) would
 be classified as recovered at the long-term follow-up assessment
 and 12 (20%) as having relapsed.
 Table 3 presents results from the analysis to explore the main-
 tenance of total symptom score reductions during period between
 the last two assessment periods (18 months after treatment to
 long-term follow-up). Maintenance was defined as having scores
 increase or decrease by less than 0.5 points. Analyses to explore
 predictors of symptom maintenance or worsening did not iden-
 tify any significant demographic or clinical factors.
 
<section> CPT program outcomes
 
<section> At the long-term follow-up assessment, 90 (87%) women
 reported that they had continued to meet with the other
 women from their CPT groups, with 16 (18%) indicating they
 had met once or twice in the past 6 months, 17 (19%) indicating
 they had met about once a month, 29 (32%) reported meeting
 once per week and 24 (27%) reported meeting more than once
 per week. The activities they reported engaging in with the
 women from their group ranged from discussing their problems
 and feelings, socializing, and doing microfinance or other income
 generation activities. When asked directly, nearly all of them
 (97%) reported they used CPT skills to help one another.
 When asked about their ongoing use of specific skills learned
 during the CPT program, more than 75% of them women reported
 sometimes or often using each of the 5 CPT-specific skills.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> We found strong continued intervention effects in this long-term
 follow-up of 103 women who participated in a group psycho-
 logical treatment program in rural DRC. Nearly all of the
 women maintained the initial treatment impacts during the first
 18 months after treatment was complete, and after more than
 years from the end of treatment, approximately half continue to
 maintain their relatively low symptom scores. This despite
 ongoing regional instability and women’s continued exposure to
 traumatic events including sexual violence. Nearly 1 in
 women reported experiencing sexual violence in the 6-months
 prior to this final assessment; this is approximately twice the
 number of women who reported sexual violence in the long-term
 follow up of rape survivors participating in CPT in the U.S.
 (Resick et al., 2012). This is also better than would be expected
 in the absence of an available treatment; in a systematic review
 of longitudinal studies of populations with PTSD, the two studies
 that included patients who had experienced rape, assault and
 other types of violence reported recovery rates of 18% and 28%
 after 5 years (Steinert et al., 2015). These results were also robust
 for disorder designation, as we saw similar patterns for the PTSD
 symptom measure (HTQ) and for the depression/anxiety symp-
 tom measure (HSCL-25) and the conclusions did not change
 when analyses were done looking at the scores dimensionally or
 by probable diagnosis categorization.

 Relapse rates for both the probable PTSD diagnoses and for
 the depression and anxiety combined diagnosis were around
 20%; this is similar to what was found in the long-term follow
 up with female rape survivors in the U.S. (Resick et al., 2012).
 A similar percent was identified as having significant symptom
 worsening between the 18-month follow-up and the long-term
 follow-up assessment. In our exploratory analyses of potential
 predictors of relapse and symptom worsening, we did not identify
 any significant demographic or trauma-related factors.
 Continuing to meet with the other women from their groups
 was common and participation variables also did not predict
 relapse or symptom worsening.
 Despite a formal CPT program no longer being formally
 implemented by the providers in their communities due to lack
 of financial support for program implementation, many women
 reported that they continued to meet with the women from
 their group and reported continued use of the CPT skills. In
 some clinical settings in the US providers may have the option
 to provide booster CPT sessions if patients are demonstrating
 worsening symptoms or if they are faced with a new traumatic
 event (Resick et al., 2016). It is possible that the ongoing availabil-
 ity of the APS providers allowed women to get ongoing
 CPT-related support from them despite this not being formally
 part of the program. As the women spoke about using the CPT
 skills with the other women from their original group, it is also
 possible that these ongoing group sessions provided informal
 boosters from their peers. Women who participated in the CPT
 program as part of the trial were also invited to participate in a
 social-economic program (VSLA) that was implemented between
 the 6- and 18-month follow-up assessments and at the final
 follow-up, women did report doing microfinance activities with
 their groups.
 This speaks to the potential mechanisms by which the women
 continued to benefit from the original CPT program. The CPT
 treatment program provided the women with cognitive skills
 that they reported continuing to use to deal with the violence
 and ongoing adversity in their lives. This is particularly relevant
 as this region of DRC continues to experience instability and con-
 flict and sexual violence continues to be prevalent (Guterres,
 2019). This supports the theory that teaching cognitive and emo-
 tional skills, and the use of cognitive restructuring, may indeed be
 a mechanism for the maintenance of symptom gains. In CPT,
 group members are taught to use the cognitive skills to help chal-
 lenge each other’s maladaptive cognitions, which may also help
 maintain treatment effects.
 Another potential mechanism is the group-based delivery of
 the psychotherapy, which created access to a trusted group of

<section> peers who have similar skills to provide support and ongoing
 advice. Previous research with this sample showed that the
 group CPT participants experienced more structural social capital
 and emotional support compared with participants in the individ-
 ual support condition (Hall et al., 2014), which may have been
 directly related to the support from the other group members.
 A long-term follow up of group-based interpersonal psychother-
 apy (IPT) found that the groups continued to meet several years
 later (Lewandowski et al., 2016), so this finding of continued
 group meetings may be an important factor to explore in future
 group-based treatment studies.
 We did not find participant-level characteristics (demograph-
 ics, recent trauma history, initial baseline scores) that differen-
 tiated which women were able to maintain the treatment
 impacts. Some potentially important factors, including cumulative
 trauma exposure and other life events that may have occurred in
 the intervening period were not captured in our assessments.
 Consistent with past research on predictors of poorer long-term
 outcomes in CPT, it is possible that the economic hardships
 faced by women in these communities may also be a factor in
 the higher rate of relapse in this sample, as compared to US sam-
 ples (Wachen et al., 2014).
 There are several limitations that must be noted, including the
 lack of an available comparison group as the women in the ori-
 ginal control villages received CPT after the trial was complete.
 In addition, there are unmeasured predictors that may be import-
 ant that were not collected as part of this study including cumu-
 lative trauma exposure, change in trauma-related cognitions
 (Iverson et al., 2015), which might have provided further detail
 on potential mechanisms of treatment maintenance. We also
 did not look at the symptom level to see whether there were spe-
 cific symptoms that were more treatment resistant or more likely
 to re-occur than others (Larsen et al., 2019). Individual symptoms
 that are more prone to re-occur or are treatment resistant such as
 sleep, detachment, fatigue, or guilt might provide directions for
 refining interventions. Finally, we have limited data on what
 other programs may have been implemented in the study com-
 munities over the 5-year follow-up period; anecdotally the
 women did not report any major NGO or government initiatives,
 nor any new mental health programs in their communities.
 The original trial was the first to implement CPT with lay pro-
 viders for sexual violence survivors in a context of ongoing con-
 flict and sexual violence; the results indicated strong impacts of
 CPT participation on reducing the burden of depression, anxiety
 and PTSD symptoms and improving daily functioning. This long-
 term follow-up study shows that after 5 years from the final post-
 treatment follow-up, most CPT participants continue to meet
 with their original CPT groups, continue to use the cognitive skills
 that are fundamental to the CPT model, and continue to live with
 relatively low symptom burdens despite the presence of ongoing
 violence and conflict. This despite the CPT providers not having
 continued formal support to deliver this intervention, which is a
 challenge of many programs that begin as studies but are not
 embedded within existing systems of care. This study provides
 evidence that psychotherapies can act not only as treatments for
 reducing the burden of mental illness but can also act as preven-
 tion programs that can provide valuable skills that people can use
 as they continue to face adversity. This study also provides an
 argument for considering the long-term feasibility of implement-
 ing these types of programs from the initiation of the studies,
 including identifying systems to maintain the employment of
 trained providers.
