<section> Abstract
 
<section> Background Sub-Saharan Africa has high under-5
 mortality and low childhood immunisation rates. Vaccine-
 preventable diseases cause one-third of under-5 deaths.
 Text messaging reminders improve immunisation
 completion in urban but not rural settings in sub-Saharan
 Africa. Low adult literacy may account for this difference.
 The feasibility and impact of combined automated voice
 and text reminders on immunisation completion in rural
 sub-Saharan Africa is unknown.
 
<section> Methods We randomised parturient women at the Mother
 and Child Hospitals Ondo State, Nigeria, owning a mobile
 phone and planning for child immunisation at these study
 sites to receive automated call and text immunisation
 reminders or standard care. We assessed the completion
 of the third pentavalent vaccine (Penta-3) at 18 weeks of
 age, immunisation completion at 12 months and within
 1 week of recommended dates. We assessed selected
 demographic characteristics associated with completing
 immunisations at 12 months using a generalised binomial
 linear model with ‘log’ link function. Feasibility was
 assessed as proportion of reminders received.
 
<section> Results Each group had 300 mother−baby dyads with
 similar demographic characteristics. At 18 weeks,
 (86%) and 244 (81%) (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.98
 to 1.13; p=0.15) in the intervention and control groups
 received Penta-3 vaccine. At 12 months, 220 (74%) and
 196 (66%) (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.25; p=0.04) in the
 intervention and control groups received the measles
 vaccine. Infants in the intervention group were more
 likely to receive Penta-3 (84% vs 78%, RR 1.09, 95%
 CI 1.01 to 1.17; p=0.04), measles (73% vs 65%, RR
 1.13, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.26; p=0.02) and all scheduled
 immunisations collectively (57% vs 47%, RR 1.13, 95% CI
 1.02 to 1.26; p=0.01) within 1 week of the recommended
 date. No demographic character predicted immunisation
 completion. In the intervention group, 92% and 86%
 reported receiving a verification reminder and at least one
 reminder during the study period, respectively.
 
<section> Conclusion Paired automated call and text reminders
 significantly improved immunisation completion and
 timeliness.

<section> Key questions
 
<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► In sub-Saharan Africa, text message reminders
 alone improve childhood immunisation uptake in ur-
 ban areas but not in rural areas where literacy levels
 are lower.
 
<section> ► Low adult literacy rates in sub-Saharan Africa may
 limit the use of stand-alone text messaging reminder
 systems.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► In a semi-rural setting in Nigeria, paired automated
 voice call and text immunisation reminders signifi-
 cantly improved the completion and timely receipt
 of immunisations.
 
<section> ► Cost of transportation, distance to and length of time
 spent at the immunisation clinics were additional
 significant barriers to immunisation reported in this
 setting.
 
<section> What do the new findings imply?
 
<section> ► Our results add to the body of literature on the im-
 pact of phone reminders on immunisation comple-
 tion and inform research on innovative solutions
 capable of improving access to and efficiency of
 immunisation clinics.
 
<section> Introduction
 Vaccine-preventable diseases are a leading
 cause of under-5 mortality. 1 Sub-Saharan
 Africa (SSA) and Southeast Asia─regions
 with poor immunisation uptake and comple-
 tion rates─carry 80% of the global under-5
 mortality burden. 1 2 These regions contribute
 significantly to the stalled global immuni-
 sation coverage. 3 Nigeria has the highest
 number of underimmunised and unimmu-
 nised children worldwide. 3 4 A 2017 Nigerian
 National Immunization Coverage Survey
 estimated that 37% and 40% of children in
 Nigeria aged 12–24 months were underim-
 munised and unimmunised, respectively. 5 A 
<section> fully immunised child is defined as one who received one
 Bacille Calmette─Guerin (BCG), three pentavalent (ie,
 diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type
 B and hepatitis B), one yellow fever and measles vaccine
 within the first year of life. The third dose of the pentava-
 lent vaccine (Penta-3) is the global benchmark for vaccine
 reporting. To meet the 2020 Global Vaccine Action Plan
 targets, interventions that are innovative, cost-effective,
 region and country specific are needed.
 In high-income countries, immunisation reminders
 through automated or real-time text and or calls improve
 immunisation uptake and completion. 6 According to the
 Nigerian National Immunization Coverage Survey report,
 lack of awareness of recommendations for a child’s
 immunisation is the biggest reason for not completing
 the immunisation series─accounting for 42% of the
 reported barriers. 5 With high mobile phone penetration
 in Nigeria and other SSA countries, phone reminders
 have the potential to help overcome this barrier.
 Evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
 conducted in urban areas of Zimbabwe, Nigeria and
 Burkina Faso suggest text reminders alone improve
 immunisation completion and timeliness. 7–9 However,
 a recent RCT from rural Kenya contradicts these find-
 ings. 10 In this study, text message alone did not improve
 immunisation completion, but improved timeliness of
 vaccine receipt. Only when text reminders were paired
 with a higher monetary incentive did completion rates
 improve. 10 Text reminders assume the recipient is literate
 enough to read and understand the message. However,
 38% of African adults (some 153 million) are illiter-
 ate─two-thirds of these being women. 11 Adult literacy is
 often lower in rural compared with urban areas. 12 13 This
 may account for the difference in effectiveness—an indi-
 cation that text reminders alone are not appropriate in
 this setting. In a study from a rural community in Nigeria,
 the use of manual phone call immunisation reminders
 significantly improved immunisation completion─a 41%
 increase from controls. 14 However, this method is time
 and human resource dependent and unlikely to garner
 national application. With literacy being a limitation in
 some areas, automated audible reminders in the native
 languages may provide added benefit to text reminders.
 We conducted the Phone Reminder for Immunisation
 (PRIMM) trial to test the feasibility and effect of pairing
 automated text and call reminders on immunisation
 completion in a semi-rural setting in Nigeria. We hypoth-
 esised that the Penta-3 vaccine and the completion of the
 childhood immunisation series assessed at 12 months of
 age would significantly improve with this intervention.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> A two-arm parallel RCT was conducted at the Mother
 and Child Hospital Ondo Town (MCH-Ondo) and Akure
 (MCH-Akure), in Ondo State, Nigeria. The conduct,
 analysis and reporting of results are in accordance with
 the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guide-
 lines for reporting parallel group randomised trials.
 The Nigerian government provides routine childhood
 immunisation at no cost to recipients. Government-run
 immunisation clinics are locations where vaccines are
 routinely received. Dictated by the national programme
 on immunisation, 16 the routine immunisation schedule
 in Ondo State, Nigeria is as follows:
 
<section> ► ► Birth: BCG, hepatitis B virus and oral polio vaccine
 (OPV-0).
 
<section> ► ► Six weeks: Penta-1, OPV-1, pneumococcal conjugate
 vaccine (PCV-1) and rotavirus vaccine (Rota-1).
 
<section> ► ► Ten weeks: Penta-2, OPV-2, Rota-2 and PCV-2.
 
<section> ► ► Fourteen weeks: Penta-3, OPV-3, PCV-3 and inacti-
 vated polio vaccine (IPV).
 
<section> ► ► Six months: vitamin A.
 
<section> ► ► Nine months: measles and yellow fever vaccine.
 Immunisation clinic record-book audits were planned
 to assess vaccination uptake. However, the study was
 impacted by a hospital workers’ strike lasting 6 weeks (2
 February to 15 March 2017). The strike interrupted enrol-
 ment, immunisation receipt and monitoring. During this
 period, parents sought other government and private
 clinics for immunisations. We therefore amended our
 study protocol to include phone audits for reporting
 of immunisation uptake between weeks 18 and 30 of
 each participant’s study enrolment period. This was to
 limit misclassification of the immunisation endpoint. We
 incorporated the phone call immunisation audit into the
 planned mid-study survey. The applicable ethical review
 bodies approved the amendment.
 
<section> Study participants and setting
 Parturient women and their healthy newborn infants
 delivered at MCH-Ondo and Akure were eligible for
 enrolment. We included mothers of healthy newborn
 babies, who owned a mobile phone and planned to attend
 the MCH immunisation clinics. We excluded mothers of
 ill newborns, multiple births and those without mobile
 phones.
 The MCHs are state-run facilities. They provide free
 healthcare services to pregnant women and children
 under age 5, with most patients being middle-income and
 low-income families. Each hospital runs its own immu-
 nisation clinic. Ondo State is in the southwest region
 of Nigeria. The main local language is Yoruba. The
 projected 2016 population size from the 2006 national
 census for Ondo Town and Akure are 389 900 and 486
 300, respectively. 17 The primary occupations of citizens
 include farming, artisanship, trading and public service.
 
<section> Study intervention
 We developed a customised Windows software applica-
 tion (app) designed to send automated voice call text
 and email immunisation reminders. We integrated a
 secure cloud communications platform, called Twilio,
 into the app. Messaging and voice were sent by Twilio
 through the app. Date of birth of the newborn and the 
<section> phone number of the mother and father, when provided,
 were inputed into the app. The immunisation reminders
 were autocalculated from date of birth of the child and
 tailored to the local immunisation schedule. At enrol-
 ment, the registered phone number(s) received a veri-
 fication message. Thereafter, reminders were sent 2 days
 and the day before the scheduled date of the Penta-1,
 2, 3 and measles immunisations at 08:00. Eight sets of
 reminders were sent to each participant. The delivery of
 text and call occurred at the same time. Voicemail service
 was not available during the study period.
 The automated text message reminder was in English.
 The text reminder read, ‘Reminder from MCH–Your baby's
 next immunisation visit is in 2 days (or 1 day as appropriate).
 Immunisation protects your child against killer diseases. Please
 bring your baby for this visit’. The automated call reminder
 was in English and Yoruba. The duration of the call was
 s, had a 5 s delay before starting and expressed the same
 message as the text. It cost US$0.0075 to send a text and
 US$0.015/min for an automated call. There was no cost
 to the recipient. Whether study participants received or
 read the text message and whether participants listened
 to audio messages in its entirety could not accurately be
 determined from our telecommunications platform.
 
<section> Study procedures
 A research assistant at each site assessed mothers daily
 in the postpartum ward for eligibility. We systemati-
 cally recorded the number of screened women and the
 reason for exclusion; however, due to a clerical error at
 MCH-Ondo, the exact numbers and reasons are unavail-
 able.
 In developing the study protocol, we took into consid-
 eration that the shortest interval between the pentava-
 lent vaccines is 3 weeks. In Nigeria, the immunisation
 schedule allows for only 4 weeks between Penta-1 and 2,
 and between Penta-2 and 3. 18 We anticipated a potential
 stacking of reminders, and immunisation ineligibility, if
 there was any delay in receiving a scheduled immunisa-
 tion greater than 1 week. Hence, a priori, we determined
 the reminders for Penta-2 and 3 would be recalculated
 from the date the Penta-1 and 2 were administered,
 respectively. For those who did not receive either Penta-1
 and or 2, the Penta-2 and 3 reminders were sent 2 weeks
 after the Penta-1 and 2 were past due, respectively. We
 performed daily audits of the immunisation clinic record
 book. When vaccines were received later than expected,
 the vaccine receipt date was used to calculate the next
 scheduled vaccine accordingly.
 A child-health immunisation card, which listed the
 ages when a child was to receive his/her immunisa-
 tion, comprised standard care. The intervention group
 received the automated text and call reminder plus stan-
 dard care, while the control group received only stan-
 dard care.
 We obtained data for the primary outcome from
 immunisation clinic record books maintained at immu-
 nisation clinics and during the mid-study phone survey
 of all participants. Study research assistants called each
 study participant on the telephone and obtained verbal
 reports─name and date─of when Penta-1, 2 and 3 were
 received. We assessed the receipt of measles vaccine
 solely from the immunisation clinic record book. This
 was because the health workers’ strike did not affect the
 receipt or monitoring of the measles immunisation. We
 did not physically audit the child-health immunisation
 card given to parents and caregivers.
 
<section> Study outcome
 The primary outcome was the proportion of infants who
 received the Penta-1, 2 and 3 immunisations (henceforth
 referred to as Penta-3) at 18 weeks of age. The adminis-
 tration of BCG vaccination occurs at hospital discharge.
 Our intervention did not influence BCG receipt, and so
 it was not included in our primary outcome. We defined
 the secondary outcomes as completing Penta-3 and the
 measles immunisation by 12 months of age and receiving
 each within 1 week of the recommended time.
 We assessed feasibility by the proportion of participants
 who received the verification text and call at enrolment,
 as well as those who reported receiving the reminders
 during the mid-study survey. Additionally, using a socio-
 ecological framework, we designed and administered a
 pre-study survey to assess sociodemographic characteris-
 tics of the mothers. We categorised the survey questions
 into maternal demographics, knowledge about and atti-
 tude towards immunisations, mothers’ health and health-
 seeking behaviour, household demographic construct
 and access to health facility and health information
 related to immunisation. The mid-study survey was to
 assess acceptability of the intervention, perception of
 phone reminders by both groups and perceived barriers
 to completing immunisations.
 
<section> Randomisation and blinding
 Mother–infant dyad assignments to study groups in a 1:1
 ratio was by a permuted randomisation scheme, 19 using
 balanced random blocks of 6, 8 or 10. We stratified the
 randomisation by study site to account for centre popu-
 lation differences.
 Randomisation was done in May 2016 at The Children’s
 Hospital of Philadelphia. Allocation assignments were
 stored in sealed opaque envelopes and mailed via courier
 to the local study principal investigators. Only after
 obtaining written informed consent did the local study
 teams know the allocation assignment. Neither study
 participants nor research team were blinded. However,
 the immunisation clinic staff─those who administered
 and recorded immunisation─were blinded to study
 group allocations.
 
<section> Sample size and statistical methods
 Based on audits of the 2015 MCH-Ondo immunisation
 records and statewide reports, the baseline Penta-3
 completion rate estimate was 75%. To account for a 10%
 loss to follow-up, we needed 300 mother–infant dyads in 
<section> each study arm to have a statistical power of 80% and
 an alpha level of 0.05, to detect a 10% difference in the
 primary outcome. We deemed this 10% difference to be
 of public health importance.
 With the protocol amendment, we defined two study
 populations for the primary outcome analysis. First, a
 modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population─defined
 as all randomised subjects regardless of where immuni-
 sation was received or audited—immunisation record
 books or phone calls. The second was the per-protocol
 (PP) population─defined as all subjects who received
 immunisations only at MCH-Ondo or Akure and had
 immunisation receipt audited solely from the immunisa-
 tion clinic record books.
 We compared demographic characteristics and post-
 study survey variables between study groups using stan-
 dard descriptive statistics. We used two-sample t-test or
 Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and χ
 test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Risk
 ratios and risk difference were calculated for the primary
 and secondary outcomes. In a post hoc analysis, we used a
 generalised linear model for binomial distributions with
 ‘log’ link function to examine the association of selected
 demographic characteristics by study group on immuni-
 sation completion at 12 months. The selected variables
 were based on demographic factors reported in the liter-
 ature to influence immunisation completion. 5 10 20–22 We
 tested interaction effects of the demographic factors with
 the study group and report the p values for the interac-
 tion effects. Results are expressed as risk ratio along with
 their corresponding 95% CIs. Data were analysed using
 Stata V.15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA)
 with a two-sided significance level of 0.05.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> We enrolled 250 mother–infant dyads from MCH-Ondo
 and 350 from Akure between August 2016 and June 2018.
 Five (0.8%) infants died during the follow-up period,
 (8%) were lost to follow-up for the primary outcome
 and 184 (31%) for the 12-month outcomes (figure),
 while 155 (26%) received the Penta-3 immunisation at a
 different clinic.
 
<section> Characteristics of study subjects
 Infant and maternal demographic information were
 similar in both groups (table 1). Newborns were 48%
 female; the mean (SD) birth weight was 3040 g (485) and
 median (IQR) gestational age at birth was 38 (37─38)
 weeks, respectively (table 1). The majority of mothers
 were aged 18–35 years (88%), married (98%), and had
 a university (58%) or secondary education (39%). There
 were no differences in maternal knowledge about and
 attitude towards immunisation, mothers’ health and
 health-seeking behaviour, household demographics or
 access to health facility and health information related to
 immunisation (table 1).
 
<section> Primary and secondary analyses
 For the Penta-3 completion, there was no significant
 difference between the intervention and control groups
 in either the mITT population assessed at 18 weeks (86%
 vs 81%, risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; p=0.15)
 (table 2), 12 months (online supplementary table 1 and
 figure) or in the PP population (91% vs 88%, RR 1.03,
 95% CI 0.97 to 1.10; p=0.37) (online supplementary
 table 2). The proportion of infants who completed the
 12-month immunisation series was significantly higher in
 the intervention compared with the control group (74%
 vs 66%, RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.25; p=0.03) (table 2).
 To achieve completion of the immunisation series for one
 infant, 12.5 parents would need to receive the call and
 text message reminders. The proportion of infants who
 received the Penta-3 and measles immunisation within
 week of the expected date was also significantly higher in
 the intervention compared with the control groups (84%
 vs 78%, RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.17, p=0.04 and 73% vs
 65%, RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.26, p=0.02, respectively)
 (table 3). Those who collectively received all immu-
 nisations within a week of the expected date were also
 significantly higher in the intervention compared with
 the control group (57% vs 47%, RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04 to
 1.43; p=0.01) (table 3). In the post hoc subgroup analysis,
 there was no difference in the immunisation rates by the
 selected demographic variables assessed (table 4).
 
<section> Feasibility, acceptability of intervention and barriers to
 completing immunisation assessed during the mid-study
 
<section> survey
 
<section> At enrolment, 277 (92%) of those in the intervention
 group received a confirmatory text and call. Failed
 delivery resulted from poor local telecommunication
 service. It affected either internet or mobile phone
 connectivity. The mid-study survey was completed by
 276 (92%) and 281 (94%) subjects in the control and
 intervention groups, respectively. In the intervention
 group, 86% reported they received reminders at least
 once during the study period. Twenty-five mothers (13%)
 reported receiving a partial or an unclear text reminder.
 Sixty-six per cent thought the text and calls were overall
 useful in reminding them of their child’s appointment
 and 78% reported it reminded them all or some of the
 time of appointment dates.
 Based on the survey data, the biggest reported barriers
 to completing immunisations were long wait times in
 (55%) and transportation cost in 187 (34%). Forgetful-
 ness (12; 2.2%) was one of the least reported barriers
 to completing the routine immunisation series (online
 supplementary tables 3 and 4).

 the immunisation schedule. For the primary outcome,
 however, Penta-3 completion rates were higher than
 anticipated in both groups and not significantly different
 between groups.
 For the Penta-3 completion, our findings differ from
 trials where text messages reminders alone were used in
 urban SSA settings, 7–9 but are similar to a trial in rural
 Kenya. 10 This may indicate that low literacy may not
 account for the lack of effectiveness of text reminders.
 An inappropriate study population may also explain
 this difference. Although we did not assess literacy level
 directly, 58% and 39% of our study participants had at
 least some university or secondary education, respectively.
 Lack of ‘awareness’ ranks highest among barriers to
 immunisation completion reported by the Nigerian
 National Immunization Survey. 5 The relatively high
 awareness among the standard of care group in our
 study may reflect above-average site-specific counselling.
 Cost of transportation, distance to and overall ‘condu-
 civeness’ at the clinics were the most frequent barriers
 to immunisation in our study population. These barriers
 have also been reported in trials conducted in Kenya and
 Nigeria. 8 22 Furthermore, they have attracted research
 interest from organisations like the Bill and Melinda
 Gates foundation in recent years.
 Findings from a study in rural Nigeria where real-
 time phone call immunisation reminders significantly
 improved immunisation completion premised our intent
 to use automated calls. 14 The Nigeria study found a 41%
 increase in immunisation completion. 14 Our intervention
 also resulted in improvements in immunisation comple-
 tion at 12 months, with a smaller effect. Methodological

 differences may explain effect size differences. While
 our study sent out two reminder calls 2 days and the day
 before the immunisation due date, the prior published
 study used two real-time reminder phone calls plus four
 recalls if immunisations were missed as the primary
 intervention. 14 Furthermore, and likely of importance, is
 the absence of the human element in automated calls.
 The ability to empathise, counsel and reassure mothers
 during a real-time phone call is lost with automation.
 However, with current resource and organisational
 limitations, real-time phone calls plus recalls is time and
 human resource dependent and likely to result in a high
 implementation cost. Taking it to scale and sustenance
 will also be a challenge. Since most studies where text was
 used yielded between 60% and 80% completion rates,
 automated text and/or calls could serve as a first-pass
 reminder to be followed by real-time phone calls when
 immunisations are delayed. This may prove to be a more 
<section> cost-effective strategy. Digital immunisation registries
 can potentially improve the efficiency of this process by
 simplifying identification of defaulters.
 In our study, we demonstrated modest feasibility insti-
 tuting a customised automated text and call immunisa-
 tion reminder system. However, poor phone and internet
 connectivity resulted in 8% delivery failure at enrolment.
 Furthermore, only 86% reported receiving at least one
 set of reminders during the study period. Phones that
 were switched off or had poor reception when messages
 were sent were the most common reported reasons for
 not receiving phone reminders. This is a limitation in
 web-based text and call systems which lack the ability to
 queue messages until the switched off phone is turned
 back on or a phone in poor reception areas moves to
 an area with better reception. In addition, voicemail is
 uncommon in these settings. We speculate that a system
 that uses the available local telecommunication network,
 which is usually more redundant, and has the capacity to
 provide more accurate log data, may yield better results.
 Our study had some limitations. A 2015 institutional
 audit and state reported Penta-3 completion rates
 informed our sample size estimation. This likely under-
 estimated the true institutional completion for those
 committed to receiving their immunisations at only
 MCH clinic. Furthermore, we introduced selection bias
 by recruiting only parents who planned for their child to
 receive immunisations only at MCH. Ondo state govern-
 ment during the study period provided free maternal
 care. Women in lower socioeconomic classes may have
 been those who lived further away and only used MCH
 for its free services. However, this was necessary to allow
 us to ascertain our intended primary outcome (immu-
 nisations confirmed by clinic records). The inclusion of
 women who own phones limits the generalisation of our
 results. Another limitation was the workers’ strike. Unfor-
 tunately, this reflects a common reality in SSA and a need
 to strengthen the healthcare system. We were, however,
 able to retain 92% of the enrolled population for the
 primary outcome. Due to a clerical error, the number of
 subjects who refused or were ineligible for the study at
 MCH-Ondo could not be determined (figure). Another
 limitation is our inability to access reminder messaging
 log from our web-based platform. This is a limitation in
 most similar trials from SSA with only one trial reporting
 log data. 10 Finally, although we intended to overcome
 low literacy levels by adding voice call reminders, 97% of
 study participants had at least secondary education.
 The strengths of our study include a randomisation
 strategy that resulted in balanced demographic charac-
 teristics between study groups. We also used a more prac-
 tical approach to study participant’s message receipt as a
 proxy to assess feasibility.
 
<section> Conclusions
 In a semi-rural region in Nigeria, the implementation
 of an automated text and call immunisation system was
 modestly feasible. The phone reminders significantly
 improved immunisation completion and timeliness. This
 study adds to the growing evidence of the effectiveness of
 phone reminders in SSA. Factors such as transportation
 cost, distance to and overall ‘immunisation clinic condu-
 civeness’ were the most frequently reported barriers
 to immunisation. Combining reminder systems with
 innovative solutions capable of improving access to and
 efficiency of immunisation clinics are likely to improve
 immunisation uptake and completion in Nigeria and
 other SSA countries.
