<section> ABSTRACT
 
<section> Introduction Measles vaccine (MV) may improve health
 beyond measles protection. To avoid wastage from multi-­dose
 vials, children in Guinea-­Bissau are only measles vaccinated
 when aged 9–11 months and when six or more children are
 present. We assessed health impacts of providing MV to all
 measles-­unvaccinated children 9–35 months.
 
<section> Methods We cluster-­randomised 182 village clusters under
 demographic surveillance in rural Guinea-­Bissau to an ‘MV-­
 for-­all-­policy’ arm where we offered MV regardless of age
 and number of children present at our bi-­annual village visits,
 or a ‘Restrictive-­MV-­policy’ arm where we followed national
 policy. Measles-­unvaccinated children aged 9–35 months
 were eligible for enrolment and followed to 5 years of age.
 In intention-­to-­treat analyses, we compared mortality using
 Cox regression analyses with age as underlying timescale.
 The primary analysis was for children aged 12–35 months at
 eligibility assessment. Interactions with several background
 factors were explored.
 
<section> Results Between 2011 and 2016, we followed 2778
 children in the primary analysis. MV coverage by 3 years
 was 97% among children eligible for enrolment under the
 MV-­for-­all-­policy, and 48% under the Restrictive-­MV-­policy.
 Mortality was 59% lower than anticipated and did not
 differ by trial arm (MV-­for-­all-­policy: 45/1405: Restrictive-­
 
<section> MV-­policy: 44/1373; HR: 0.95 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.43)).
 The effect of MV-­for-­all changed over time: The HR was
 0.53 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.07) during the first 1½ years of
 enrolment but 1.47 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.50) later (p=0.02,
 test of interaction). Explorative analyses indicated that the
 temporal change may be related to interactions with other
 childhood interventions.
 
<section> Conclusion The MV-­for-­all-­policy increased MV coverage
 but had no overall effect on overall mortality.
 
<section> Trial registration number NCT01306006.
 
<section> INTRODUCTION
 In many low-­income countries, measles vaccines
 (MV) are provided at 9 months of age according
 to the schedule outlined by the WHO. 1 A second
 dose is recommended during the second year of
 life, either through a scheduled second MV or
 through campaigns.

<section> of measles
 
<section> trial
 
<section> Rodrigues,
 
<section> 1,2,3
 
<section> Key questions
 
<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► Two randomised trials and several observational
 studies indicate that measles vaccination lowers
 mortality.
 
<section> ► A policy of only vaccinating children aged less than
 12 months and only vaccinating if more than six
 children were due to be vaccinated was practiced
 in Guinea-­Bissau.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► Making measles vaccine (MV) available at biannual
 village visits increased the coverage by 3 years of
 age to 97% compared with 48% in the control arm.
 
<section> ► Providing MV for all had no overall effect on mor-
 tality (HR: 0.95 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.43)) but the effect
 changed during the trial period from an HR of 0.53
 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.07) during the first 1½ years of
 enrolment to 1.47 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.50) among chil-
 dren enrolled later (p=0.02, test of interaction).
 
<section> ► Explorative analyses indicated that the change in
 effect over time may be explained by differential ex-
 posure to other vaccines.
 
<section> What do the new findings imply?
 
<section> ► The restrictive measles vaccination policy left many
 children unvaccinated and disregarding it (in line
 with recommendations by WHO) increases coverage
 and presumably improves measles control.
 
<section> ► Beneficial effects of MV may be contingent on the
 number and sequence of other vaccines.
 
<section> In Guinea-­Bissau in West Africa, the offi-
 cial country estimate for MV coverage in
 2011 was 78%, 3 and thus far from the recom-
 mended coverage target of ≥90% necessary to
 obtain measles control. 2 Although childhood
 vaccines are provided free of charge at health
 centres and through outreach services, there
 are significant barriers to measles vaccina-
 tion. Among others, we have identified the
 focus on vaccine wastage as a major barrier.
 Vaccination coverage for vaccines scheduled 
<section> during infancy is assessed by 12 months of age. Providing
 vaccines to children older than 12 months of age does
 not count in the statistics and is considered wastage.
 Furthermore, since MV is a live vaccine typically provided
 in 10-­dose vials, which has to be discarded 6 hours after
 opening, the focus on wastage has entailed that children
 in Guinea-­Bissau are only measles vaccinated if at least
 six children aged 9–11 months are present at the same
 time. Hence, this ‘restrictive vial opening policy’ results
 in missed opportunities, and fewer measles vaccinated
 children.
 Several observational studies 5–7 and two randomised
 trials 8 9 from Guinea-­Bissau indicate that measles vacci-
 nation reduces childhood mortality and morbidity to a
 much larger extent than can be expected by preventing
 measles infection. These potential ‘non-­specific effects’
 (NSEs) of MV were recently examined in a WHO-­
 sponsored literature review which concluded that the
 marked benefits observed in both randomised trials and
 observational studies could not be explained by preven-
 tion of measles. 10 Thus, the restrictive vial opening policy
 both deprives children of protection against measles
 infection and of the beneficial NSEs of MV.
 To assess the consequences of the restrictive vial
 policy, we conducted a cluster-­randomised trial in rural
 villages under health and demographic surveillance.
 We randomised villages to either follow or disregard the
 national measles vaccination policy during the surveil-
 lance visits. In the national measles vaccination policy
 arm, the ‘Restrictive-­MV-­policy’-arm, we only vaccinated
 children 9–11 months of age and only if six or more chil-
 dren were present at the same time. In the ‘MV-­for-­all-­
 policy’-arm, we provided MV to all measles-­unvaccinated
 children between 9 and 35 months of age, regardless of age
 and number of children present at a vaccination session.
 We hypothesised that among measles unvaccinated chil-
 dren aged 12–35 months, mortality before 5 years of age
 would be 30% lower in the ‘MV-­for-­all-­policy’-arm.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Setting
 
<section> The cluster-­randomised trial ‘MVEPI’ was conducted in
 Bandim Health Project’s (BHP) health and demographic
 surveillance system (HDSS) in rural Guinea-­Bissau. The
 BHP follows 182 clusters of approximately 100 women of
 fertile age and their children under 5 years of age in the
 nine rural health regions of Guinea-­Bissau. 11 The clus-
 ters are routinely visited every 6 months by BHP mobile
 teams registering new pregnancies and children; for all
 children information on vaccination status is collected
 (online supplemental material).
 
<section> Trial design and randomisation
 The 182 rural clusters were randomised 1:1 to either
 ‘MV-­for-­all-­policy’ or ‘Restrictive-­MV-­policy’ stratified
 by region and pretrial mortality rates (online supple-
 mental material). The implications of the randomisation
 differed for 9–11-­month-­old children and older children.
 Among older children, all unvaccinated children in the
 MV-­for-­all-­policy clusters received MV, and no child in
 the Restrictive-­MV-­policy clusters received MV. Among
 the 9–11-­month-­old children, children in the MV-­for-­all-­
 policy clusters received MV irrespective of the number of
 measles-­unvaccinated children in the cluster, whereas in
 Restrictive-­MV-­policy clusters, only 9–11-­month-­old chil-
 dren in clusters with at least six 9–11 months old measles-­
 unvaccinated children present, received MV.
 We planned the following analyses: first, an intention-­
 to-­treat analysis among all measles-­unvaccinated children
 aged 12–35 months (main analysis) as well as all children
 aged 9–35 months (the population of 12–35 months old
 children was the basis for our sample size calculation).
 Second, a per-­protocol analysis, including only children
 presenting at the vaccination post and deemed eligible
 for vaccination. Furthermore, in a third analysis, we
 aimed to assess the community level impact of MV-­for-­all
 among all children living in the HDSS villages from the
 first day they could potentially have been enrolled.
 We based our initial sample size calculations on a
 hypothesised halving of mortality 8 but based on emerging
 evidence updated it to a 30% reduction (online supple-
 mental material). Assuming that providing MV-­ for-­ all
 would lower overall mortality by 30% between enrolment
 and 5 years of age, that 8% of follow-­up time would be
 censured due to migration, a cluster size of 17, interclass
 correlation coefficient of 0.5% and a registered pre-­trial
 mortality of 8.3%, we had planned to enrol 3676 children
 in the age group 12–35 months.
 
<section> Enrolment
 
<section> The trial was initiated in February 2011 and enrolment
 ended in December 2015 when a national measles vacci-
 nation campaign was conducted. Measles-­unvaccinated
 children aged 9–35 months of age were eligible for
 the trial. During the bi-­annual visits to the clusters by
 the BHP mobile teams, mothers/guardians of measles-­
 unvaccinated children between 9 and 35 months of age
 were identified by trained BHP fieldworkers and inter-
 viewed on experiences with seeking MV. The study design
 and purpose of the MVEPI study was explained to the
 mother/guardian. If they were interested in participating
 in the study, the mother/guardian and child were sent to
 the health post, where the BHP nurse performed a health
 check of the child (online supplemental material). Chil-
 dren in the Restrictive-­MV-­policy clusters were vaccinated
 at the health post if six or more measles-­unvaccinated
 children aged 9–11 months were present at the same
 time. In the MV-­for-­all clusters, all measles-­unvaccinated
 children aged 9–35 months at the time of the visit were
 measles vaccinated by the BHP regardless of number of
 children present. Only children who were not acutely
 ill, had a mid upper-­arm circumference (MUAC) >110
 mm and had not received a live vaccine within the last
 days were vaccinated. Written consent was sought from
 the mother/guardian of children older than 12 months

 who were vaccinated, as this is not standard practice in
 Guinea-­ Bissau. The MV (Edmonston-­ Zagreb, Serum
 Institute of India) was administered as a deep subcuta-
 neous injection in the subscapular region.
 Until July 2012, we enrolled children aged 9–35 months
 in all villages of the rural Bandim HDSS. In 2012, we initi-
 ated a randomised trial of an additional early MV in three
 of the regions 12 and paused enrolments for the MVEPI
 trial in these regions for 14 months (online supplemental
 material).
 
<section> Follow-up
 
<section> All children followed in the MVEPI trial, were surveyed
 through the routine BHP surveillance system bi-­annually
 until their fifth birthday, migration or death. At every
 bi-­annual follow-­up visit, information on vital status and
 admissions to hospital was collected and MUAC meas-
 ured. The reason for loss to follow-­up and date of the
 event was noted by the BHP field workers. Registered
 hospital admissions and deaths were followed by an inter-
 view on the circumstances, symptoms, possible diagnosis
 and dates.
 
<section> Statistical analyses
 To assess the impact of an MV-­for-­all-­policy, all analyses were
 based on measles-­unvaccinated children eligible for enrol-
 ment in the MVEPI study (intention-­to-­treat-­analyses). Since
 the implication of the policy differed for children above
 and below 12 months of age, the primary analysis was based
 on the intention-­to-­treat population of children aged ≥12
 months of age. Children aged 9–11 months were analysed
 combined with ≥12 months old children in secondary anal-
 yses. We compared sociodemographic and baseline health
 variables for children eligible for enrolment in the MV-­for-­
 all-­policy arm with children eligible for enrolment in the
 Restrictive-­MV-­policy arm.
 We assessed the impact of living in MV-­for-­all-­policy clus-
 ters on mortality from the date of eligibility assessment.
 We censored the observation time for children at the
 date of the first event of either: their fifth birthday, death
 (or first hospital admission, see below), migration or first
 visit after a new MV-­campaign trial initiated by the BHP
 in November 2016. 13 HRs were estimated in Cox propor-
 tional hazards models with age as the underlying times-
 cale, stratified by randomisation strata (region and high/
 low pretrial mortality) and used robust SE to account for
 village cluster. Proportional hazards assumptions were
 tested using Schoenfeld residuals. In the supplementary
 results, we show a per-­protocol analysis, including only
 children who were enrolled in the MVEPI trial and the
 results on the community level, including all children
 who were visited at 9–35 months of age (figure 1).
 In addition, we assessed the impact of the MV-­ for-­
 all-­policy on the risk of hospital admission and MUAC
 measured at the first visit after enrolment (online supple-
 mental material). Main results are presented overall and
 separately for girls and boys since prior analyses have
 indicated that the beneficial effect of MV is stronger in
 girls than boys. 5 8 14–16
 To assess the effect of the MV-­ for-­ all-­ policy on MV
 coverage and to investigate whether children in the
 Restrictive-­ MV-­ policy arm were vaccinated elsewhere
 after 4 enrolment, we assessed MV coverage by 36 months
 of age. We did so among all children with a seen vaccina-
 tion card after 36 months and among children fulfilling
 the eligibility criteria. We report coverage by study arm
 and age at enrolment.
 For the mortality outcome, we conducted several anal-
 yses to investigate determinants of the effect. Vaccination
 campaigns during follow-­up may change the effect of
 the trial-­intervention as a new vaccine becomes the most
 recent vaccine in both intervention and control arm.
 In prespecified analyses, we therefore examined whether
 campaigns affected the mortality rate and modified the
 effect of living in MV-­for-­all villages. To do so, we split
 the follow-­up time at the date of eligibility to vaccination
 campaigns during follow-­ up. A resulting dummy vari-
 able (before/after the time-­split) was investigated as a
 potential effect modifier. Two national MV campaigns,
 several oral polio vaccination (OPV) campaigns and one
 campaign with the meningitis A vaccine (MenAfriVac)
 took place while children were followed in the trial
 (online supplemental table 1 and figure 1). 
<section> In explorative analyses, we stratified the analyses for
 factors that in prior studies have been associated with
 a differential effect of MV. The assessed background
 factors were: season of vaccination, 18 eligibility for (likely
 received) campaign-­MV before enrolment 19 20 and admin-
 istration of pentavalent vaccine (Penta) at the time of
 enrolment. 21 Since almost all children had been eligible
 for OPV campaigns prior to enrolment, we performed
 stratified analyses by number of OPV campaigns rather
 than by yes/no to campaign exposure. 22 We furthermore
 explored whether the effect differed by number of doses
 of Penta and whether effects changed before and after
 initiating the early MV trial, where all children below
 months of age were offered MV regardless of the number
 of children present. 12 For the potential effect modi-
 fiers, we investigated interactions by including a trial-­
 arm*potential effect modifier-­term in the Cox model,
 and report the p value from the corresponding Wald test.
 Unless a stratification criterion applies only to limited age
 group, these analyses are presented for all children. All
 analyses were performed in STATA V.16.1 (StataCorp).

 and conduct of this research.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Study cohorts
 A total of 22 749 children 9–35 months of age, were recorded
 in the BHP databases and sought visited between 2011 and
 2015. Four thousand seven hundred and sixty-­seven were
 eligible for inclusion in the MVEPI trial at date of visit to
 the villages (2339 in the Restrictive-­MV-­policy arm and 2428
 in the MV-­for-­all-­policy arm) (the main (intention-­to-­treat)
 analysis) and 4437 (93%) were seen at the enrolment post
 and fulfilled the criteria for vaccination (per-­protocol anal-
 ysis). In the Restrictive-­MV-­policy arm, 88 of 2174 children
 (4%) seen at the vaccination post were measles vaccinated
 at the date of enrolment according to national policy, as
 they were between 9 and 11 months old and six and more
 children were present. In the MV-­for-­all-­policy arm, this was
 2232 of 2263 (99%; figure 1).
 
<section> Background characteristics
 Table 1 displays the characteristics of children eligible for
 inclusion. More than half (2778, 58%) were aged 12–35
 months on eligibility assessment. Our randomisation
 achieved balanced groups for most of the assessed factors
 including age, sex, maternal age, maternal schooling, indi-
 cators of socioeconomic status and prior vaccinations both
 among children aged 12–35 months and among all chil-
 dren. Children in the MV-­for-­all-­policy clusters were more
 likely to receive a missed dose of Penta at eligibility assess-
 ment (table 1). Region of residence and ethnicity of the
 mother also differed by trial arm. For children who were
 not enrolled as they had already received MV, there were
 no marked differences in mortality between the MV-­for-­all
 clusters and the Restrictive-­MV-­policy clusters during the
 same period of follow-­up (online supplemental material).
 
<section> Intervention results
 The intervention had a marked effect on MV coverage.
 Among children with a vaccination card inspected after
 3 years of age, the vaccination coverage for MV was
 85% (6185/7284) for children living in the Restrictive-­
 MV-­ policy clusters while it was 96% (7269/7568) in
 the MV-­ for-­ all clusters. Among the initially measles-­
 unvaccinated children, less than a third of the children
 12 months or older in the Restrictive-­MV-­policy arm, had
 received a routine MV by 3 years of age (figure 2).
 Among the 2778 children aged 12–35 months when
 eligible for enrolment, we registered 89 deaths before
 years of age during a median follow-­up of 2.8 years (IQR:
 2.0–3.6 years). This corresponded to a mortality of 3.4%
 or 12/1000 person years, which was less than half of the
 anticipated rate based on prior data on which we had
 based our sample size calculation. There were no differ-
 ences in mortality for children living in the MV-­for-­all
 versus Restrictive-­ MV-­ policy clusters (HR: 0.95 (95%
 CI 0.64 to 1.43)) (figure 3, table 2). This was also seen
 among all children (HR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.44))
 (table 2), in the per-­protocol analyses (online supple-
 mental table 2) and the community level analysis (online
 supplemental material).
 The effects tended to differ for boys and girls (table 2).
 Among 12–35 months old girls, living in the MV-­for-­all
 clusters was associated with a tendency towards higher
 mortality compared with living in the Restrictive-­ MV-­
 policy clusters (HR: 1.20 (95% CI 0.63 to 2.27), while the
 HR was 0.78 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.45) for boys aged 12–35
 months (p=0.39 for interaction). The same pattern was
 observed among children aged 9–11 months. Hence,
 though not statistically significant the sex-­ differential
 effects became more pronounced in the combined anal-
 ysis of all children (boys: HR=0.79 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.25);
 girls: HR=1.43 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.35); p=0.10 for interac-
 tion). Repeating the analyses with time since eligibility
 assessment as underlying timescale, resolved a potential
 problem of non-­proportional hazards and did not alter
 conclusions (online supplemental material).
 
<section> Other outcomes: hospital admissions, nutritional status and
 
<section> MV coverage
 
<section> There were fewer hospital admissions than deaths both
 among children aged ≥12 months (n=61) and among all
 children (n=133). We observed no difference in the hospital
 admission rates between the two trial arms for children aged
 12–35 months (HR=1.09 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.79)). Nor was
 there any difference among all children and no marked
 differences by sex (online supplemental table 3).
 No differences in MUAC at the first visit after assess-
 ment for eligibility were seen between the two groups,
 except for boys aged 9–11 months living in MV-­for-­
 all-­p olicy villages, where there was a slight but statisti-
 cally significant lower MUAC (143 mm) than among

<section> Prespecified stratified analyses of mortality effects:
 interactions with other interventions
 Vaccination campaigns during follow-­up may change the
 effect of the trial-­intervention as a new vaccine becomes
 the most recent vaccine in both intervention and control
 arm. 17 We examined whether campaigns affected
 the mortality rate and modified the effect of living in
 MV-­for-­all villages. When splitting the follow-­up time into
 before and after MV campaigns, the mortality rate among
 children aged 12–35 months differed, the HR for after
 versus before MV campaigns being 0.45 (95% CI 0.28 to
 0.75). The HR for after versus before OPV campaigns was
 
<section> 0.81 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.45) and the HR for after versus
 before the MenAfriVac campaign was 1.11 (95% CI 0.48
 to 2.58).
 Splitting the follow-­ u p time of children eligible
 for enrolment into before and after the MV or OPV
 campaigns, showed no marked differences between
 the two trial arms. However, among all children, the
 HR for MV-­f or-­a ll was 0.97 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.34) prior
 to the MenAfriVac campaign but 2.42 (95% CI 0.89
 to 6.60) after the campaign (p=0.09 for interaction)
 (online supplemental table 5). The potential nega-
 tive effect tended to be more pronounced in girls
 (HR=5.77 (95% CI 0.68 to 48.39)) than boys (1.58
 (95% CI 0.43 to 5.79)).

<section> Explorative analyses
 In explorative analyses, we assessed if the effect varied
 over time and by factors which in prior trials have proved
 important for the effect of MV. Among children with
 eligibility assessment in the rainy season, living in the
 MV-­for-­all clusters tended to be associated with higher
 mortality compared with living in the Restrictive-­ MV-­
 policy clusters (HR=1.35 (95% CI 0.72 to 2.53)), whereas
 children with eligibility assessment in the dry season
 tended to benefit from living in the MV-­for all clusters,
 HR=0.69 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.21), p=0.13 for a differential
 effect. The tendencies were similar when the analysis was
 extended to all children (online supplemental table 6)
 and for hospital admissions (online supplemental table
 3).
 When analysed by enrolment period, the effect differed
 significantly before and after the initiation of the concur-
 rent early MV trial. Among children aged 12–35 months,
 living in the MV-­for-­all villages tended to be beneficial
 (HR=0.53 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.07)) if they were assessed
 for eligibility before 18 July 2012 (period 1), but not after
 (period 2): HR=1.47 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.50) (p=0.02 for
 interaction) (figure 2). Extending the analysis to all chil-
 dren, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.15) in period
 1 and 1.46 (95% CI 0.99 to 2.14) in period, p=0.03 for
 interaction. The differential effect was strongest for girls,
 where the HR changed from 0.38 (95% CI 0.10 to 1.49)
 to 2.15 (95% CI 0.93 to 4.97) (p=0.04) while the HRs for
 boys were 0.63 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.49) and 0.98 (95% CI
 0.42 to 2.30) (online supplemental figure 2). Changing
 the cut-­off date did not alter conclusions (online supple-
 mental material). Since effects differed over time, we
 furthermore assessed if potentially explanatory factors
 changed over time.
 First, previous studies have shown that OPV-­campaigns
 may affect the effect of MV. 22 23 99% (2765/2778) of
 children aged 12–35 months had been exposed to one
 or more OPV campaigns prior to eligibility assessment
 (median number: 3 (IQR: 2–4)). For the younger chil-
 dren aged 9–11 months, 91% (1816/1989) had been
 exposed (median number: 2 (IQR 1–2)) (online supple-
 mental table 7). Children who had been exposed to two
 or fewer campaigns prior to enrolment, tended to have
 higher mortality if they lived in the MV-­for-­all clusters
 than if they lived in the restrictive MV clusters, HR=1.69
 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.95). In contrast, children who had
 been exposed to three or more OPV campaigns bene-
 fitted from living in the MV-­ for-­ all clusters, HR=0.54
 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.97) (p=0.005 for interaction). The
 pattern was similar for all children (table 3). Finer subdi-
 visions of number of doses of campaign OPV indicated
 beneficial effects among children exposed to 3 or 4+
 doses, negative effects in children exposed to 0–1 dose
 (online supplemental figure 3). The differential effect
 was observed in both boys and girls (online supplemental
 figure 3) and may have been stronger after exposure to
 OPV campaigns after enrolment (online supplemental
 table 8).
 In the first period, more children were exposed to
 several OPV campaigns before eligibility assessment
 (online supplemental figures 4 and 5). The median
 number among 12–35 months old children was 4 (IQR:
 3–5), while it was 2 (IQR: 2–3) in the second period.
 The pattern of lower HR for children exposed to ≥3
 campaigns was observed in both periods (online supple-
 mental figure 5).
 As indicated in table 1, Penta administered at enrolment
 differed between the two arms of the study. We therefore
 explored how effects varied by Penta status. Reception
 of Penta at eligibility assessment did not modify effects
 (online supplemental table 9). Among children who had
 not received Penta3 at enrolment, living in the MV-­for-­
 all-­policy villages tended to be beneficial, HR: 0.59 (95%
 CI 0.31 to 1.14) while it was not among children who had
 received Penta3: HR: 1.33 (95% CI 0.77 to 2.31) (p=0.06
 for interaction) (table 4). The differential effect was
 similar in all children (p=0.008 for interaction). Strati-
 fying by doses of Penta indicated a dose–response rela-
 tionship (online supplemental figure 6).

 The Penta3 coverage in children aged 12–35 months
 was higher during period 2 (61%, 941/1551) than
 period 1 (54% (667/1226)) (relative risk adjusted for
 randomisation strata=1.09 (1.02–1.17)). Higher HR with
 increasing number of Pentas was observed throughout
 the trial (online supplemental figure 7).
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> Providing MV-­ for-­ all at our biannual visits resulted in
 a marked increase in MV coverage. More than half of
 the children in the Restrictive-­MV-­policy arm were still
 measles-­unvaccinated by 3 years of age. Therefore, from a
 measles preventive point of view, it is imperative that MV
 is provided to all children regardless of age and number
 of children present. This way the target coverage for
 
<section> MV of ≥90%, set forth by the WHO, may be reached.
 We have previously shown that the Restrictive-­MV-­policy
 entails that mothers take their children several times to
 seek MV—on average 1.4 times, conferring considerable
 costs and time spent on taking the child to the health-
 care facility for MV. 24 The average cost of one MV dose
 in a 10-­dose vial was US$0.279 in 2017 and it is thus one
 of the cheapest vaccines in the national immunisation
 programmes. 25 In comparison, one dose of Penta had a
 price of US$2.25 in 2017. Thus, providing MV for all chil-
 dren is a cheap childhood intervention which is key in
 the strive for measles elimination.
 We found no overall effect on mortality, hospital
 admissions and MUAC for children living in clusters
 randomised to MV-­ for-­ all-­ policy compared with chil-
 dren living in clusters randomised to Restrictive-­ MV-­
 policy. Though the effect tended to differ by exposure to
 routine and campaign vaccines, the lower than expected
 mortality may have limited the power of these analyses.
 Most remarkable, the mortality effect changed from
 being beneficial in the beginning to have negative effects
 in the last part of the trial.
 
<section> Strengths and limitations
 Nesting the trial into the HDSS with bi-­annual household
 visits, allowed for better registration and more precision
 of child age as well as the date of death and migrations.
 Thanks to the HDSS we also had full follow-­up and prior
 data available and could perform stratification of clus-
 ters based on pretrial mortality levels prior to randomi-
 sation. Background factors were generally evenly distrib-
 uted among the two trial arms and we observed similar
 mortality by trial arm among the group of previously

<iend>

 measles vaccinated children who were not eligible for
 trial participation. The clusters under surveillance in
 the rural HDSS have been sampled with a probability
 of sampling proportional to population size, but do not
 include the capital area, where the likelihood that having
 a low number of children present for vaccination would
 be lower. Thus, estimates cannot be extrapolated to the
 whole country.
 Our main outcome was mortality. Due to the regular
 follow-­up of the children, we consider the information 
<section> on this hard end-­point very valid. Even when children
 are travelling, other informants than the mother usually
 provide valid information on the vital status of the child.
 Our secondary outcome, hospital admissions, was based
 on statements made by the mother or another relative,
 but as hospital admissions are rare and major health
 events, we still consider the information reliable (online
 supplemental material).
 The lower than expected mortality during the follow-­up
 period, meant that we did not have the planned power
 to detect a significant difference in mortality if the real
 effect had been as hypothesised (online supplemental
 material). Additionally, there were potentially important
 effect modifiers that we did not have sufficient power to
 examine. Furthermore, the policy was not implemented
 strictly: though children older than 12 months were not
 vaccinated by our teams, 31% of the children aged 12–35
 months in the Restrictive-­MV-­policy clusters had received
 MV during follow-­ up. This may have diminished our
 ability to detect a potential effect of the MV-­for-­all-­policy.
 We have performed many stratified analyses, and
 though the stratification variables are informed by prior
 studies, their number increases the risk of chance find-
 ings. No correction has been made for multiple compar-
 isons and the results of our stratified analyses should be
 interpreted with caution.
 
<section> Consistency with other studies
 Among children who were eligible for enrolment in
 MVEPI in the dry season, both mortality and hospital
 admissions tended to be lower in the MV-­for-­all villages
 than in the Restrictive-­MV-­policy clusters, while it tended
 to be higher in the rainy season. Stronger beneficial
 effects in the dry season have previously been observed
 in a randomised trial of early MV for both mortality 8 and
 admissions.
 Almost all children in the present trial were exposed
 to OPV campaigns prior to enrolment. These campaigns
 may have beneficial effects on overall child mortality 26
 and in a recent trial of two-­dose MV versus one dose MV,
 OPV campaign was associated with a lower mortality,
 particularly among children in the one-­dose MV group
 and with stronger effects for girls. 23 28 Our findings that
 the effects of MV differed by the number of OPV doses,
 with negative effects in children exposed to 1–2 doses,
 but beneficial effects in children exposed to 3+ doses, has
 not been examined previously. In prior studies, we have
 assessed the effect in young children in early MV trials
 who have been exposed to 0, 1 or 2 campaigns, and in
 these observed that the HR increased across additional
 doses of OPV before MV. 22 28 However, the children in
 these trials were much younger and therefore given OPV
 (rather than OPV+vitamin A) and exposed to 2 versus
 dose of MV.
 We have previously observed that children receiving
 additional doses of DTP after MV during follow-­up did
 not benefit from MV. 20 29 In the present trial, we observed
 that children fully vaccinated with the DTP-­containing
 Penta had a negative effect, while children still missing
 doses of Penta benefitted. This has not been examined
 previously.
 MV has been associated with beneficial effects primarily
 for girls. 8 20 However, in this trial, girls in MV-­for-­all-­policy
 clusters had higher mortality than girls in Restrictive-­
 MV-­policy clusters. Our stratified analyses indicate that
 subsequent exposure to MenAfriVac and potentially
 prior exposure to OPV could offer explanations for the
 contrast. Negative effects of vaccination with other non-­
 live vaccines after MV have been observed previously 30
 and negative interactions between OPV and MV may be
 stronger for girls than boys.
 
<section> Interpretation and implications
 We observed an inversion in the effect of the interven-
 tion over time, with the effect shifting from an almost
 50% lower mortality during the first period of the trial
 to an almost 50% higher mortality during the second
 period of the trial. This change in effect was particularly
 marked for girls. We speculate that part of the change in
 effect might be explained by the exposure to the MenA-
 friVac campaign, which could potentially have increased
 mortality in period 2, particularly in the MV-­for-­all-­policy
 clusters and particularly for girls. This presupposes that
 the increased mortality associated with receiving non-­
 live vaccines after MV is generalisable to MenAfriVac.
 However, the NSEs of MenAfriVac have not been inves-
 tigated yet. Our exploratory analyses also identified the
 increase in Penta coverage and differential exposure to
 several OPV campaigns prior to enrolment as potential
 explanations. Both exposure to 0–2 doses of campaigns
 OPV and Penta3 which appeared to cause a negative
 effect of MV-­ for-­ all, were more common in period
 than period 1 and the patterns were consistent within
 period 1 and period 2. Similar patterns were observed for
 both sexes, but the potential negative effects appeared
 stronger in girls than boys (online supplemental figure
 5). The observations were unplanned, and though the
 internal consistency supports causality, we cannot rule
 out that other factors correlated with the identified effect
 modifiers may have played a role.
 Numerous studies have demonstrated that non-­ live
 vaccines after MV have a negative effect particularly for
 girls. 14 17 29 31 We speculate that this might explain the
 observed pattern after MenAfriVac. We have argued else-
 where that providing a live vaccine after non-­live vaccines
 reverses a potential detrimental effect of the non-­live
 vaccine. 17 However, the present data suggest that MV
 after Penta3 may not always be sufficient. Despite no
 measurable overall benefit on health, it was clear that the
 MV-­for-­all-­policy had a marked effect on MV coverage.
 
<section> CONCLUSION
 The MV-­for-­all-­policy facilitated vaccination opportunities
 for children who would otherwise be unlikely to receive
 measles vaccination. We found no overall effect on child 
<section> health but detected differential mortality patterns indi-
 cating that both prior and subsequent vaccine exposures
 
<section> affect the response to MV.
