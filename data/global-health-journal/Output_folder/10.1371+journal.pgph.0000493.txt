<section> Abstract
 
<section> About 85% of Zimbabwe’s >1.4 million people living with HIV are on antiretroviral treatment
 (ART). Further expansion of its treatment program will require more efficient use of existing
 resources. Two promising strategies for reducing resource utilization per patient are multi-
 month medication dispensing and community-based service delivery. We evaluated the costs
 to providers and patients of community-based, multi-month ART delivery models in Zimbabwe.
 We used resource and outcome data from a cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial of three
 ferentiated service delivery (DSD) models targeted to patients stable on ART: 3-month facility-
 based care (3MF), community ART refill groups (CAGs) with 3-month dispensing (3MC), and
 CAGs with 6-month dispensing (6MC). Using local unit costs, we estimated the annual cost
 2020 USD of providing HIV treatment per patient from the provider and patient perspectives.
 the trial, retention at 12 months was 93.0% in the 3MF, 94.8% in the 3MC, and 95.5% in the
 6MC arms. The total average annual cost of HIV treatment per patient was $187 (standard
 deviation $39), $178 ($30), and $167 ($39) in each of the three arms, respectively. The annual
 cost/patient was dominated by ART medications (79% in 3MF, 87% in 3MC; 92% in 6MC), fol-
 lowed by facility visits (12%, 5%, 5%, respectively) and viral load (8%, 8%, 2%, respectively).
 When costs were stratified by district, DSD models cost slightly less, with 6MC the least expen-
 sive in all districts. Savings were driven by differences in the number of facility visits made/
 year, as expected, and low uptake of annual viral load tests in the 6-month arm. The total
 annual cost to patients to obtain HIV care was $10.03 ($2) in the 3MF arm, $5.12 ($0.41) in the
 3MC arm, and $4.40 ($0.39) in the 6MF arm. For stable ART patients in Zimbabwe, 3- and 6-
 month community-based multi-month dispensing models cost less for both providers and
 patients than 3-month facility-based care and had non-inferior outcomes.

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Zimbabwe, a country in southern Africa of just under 15 million people, has a high burden of
 HIV infection, with a prevalence of more than 10% among adults [1, 2]. Great progress has
 been made in expanding access to testing and treatment, care, with an estimated 78% of all
 people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) [2]. Achieving the UNAIDS
 95-95-95 targets, however, will require both further expansion of the treatment program and
 more efficient use of existing resources, as global donor support for HIV programs has pla-
 teaued [3, 4].
 One promising strategy for expanding access to HIV treatment, improving outcomes, and
 increasing efficiency is the implementation and scale-up of differentiated service delivery
 (DSD) models. DSD models aim to move away from a “one-size-fits-all” approach to HIV ser-
 vice delivery and tailor care delivery to patient needs [5]. DSD models typically adjust the loca-
 tion and frequency of service delivery, as well as the cadres of healthcare staff involved and
 specific services provided [6]. Examples include, but are not limited to, community adherence
 groups (CAGs), community-based medication pickup points, and multi-month dispensing
 (MMD) of medications.
 In addition to reducing the burden of care on patients and achieving (at least) non-inferior
 clinical outcomes DSD models are expected to reduce costs for both patients and providers
 [7–9]. A small number of recent studies from southern Africa suggest that some but not all
 DSD models allow for modest provider cost savings; some models have been found to increase
 provider costs–mostly due to a higher number of interactions required in the models of care
 than observed in standard of care [10]. Nearly all DSD models studied have substantially
 reduced costs to patients, but by varying amounts [7, 11]. To our knowledge, no estimates of
 actual costs of DSD models in Zimbabwe have been published. Using data from a cluster ran-
 domized trial, we evaluated the costs to providers and patients of community-based, multi-
 month ART delivery models in Zimbabwe.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study setting and interventions
 
<section> We used resource and outcome data from a cluster randomized, non-inferiority trial of DSD
 models for patients in Zimbabwe who met criteria as being stable on ART (S1 Table). The trial
 has previously been described in detail [12]. ART is provided free of charge to eligible resi-
 dents. Patients were considered stable if they had an undetectable viral load and had remained
 on the same treatment regimen for at least 6 months. A total of 30 healthcare facilities (clus-
 ters) were randomized to offer one of three DSD models: three-month dispensing at the facility
 (3MF); three-month dispensing through a community ART refill group (3MC); or six-month
 dispensing through a community ART refill group (6MC). 3MF was an enhanced version of
 the standard of care at the time of the study in which patients visited a health facility every
 months and received both a clinical consultation and a 3-month supply of ART at every visit.
 The 3MF arm was thus more resource intensive than actual standard of care, which required
 at least annual consultations only. The 3MC and 6MC arms utilized community ART refill
 groups (CAGs) of 6–12 patients each. A rotating patient representative of the CAG visited the
 facility and collected medications for all patients in the group every 3 or 6 months and then
 distributed medications to other group members at quarterly community meetings. All
 patients enrolled in CAGs were required to make a routine clinic visit for a consultation every
 12 months. Ethical permission for the study was granted by the Medical Research Council of 
<section> Zimbabwe, together with approvals provided by the Research Council of Zimbabwe and the
 Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary study outcome was retention in care at 12 months, defined as 1-attrition. Attri-
 tion included loss to follow-up and all-cause mortality; loss to follow-up was defined as not
 collecting ART for �90 days during the follow-up period [12]. For this economic analysis, we
 calculated: 1) the annual cost to the provider (healthcare system) per patient treated and per
 patient retained; and 2) the annual cost to access care from the patient perspective.
 
<section> Provider cost data collection and analysis
 
<section> For the analysis from the provider perspective, we followed the same methodology as reported
 in a sister study conducted in Lesotho [11]. We collected resource utilisation (visits, ART dis-
 pensed and laboratory tests performed) from patient records over the study period. Our data
 collection tool did not allow us to discern between scheduled facility and scheduled CAG visits.
 To calculate the number of visits by type, we assumed that all scheduled visits in the conven-
 tional care arm (3MF) were facility based. For the CAG arms, we assumed that two and one
 the visits were facility visits for 3MC and 6MC, respectively.
 
<section> Unit cost estimates
 
<section> Costs are reported in 2020 USD (S2 Table). Provider costs included the ART provided, labora-
 tory costs, facility costs and the cost of delivering a CAG interaction [13]. The cost of visits
 were calculated as the average cost of delivering a facility visit and CAG interaction as found
 microcosting studies in two other countries [10, 11]. Equipment costs were annualized at a dis-
 count rate of 5% over their useful life years.
 
<section> Patient cost data collection and analysis
 
<section> For the costs incurred by patients, we considered the transport costs to and from facility and
 CAG interactions, wages lost due to time seeking care and the total time patients spent access-
 ing care. Data on patient costs were collected from a subset of 1,082 participants in all 3 study
 arms through semi-structured interviews with an 11-item questionnaire at study enrolment
 and the end of the 12-month follow-up period. Patients were asked about the number of visits
 to DSD interactions, the time spent on travel to access care, travel cost and distance travelled.
 We then used these data to estimate the average amount transport costs incurred for a patient
 to access a facility visit or a CAG meeting. These costs were then multiplied, at the patient
 level, by the respective number of facility visits and CAG meetings an individual attended.
 We assigned a value of lost wages to the opportunity costs of accessing care either at a facil-
 ity or a CAG visit. To do this, we assumed an average daily wage of daily GDP per capita,
 which amounted to $1.50 per day, because Zimbabwe does not have a stated minimum wage
 [14]. We assigned a full day’s wages lost for each facility visit and a quarter of a day’s wages lost
 for each CAG meeting. This assumption was based on interviews with DSD implementors and
 includes travel and waiting time for each DSD interaction [11].
 
<section> Sensitivity analysis
 
<section> To account for diffences in viral load availability at the time of the study, we calculated the
 total provider cost if all participants who met the primary outcome (retained in care) were to
 receive a viral load. In this analysis we therefore included the cost of one viral load and 
<section> associated clinic visit for all patients who were retained in care but for whom no viral load was
 recorded in the resource utilization dataset.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> The trial enrolled 4,800 participants (1,919 in 3MF, 1,335 in 3MC, and 1,546 in 6MC) (S1
 Table). A detailed description of participants is provided elsewhere [12]. Of relevance to this
 economic evaluation, most participants attended facilities in rural settings (80% in the 3MF
 arm, 71% in the 3MC arm, and 78% in the 6MC arm). Employment differed significantly
 between arms; 52% of 6MC, 40% of 3MF, and 24% of 3MC patients were employed. Most par-
 ticipants in all arms lived within 9 km of the nearest healthcare facility, but a significant minor-
 ity (27% in 3MF, 18% in both 3MC and 6MC) lived 9 km or more from the nearest facility.
 The trial demonstrated non-inferiority of outcomes in the two community CAG arms,
 compared to the facility-based arm. Retention in care at 12 months was highest in the 6MC
 arm (95.5%), followed by 3MC (94.8%) and 3MF (93.0%).
 
<section> Resource utilization and unit costs
 
<section> Table 1 (panel a) presents average resource utilization per patient by study arm. The numbers
 of interactions with the healthcare system per patient per year were roughly consistent with
 model design: 5.01 visits per year in 3MF, 5.02 in 3MC, and 3.13 in 6MC. All five 3MF interac-
 tions were visits to the healthcare facility, while only two were facility visits in the 3 and
 6-monthly CAG arms. CAG interactions (group meetings) in the two community-based arms
 differed, with a mean of 3.05/patient/year in 3MC and 1.18/patient/year in 6MC.
 Months of ART dispensed did not differ significantly among any of the arms, with partici-
 pants receiving 11.39 months in 3MF, 11.51 in 3MC, and 11.28 in 6MC. The number of viral
 load tests conducted—intended to average 1 per year—was very low in 6MC, with only 0.08
 tests done per patient over the 12-month study period. This number rose to 0.49 and 0.45 in
 the 3MC and 3MF arms, respectively.
 We estimated the all-inclusive cost of a facility visit as $4.62 and of a CAG interaction as
 $1.88. From existing literature, we assumed a cost of $14.42 per viral load test and $13.81 for
 month of first-line ART [15].
 
<section> Provider costs per patient
 
<section> As shown in Table 1 (panel b), the mean annual cost to the provider per patient enrolled in the
 study was highest in the 3MF arm at $187.04 (95% CI $185.31-$188.78), followed by 3MC at
 $177.83 ($181.80–183.83) and 6MC at $167.40 (CI $165.44-$169.36). The same pattern held
 for those retained in care, with the 3MF arm costing $195.06 (95% CI $194.11-$195.99) per
 patient retained compared to $182.81 ($181.80-$183.83) in the 3MC arm and $172.81
 ($171.30-$174.31) in the 6MC arm. Differences in costs (Table 1 panel c) between the facility-
 based arm (3MF) and the two community-based arms were driven by differences in visit costs
 —$23.98/patient/year in the 3MF arm compared to $9.23 and $9.22 in the 3MC and 6MC
 arms respectively. The difference in cost between the 3MF and 6 MF models reflects both the
 smaller number of CAG meetings in the 6MC model and, importantly, the small proportion
 patients in 6MC who completed viral load tests during the year-long follow up period. This
 further explored in the district-level analysis.
 When stratified by setting (Table 2), we found that participants in urban settings inccurred
 higher costs than those in rural settings (3MF: $196.35 vs $184.69, 3MC: $189.39 vs $173.11
 6MC: $171.00 vs $166.40) across all arms. Cost savings were more pronounced in the urban

<section> setting between the 6MC and 3MF arm, while larger reductions in costs were observed among
 rural participants when comparing the 3MC arm to 3MF.
 
<section> Costs to patients
 
<section> The average annual cost to patients to receive ART care was $10.03 (95% CI $9.94-$10.12) in
 the 3MF arm, $5.12 ($5.09-$5.14) in the 3MC arm and $4.40 ($4.37–4.42) in the 6MC arm
 (Table 1, panel d). Patient costs were driven by wages lost in attending facility visits, as each
 visit was associated with losing an entire day’s wages, while CAG meetings only resulted in a
 quarter of a day’s wages lost. Travel time followed a similar pattern: participants in the 3MF
 arm averaged 13.35 hours (95% CI 13.23–13.47) of travel time for healthcare interactions per
 year, while those in the 3MC and 6MC arms averaged only 6.32 (6.30–6.35) and 5.66 (5.64–
 
<section> 5.68) hours, respectively.
 
<section> Variability among districts
 
<section> To understand variability in provider costs by location, we also estimated average provider
 cost/patient retained in care by geographic district. Costs varied among districts by roughly
 10% in the 3MC arm, 7% in the 3MF arm; and 3% in the 6MC arm (Table 3). Variability
 among districts was driven mainly by differences in viral load test utilization. The proportion

 of patients receiving a viral load test varied widely by geographic district, as well as by study
 arm, from a low of just 4% of patients in Beitridge District, which is primarily rural, in the
 6MC arm to a high of 96% of patients in Chintingwiza District, which is primarily urban, in
 both study arms implemented there [12]. Differences in viral load utilization stemmed in part
 from differential access to testing equipment—viral load testing capacity was being rolled out
 in Zimbabwe at the time of the study and had not yet reached all the study districts. Even in
 districts that appear to have had viral load testing capacity, however, such as Beitbridge,
 patients in community models were generally less likely to have tests than were patients in the
 facility-based model.
 
<section> Sensitivity analysis
 
<section> When assuming that all individuals retained in care receive a viral load (Table 4), the total
 average cost to the provider increased across all arms (from $195.06 to $204.98 in 3MF;
 $182.81 to $193.36 in 3MC; $172.81 to $190.42 in 6MC). The 3MF arm remained the most
 costly at $204.98 (95% CI $204.13-$205.83) compared to $193.36 ($192.49-$194.24) and
 $190.42 ($188.94-$191.90) in the 3MC and 6MC arm, respectively. Differences between arms
 were smaller, with the 3MC decreasing from 6.3% in the primary analysis to a difference of
 5.7% when assuming full viral load access. The difference between the costs in the 3MF and
 6MC arms decreased from 11.4% in the primary analysis to 7.1% when assuming full viral load
 access.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> In this economic evaluation of three differentiated models of ART delivery in Zimbabwe, we
 found that both 3- and 6-monthly dispensing through community ART groups reduced costs
 for both providers and patients, primarily by reducing the number of visits required to a
 healthcare facility. For patients who meet eligibility criteria—those who are regarded as “sta-
 ble” on ART—the two community models also achieved non-inferior retention in care, as pre-
 viously reported [12]. They can thus both be regarded as cost-effective alternatives to facility-
 based care with 3 month dispensing.
 In interpreting this finding of cost-effectiveness, a number of provisos should be kept in
 mind. First, cost savings per patient in the community models were relatively modest (5–
 10% less than the facility model), and, importantly, these savings will only be realized if
 resource allocation at facilities is also adjusted. Fewer patient visits to a clinic, for example,
 will only reduce healthcare budgets if the change allows the facility to pay for fewer human
 and physical resources. In most cases, clinics do not have the ability to match their physical
 space, staff complement, or other resources to relatively modest changes in demand for 
<section> services, at least in the short term. Instead, the “savings” from enrolling patients in less
 intensive models of care—here defined to mean those requiring fewer clinic visits—are
 likely to be seen in shorter waiting times for patients, higher quality of care from clinicians,
 more time available for activities including record-keeping and outreach, and/or more time
 for staff breaks or shorter working hours. These changes (with the possible exception of the
 last one) may be of great value to the health system and its patients, but they will not result
 in monetary savings.
 A second consideration is that one reason for the lower cost of the 6MC model, in particu-
 lar, was the poor uptake of viral load testing in this arm. We believe the reasons to be a combi-
 nation of geographic access—some districts did not yet have viral load testing capacity, and
 6MC was overrepresented in these districts—and the small number of clinic visits made by
 6MC patients. While we cannot be certain of the latter reason, the fact that two districts, Mber-
 engwa and Beitridge, tested far more 3MF patients than 3MC or 6MC patients may indicate
 need for more investment in compliance with annual viral load testing guidelines if patients
 receive services in the community, rather than at a facility. A sensitivity analysis in which we
 assumed that all patients who were retained in care received a viral load still showed cost-sav-
 ings in the CAG arms, albeit more modest.
 And third, while the trial and this analysis used the 3MF arm to represent standard of care
 in Zimbabwe, the 3MF model in fact provided more care than currently is recommended by
 national guidelines in Zimbabwe, which require only one clinical consultation a year. We thus
 cannot be sure that true standard of care costs as much as the 3MF model analyzed here,
 though our study design accounts for WHO guidelines that recommend clinical visits 3-
 6monthly for patients stable on ART [16].
 Our findings that DSD models are potentially cost saving to both the provider and patient
 while achieving similar results in retaining patients in care add to a small but growing evidence
 base that at least some DSD models cost less than conventional, facility-based care. A parallel
 study conducted in Lesotho reported a similar saving (6%) to providers and substantial savings
 to patients [11], and a trial of facility-based MMD in Malawi and Zambia found that increasing
 the dispensing interval can lead to small cost savings even if all interactions occur at a health
 facility [7, 17]. A study of a variety of DSD models in Zambia, however, found that the models
 considered were slightly more expensive than conventional care, probably because the models
 did not reduce the resources required per patient treated. In all studies that have measured
 them, savings to patients in time and money tend to be large, an important consideration even
 if providers’ budgets are not affected [7, 18].
 In addition to the considerations above, our study had two other limitations. First, the total
 number of interactions per participant was captured in the study, but not the type of visit. The
 breakdown of visits was therefore based on the model as recommended. Second, we did not
 collect patient cost data on all patients and therefore had to assign costs on a per-visit basis by
 visit type, based on average costs reported by the subset of participants who completed the
 patient cost questionnaire.
 Despite these limitations, this study demonstrates that in Zimbabwe, community ART
 groups can save money for both providers and patients, particularly when combined with
 6-month dispensing, without compromising patient outcomes. The consistency of this finding
 with those of other studies suggests that for stable, adult ART patients, offering community-
 based models of care makes sense for the healthcare system. The next challenge will be to iden-
 tify cost-effective models of care for patients who do not meet current criteria for stability,
 such as a suppressed viral load or experience on ART, and for children, adolescents, and other
 groups.
