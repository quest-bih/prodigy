<section> Abstract
 
<section> Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of progressive neurological disability. The
 prevalence of MS is much more common in women than men. The women are exposed to a variety of symptoms
 including fatigue. Acupressure is a noninvasive procedure that can be used to control symptoms including
 fatigue. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of acupressure on fatigue in women with multiple
 sclerosis.
 
<section> Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted on 100 women with MS at Tehran MS Association. The
 subjects were equally allocated to experimental group and a placebo group (50 women per group) by blocking
 randomization method. The experimental group were received acupressure, at the true points (ST36, SP6, LI4)
 and the placebo group, were received touching at the same points. Fatigue was measured by a Fatigue Severity
 Scale (FSS) in the groups at immediately prior to, two and four weeks after the beginning of the intervention.
 The data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics by SPSS version
 
<section> Results: The findings indicated no differences in demographic characteristics and the severity of fatigue at the
 baseline in two groups (p=0.54). But there were significant reductions of the mean score of fatigue in the
 experimental group compared to the placebo group immediately, two and four weeks after the intervention
 respectively (p=0.03, p≤0/001, p=0.04).
 
<section> Conclusion: According to the findings, the study provided an alternative method for health care providers
 including nurses to train acupressure to the clients with MS to managing their fatigue.

<section> 1. Introduction
 
<section> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent neurological disease (Mao & Reddy, 2010). It is characterized by
 lesions and scarring of the protective myelin sheath of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to neuronal
 damage and axonal loss (Burgess, 2002; Calasanti & King, 2007). It is more common in women than in men
 (Schwendimann & Alekseeva, 2007). According to a study in Tehran, the prevalence of MS in Tehran has been
 estimated to be 51.9 per 100,000 people in 2010 (Sahraian et al., 2010). Multiple Sclerosis is unpredictable and
 is one of the major diseases affecting patients’ quality of life (Janardhan & Bakshi, 2002). The course of the
 disease is uncertain and the clients with MS may face physical problems including muscle weakness, bladder and
 bowel dysfunction, problems with speech, and vision (Schapiro, 2007) and also hidden difficulties such as
 fatigue (Burgess, 2002; Calasanti & King, 2007). The patient’s fatigue might be extremely debilitating and often
 causes one to have a sedentary lifestyle i.e. sitting, lying down or sleeping. Moreover, it has a great influence on
 all aspects of life, particularly on occupation, daily life activities, social relationships and self-care activities
 (Samuels & Ropper, 2010).
 
<section> Currently, many pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic methods are used to relieve fatigue. However,
 pharmacologic approaches such as Amantadine to control fatigue in women with MS may have side-effects
 including insomnia, increased constipation and increased urinary retention for them (Induruwa, Constantinescu, 
<insert> Figure 1. Consort flow diagram indicating patient screening, intervention allocation, and analysis
 * n= number of patients 
<iend>

 
<section> & Gran, 2012). Therefore, it seems that using non-pharmacological methods is necessary in order to reduce the
 side effects. During recent years, the attention of many patients including MS patients has been drawn to
 non-pharmacological methods which are known by the name of complementary alternative therapies (CAT)
 (Kochs, Wegener, Sühnel, Voigt, & Zettl, 2014). Acupressure as a CAT has been reported to be useful in
 symptom management in a variety of patient populations (Chen & Chen, 2004). It is a non-invasive,
 cost-effective technique, with no side-effects (Cho & Hwang, 2010). The advantage of this method is that it is
 easy to use and learn, and therefore it can be applied by the patients, themselves (Esmonde & Long, 2008). It is
 noteworthy that there have been no cases of incompatibility between acupressure and other therapeutic methods;
 therefore, acupressure can be used simultaneously with other methods. The principles of acupressure are similar
 to acupuncture except that no needle is used, and the acu-points are stimulated using fingers or special tools
 (Polit & Beck, 2003). In the light of the limited research on fatigue reduction interventions in women with MS
 the present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of nurse-provided acupressure on fatigue in women
 with MS.
 
<section> 2. Method
 
<section> This study was a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with a prospective pre-post experimental design. This RCT was
 conducted on 100 women with MS at "Tehran Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Association". The subjects as the member
 of the MS Association were selected with continuous sampling method. The subjects were equally allocated to
 the experimental group and the placebo group (50 women per group) by blocking randomization method. The
 sample size was estimated according to the power analysis and considering a normal distribution for the main
 primary outcome measures. In the study, the power, effect size, and alpha were set as 0.80, 0.20, and 0.05,
 respectively (Yeung et al., 2012), based on the results of a previous study (Sobhani, 2012). The flow of patients
 through the trial is presented in Figure 1.

<section> Approval for the study was given by the Ethics Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in
 accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1995 Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent
 was obtained from the participants prior to their inclusion in the study. The participating women were also given
 verbal information before taking their informed consent. The inclusion criteria were: (a) age at least 18 years, (b)
 stable vital signs, (c) no scar, lesion, scratch or deformities on the skin of selected areas (d) being literate, (e)
 complaining of fatigue (assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS] with the score of 5 and over, (f) no history
 of smoking, substance or sedatives use and (g) not pregnant. The exclusion criteria were lack of the subjects’
 willingness to continue participation in the trial for any reason, such as complications, or known serious physical
 or mental diseases during the trial. Also, the women who had not feeling of warmth, heaviness, or numbness
 during applying acupressure on the points LI4, ST36, and SP6 for any reason were excluded from the study. The
 primary outcome as the fatigue severity was measured immediately prior the intervention and immediately, two

 and four weeks after the intervention, to evaluate the effect of nurse-provided acupressure on fatigue in women
 with MS between August 2011 and October 2011.
 
<section> The experimental group were received acupressure, at the acupoints (ST36, SP6, LI4) and the placebo group,
 were received touching at the same points in the first session. The duration of each session of the intervention
 was 3 minutes bilaterally, for each group. In other words, the acupressure intervention, i.e. pressure on the
 acupoints, was conducted for three minutes (several cycles including 10 seconds consecutive pressure and 2
 seconds rest) on each of the mentioned points, and then this was repeated for the opposite side of the body. This
 procedure took 18 minutes for each intervention per day. During training session the researcher demonstrated the
 procedure in one part of the patient’s body, and asked her to do the same herself on the other side of the body.
 The training was over when the correct practice by the patients was ensured. It was explained to the patients that
 the accuracy of the points or channels are confirmed by the client feeling warmth, heaviness, or numbness in that
 special areas. These procedures were also performed in the placebo group but by touching rather than pressing
 the required three points that were similar to the experimental group. Also the placebo group was not given the
 pamphlet.
 
<section> After the completion of the intervention on both sides of the body at the first session, the women completed FSS
 again, and it was considered as the immediate post- test intervention. Then the groups were trained and taught to
 perform the same procedure for themselves (as Self-administered acupressure) at the same points twice daily for
 two weeks, at home. The researcher who had a certificate of applying acupressure and she was taught under the
 supervision of an acupuncturist and acupressure specialist, was responsible for the education. The first individual
 training session was implemented in a conference room at the MS Association for each subject by the researcher
 for 35 minutes with a face-to-face education.
 
<section> The oral educational session was supplemented with pamphlets, demonstrating the technique of pressing the true
 acu-points with accurate duration, showing posters and slides by PowerPoint Software for the experimental
 group after providing full explanation about the research objective. The same researcher educated the placebo
 group about the procedure of touching at the same acu-points (except providing pamphlet). One of the required
 acupoints was L.I.4 or Hegu channel which is the major painless relaxant point. It is located on the dorsum of the
 hand, between the 1st and 2nd metacarpal bones, in the middle of the 2nd metacarpal bone on the radial side,
 when the thumb is fully extended, i.e. the bones of the thumb and the first finger. The other is the ST36 point or
 Zusanli which is to the lateral side of the middle toe, 3 individual cun below the genu, i.e. on the anterior lateral
 side of the leg, one finger breadth (middle finger) from the anterior crest of the tibia, which is one of the most
 effective locations for reduction of fatigue and a general balance point. The last point is SP6 or Sanyinjiao,
 which is on the medial side of the leg, 3 cun above the tip of the medial malleolus, posterior to the medial border
 of the tibia, is one of the major and most commonly used channels (Molassiotis, Sylt, & Diggins, 2007) which is
 shown in Figure 2.
 
<section> Fatigue as a primary outcome, was measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) in the groups at immediately
 prior to, and immediately two and four weeks after the beginning of the intervention. The fatigue severity scale
 (FSS) measures the patient’s ability to function with nine statements each of which are scored from 1-7 in Likert
 scale, by classifying them as 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree). The final score is calculated by
 averaging the sum of responses divided by nine. Therefore, the mean score was used to compare the severity of
 fatigue in the two groups. The scale is one of the highly reliable tools to investigate fatigue, and to only evaluate
 the concept of fatigue. This tool evaluates fatigue in MS patients more quickly compared with other tools; that is

 to say that the obtained score is fully compatible with the rate and severity of fatigue. The reliability of FSS has
 been measured through Cronbach’s alpha with coefficient 0.77 for patients with MS (Learmonth et al., 2013).
 In order the patients do not forget applying the intervention twice daily for two weeks; they were given a
 reminder timetable to mark the schedule each time after implementing the intervention (in the morning and
 afternoon). Thereafter, during the two weeks intervention, the researcher followed-up their procedures through
 phone calls every day. In addition, the patients were given two copies of the questionnaire of FSS to complete
 them; one after the end of the intervention at the end of the second week (14th day), and the other, at the end of
 the forth week (28th day). Totally, FSS was completed four times including pre-first intervention and
 immediately after the first intervention (with the presence of the researcher) and at the end of day 14 and day
 Besides, in order to avoid any possible and potential bias, implementation of the intervention was done only by
 one researcher. Finally, at the end of the trial and the post- phases, the data were analyzed through SPSS for
 Windows version 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and applying chi square, Fisher’s exact-test, independent
 t-test and repeated measure ANOVA; hence, the two groups were compared to each other.
 
<section> 3. Results
 
<section> The study results showed that there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age,
 duration and recurrence of the disease (Table 1).
 
<section> The groups were similar in terms of other demographic variables including education, marital status, occupation
 and medication (amantadine) with regard to fatigue. Statistically, there was no significant difference between
 fatigue severity in the experimental and placebo groups before the intervention. But, based on the independent
 t-test, there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of fatigue severity immediately, two,
 and four weeks after the intervention (Table 2).
 
<section> Fatigue severity was lower in the experimental group compared to the placebo group. In addition, repeated
 measures ANOVA (with the Bonferroni method for pairwise comparison) were used to compare the mean scores
 of fatigue severity during the four phases, i.e. before, immediately, two weeks and four weeks after the
 intervention which the differences were statistically significant for the three phases at post-test compared to the
 pre-intervention phase (P ≤ 0.001). However, such a trend was not evident in the placebo group in the study.
 Also, no complication occurred during the acupressure.
 
<section> 4. Discussion
 
<section> The present study generally aimed to evaluate the impact of acupressure on the severity of fatigue in women
 with MS. In this study, there were no significant differences regarding demographic variables and also severity 
<section> of fatigue in two groups at pre-intervention (p≤0.05). But at post- test, the results showed significant
 improvement of the mean scores of fatigue in the experimental group compared to the placebo group at
 immediately, two, and four weeks after the intervention. The result was consistent with the finding of a
 systematic review study, indicated that use of acupressure significantly effect on improving symptoms including
 fatigue in the acupressure group (Lee & Frazier, 2011). This study focused on fatigue which is mostly
 underdiagnosed and poor management that contributes to increased symptom burden and poorer quality of life in
 patients (McKeown, Porter-Armstrong, & Baxter, 2003) As there are scares studies concerning the impact of
 acupuncture or acupressure on fatigue of patients, it should be emphasized that the symptom of fatigue has also
 an adverse effect on quality of life and life satisfaction of the patients with MS (Y. H. Kim, H. J. Kim, Ahn, Seo,
 & S. H. Kim, 2013) therefore; non-pharmacological methods to improve patients' fatigue could be an important
 approach regarding holistic nursing care. Zick et al. believe that acupressure as a branch of acupuncture could be
 a useful therapy for improving fatigue as well as sleep quality and quantity in patients with chronic diseases
 (Zick et al., 2010). Since acupressure is a method of complementary therapy, the results are congruent with the
 result of a systematic review study that revealed that exercise training as a complementary therapy is effective
 for improving fatigue, and health-related quality of life in patients with chronic diseases (Latimer-Cheung et al.,
 2013).
 
<section> Though differences in intervention type and in acupressure treatments, study population, length of study and
 duration/frequency of acupressure intervention, acupoint locations, fatigue scales, and use of acupuncture rather
 than acupressure should all be considered in comparisons of the findings. Moreover, no participant stopped their
 acupressure or withdrew from the study as a result of these effects. Because the relative homogeneity of our
 study sample of women predominantly literate and in their reproductive age, may be a main reason that our
 participants responded more favorably to acupressure training than observed in other studies. This study is
 unique as the findings revealed that acupressure at the point (ST36, SP6, and LI4) can reduce the fatigue of the
 women with MS, in the acupressure group compared to the placebo. Acupressure techniques can be easily taught
 to patients so that they can manage relaxation themselves (Guerreiro da Silva, Nakamura, Cordeiro, & Kulay,
 2005). In an attempt to offer comfort and improvement of fatigue to patients, nursing is becoming increasingly
 involved in offering complementary-alternative therapies as part of caring-healing process in comprehensive
 patient care (Maa et al., 2007). Acupressure is one such modality that is being increasingly used by both medical
 and nursing professionals.
 
<section> There are some limitations that should also be noted. This study focused on a self-report questionnaire for
 assessing subjective aspect of fatigue and also not investigating the effect of acupressure for a longer period
 more than four weeks. Therefore, it may be possible that evaluation of fatigue with more prolonged period
 acupressure might lead in more conclusive results. Further research is also necessary to test the benefits of
 acupressure with different duration and gender on symptom management including fatigue with a larger sample.
 Therefore, the results, may have limited generalizability to other population such as male patients with MS or
 even other general population. On the other hand, we should also mention that consecutive follow-ups after the
 first session of the acupressure training and phone call follow-ups, as a reminder timetable to the groups, could
 be the strengths of this study in terms of confirming the regular performance of self-administered acupressure in
 the participants and not losing the subjects. Therefore, further research to assess the utilization of acupressure for
 reducing fatigue and promote the comfort of the patients (males and females) with MS is strongly recommended.
 In conclusion, follow-up tests indicated there were significant differences of the mean scores of fatigue between
 the acupressure group and the placebo group (p<0.001). Acupressure is a non-pharmacological, cost-effective
 and simple technique, which is applicable anywhere and anytime. Therefore, the study provided an alternative
 method for health care providers including nurses to train acupressure to the clients with MS to managing their
 fatigue.
