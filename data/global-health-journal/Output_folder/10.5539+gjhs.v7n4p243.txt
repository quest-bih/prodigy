<section> Abstract
 
<section> Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D intake on COPD exacerbation and FEV1 in the
 patients with severe and very severe COPD.
 
<section> Methods: This double blind placebo control randomized clinical trial study was done in the Ashayer university
 hospital in Khorramabad in 2012. Eighty eight patients with severe and very severe COPD were randomly
 selected from those who recoursed to the internal medicine clinic of Ashayer hospital. They were randomly
 allocated to case and placebo group. The patients received routine treatment for COPD. Along with the routine
 treatment, placebo group received 100,000 IU of oral vitamin D per month, for 6 months. Data was analyzed
 using SPSS computer software, paired t-test, independent t-test, non parametric t-test and Pearson correlation
 coefficients.
 
<section> Results: In each group, there were 44 patients. After the intervention, there were significant differences in FEV1
 and the number of COPD exacerbation between the case and control group patients. Also, after the study, in the
 case group, FEV1 was increased and the number of COPD exacerbation was decreased significantly.
 
<section> Conclusion: Vitamin D intake decreased COPD exacerbation and improved FEV1 in the patients with severe
 and very severe COPD. It is suggested that baseline serum vitamin D levels will recorded in similar studies and
 the effect of vitamin D intake will evaluated regarding the baseline serum vitamin D levels.

<section> 1. Introduction
 
<section> Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic disease that causes persistent airflow obstruction.
 The airflow obstruction in this disease is generally progressive (MacNee et al., 2005). COPD has two clinical
 phases (stable phase and exacerbation phase), both of which are associated with inflammation (Barbu et al.,
 2011). Smoking, passive smoking, reactivity of airways, occupational factors and air pollution are the risk
 factors of COPD (Reilly et al., 2004). Independent risk factors for COPD are male gender, advanced age, low
 socioeconomic status, occupational exposure and cigarette smoking (Caballero et al., 2008).
 Based on the World Health Organization estimation, COPD will be the third cause of mortality in the world in
 2020 (Murray et al., 1997). Ninety percent of COPD deaths occur in low and middle income countries (Murray
 et al., 1997). In European countries, depending on the age of participants, the methods used and the location, the
 prevalence of COPD ranged from 2.1% to 26.1% (Atsou et al., 2011). It was 8.9% in India (from 6.2% to 13.5%;
 based on spirometry) (Afonso et al., 2011), 3.02% in the Netherlands (in a population-based study including
 subjects ≥ 40) (8), 17.4% in Copenhagen (aged 35 years or older) (Fabricius et al., 2011) and 3.7% in Abu Dhabi
 (in 40-80 year old subjects) (Al Zaabi et al., 2011).
 
<section> Nowadays, the attention to nonskeletal effects of vitamin D has been increased (Kunisaki et al., 2011). An
 association between pulmonary function and serum vitamin D levels has been reported in some studies. It has
 been reported that vitamin D deficiency correlates with severity of COPD (Janssens et al., 2010). Also, in some
 studies, it has been declared that COPD patients had a raised risk for vitamin D deficiency (Persson et al., 2012,
 Zhang et al., 2012). Likewise, in one study, it has been stated that total vitamin D intake was negatively
 associated with COPD (Shaheen et al., 2011).

 According to previous studies, the effect of levels vitamin D is controversial on COPD exacerbation and
 FEV1.This study aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D intake on COPD exacerbation and FEV1 in the
 patients with severe and very severe COPD.
 
<section> 2. Method
 
<section> This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was done in Ashayer university hospital in
 Khorramabad in 2012. The Ethics and Research Committee of Lorestan University of Medical Sciences
 approved this study. Furthermore, we obtained signed informed consents from all the participants. This study has
 been recorded in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials at www.irct.ir as a clinical trial (IRCT2012071810332N1).
 Eighty-eight patients with severe and very severe COPD were randomly selected from those who recoursed to
 the internal medicine clinic of Ashayer hospital. Severe and very severe COPD were defined as Global Initiative
 for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines (Donaldson et al., 2002). The selected patients were
 allocated to the study and placebo groups by simple random sampling method. The patients in both the groups
 received the routine treatment for COPD. Along with the routine treatment, the study group received 100,000 IU
 of oral vitamin D per month, for 6 months. In contrast, the placebo group received oral placebo for 6 months.
 Before the study, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was determined, and the number of COPD
 exacerbations during the last 6 months was recorded in the both groups. After 6 months of treatment, FEV1 was
 determined, and the number of COPD exacerbations during the study span was evaluated in the both groups. The
 patients received a telephone call every 2 months to assess respiratory symptoms consistent with a COPD
 exacerbation. The definition of COPD exacerbation was either the presence of 2 or more of these major
 symptoms (increase in sputum purulence, sputum volume or dyspnea) or any of major symptoms accompanied
 by any of minor symptoms (increase in nasal discharge, wheeze, sore throat, cough or fever) for at least two
 consecutive days (Donaldson et al., 2002).
 
<section> 2.1 Statistics
 
<section> The data was analyzed using the SPSS computer software and paired t-test, independent t-test, non-parametric
 t-test and Pearson correlation coefficients. The P-values<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
 
<section> 3. Results
 
<section> In each group, there were 44 patients, 30 of whom (68.2%) were male. There were no significant differences
 between age distribution, cigarette smoking and addiction in the study and placebo groups (Table 1).
 The mean of FEV1 and COPD exacerbations according to sex, age distribution, cigarette smoking and addiction,
 before and after the study, are shown in Table 2 and Table 3.

 the study and placebo group patients. But, after the study, there were significant differences in FEV1 and the
 number of COPD exacerbations between the study and placebo group patients. Also, after the study, in the study
 group, FEV1 was increased and the number of COPD exacerbations was decreased significantly (Table 4).
 
<section> 4. Discussion
 
<section> COPD is a chronic and common disease. COPD can cause severe complications. Afonso et al., reported that 26%
 and 2.8% of the patients with very severe COPD and non-COPD patients had died after 1 year of follow-up in
 the Netherlands (Afonso et al., 2011).
 
<section> An association between pulmonary function and serum vitamin D levels has been reported in some studies. It has
 been reported that vitamin D deficiency correlates with the severity of COPD (Janssens et al., 2010). Also, it has
 been reported that a significant relation between FEV1 and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels (Azargoon et al.,
 2011). However, in a study, baseline 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were not predictive of acute exacerbation in
 patients with severe COPD (Kunisaki et al., 2012). But the relationship between vitamin D and COPD has been
 reported in some studies. Also, it has been stated that total vitamin D intake was negatively associated with
 COPD (Shaheen et al., 2011). Regarding these results, vitamin D intake can be beneficial in COPD patients. This
 study aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D intake on COPD exacerbation and FEV1 in the patients with
 severe and very severe COPD. According to our knowledge, the effect of vitamin D on FEV1 and COPD
 exacerbations has been studied in few studies.
 
<section> In this study, vitamin D intake improved COPD exacerbations and FEV1 in the patients with severe and very
 severe COPD. Hornikx et al., reported that 100.000 IU of vitamin D per month for one year had improved
 maximal oxygen uptake and inspiratory muscle strength significantly in the COPD subjects who had followed a
 rehabilitation program (Hornikx et al., 2012). These findings can vindicate the results of our study.
 In a similar study, Lehouck et al., compared the effects of vitamin D and placebo on FEV1 and exacerbation rate
 in the patients with moderate to very severe COPD (Lehouck et al., 2012). In their study, each patient received
 100,000 IU of vitamin D every 4 weeks for 1 year. In contrast to our results, they reported that this dose of
 vitamin D had not improved FEV1 and exacerbation rate. This difference may be due to the difference between
 baseline serum vitamin D levels in these studies. Although serum vitamin D level was not determined in our
 study, some studies have stated that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in Iran. Studies suggest that Vitamin D
 increase production IL-10, an antiinflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, from T cells,
 increase production IL-37, antimicrobial peptide, regulate matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), shifting theTh1 and
 Th2 balance and reducing inflammation (Xystrakis et al., 2006, De Smet et al., 2005; Finklea et al., 2011). Taken
 together vitamin D intake (100,000 IU per 4 weeks for 6 months) improved COPD exacerbation and FEV1 in the
 patients with severe and very severe COPD significantly. It is suggested that baseline serum vitamin D levels be
 recorded in similar studies and the effect of vitamin D intake be evaluated regarding the baseline serum vitamin
 
<section> D levels.
