<section> Research in context
 
<section> Evidence before this study
 A PubMed search to identify articles published before
 July 31, 2021, was conducted using the following search terms
 with appropriate Boolean operators: “inactivated poliovirus
 vaccine”, “intradermal”, “vaccine derived poliovirus”,
 “campaign”, “pragmatic”, “meta-analysis”, “systematic review”,
 “randomized controlled trial”, “clinical trial”, “immunogenicity”,
 and “safety”. There were no language restrictions. Two meta-
 analyses published in 2019 and 2021, albeit including only one
 trial from a low-income country, which was conducted in
 The Gambia, have compared equivalent full-dose and
 fractional-dose inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) schedules.
 The seroconversion rates after a single fractional dose of IPV
 delivered by the intradermal route were lower than the
 seroconversion rates generated by a full intramuscular dose of
 the vaccine. Any difference in seroconversion after the second
 and third doses are progressively less than that after the
 first dose. Median antibody titres are consistently lower after
 fractional dose schedules than full-dose schedules. There are no
 definitive trials comparing needle and syringe (N&S) with
 intradermal adaptor (IDA) or the disposable syringe jet injector
 (DSJI) for intradermal fractional IPV (fIPV) dose administration.
 Nonetheless, two fIPV doses are more immunogenic that a
 single full dose of the vaccine as well as being dose sparing.
 In addition, intradermal fIPV boosts mucosal immunity in those
 previously primed with oral poliovirus vaccine in the same way
 as an intramuscular dose. Given progressive increases in
 (for type 2) and 2019 (for type 3). 3 Furthermore, WHO’s
 African Region was certified as being free of wild
 polioviruses on Aug 25, 2020.
 Both the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and the inactivated
 poliovirus vaccine (IPV) are essential to the Global Polio
 Eradication Initiative’s endgame strategy. 2,4 OPV induces
 systemic antibodies, protecting the individual from
 paralytic disease, but it also generates mucosal immunity,
 preventing the long-term excretion of the virus in the stool,
 and hence community transmission. 5 However, two key
 disadvantages of OPV are the occurrence, albeit rarely,
 of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis and the
 emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses
 (cVDPV) that are genetically divergent from the parent
 vaccine strain, are associated with person-to-person trans­
 mission, and can also cause paralytic disease. 6,7 Although
 IPV induces a systemic antibody response, it induces little
 or no mucosal immunity in those who have not previously
 received OPV. 5 In contrast, several studies have now shown
 that IPV boosts mucosal immunity more effectively than
 additional doses of OPV in those who have previously
 
<section> received OPV. 
<section> 8–10
 In April, 2016, a switch from the use of trivalent to
 bivalent OPV, containing only the Sabin type 1 and type
 strains, occurred worldwide. The switch aimed to reduce
 the occurrence of cVDPV, of which more than 85% of
 
<section> circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)
 outbreaks, waning type 2 population immunity, and the need to
 reserve IPV for routine immunisations, data to support country
 decisions regarding the use of intradermal fIPV in outbreak
 campaigns, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are needed.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 Fractional doses of IPV can be delivered reliably by the
 intradermal route using processes and personnel closely aligned
 to those used during a community outbreak response
 campaign in rural west Africa. The immune responses
 generated against poliovirus type 2 as well as against the type
 and 3 viruses are similar irrespective of whether the vaccine is
 administered by an N&S, a DSJI, or using an IDA. These
 responses are not substantially altered by injection quality and
 are independent of the amount of previous experience the
 vaccinator has at giving intradermal injections. Intradermal
 immunisation in the community is safe and well tolerated.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 Strong data are available to support the use of intradermal fIPV
 in community campaigns for cVDPV2 outbreaks, including in
 rural sub-Saharan Africa and in settings with high amounts of
 malnutrition, and also to support its use in campaigns designed
 to address the immunity gap in under-immunised populations.
 Countries facing cVDPV2 outbreaks should be encouraged to
 grasp the opportunity intradermal fIPV campaigns provide
 to prevent avoidable paralytic disease in this context.
 
<section> cases were attributable to the type 2 vaccine virus at
 the time. 2,6 However, although there were fewer than
 100 cVDPV2 cases in up to five different countries in 2017
 and 2018, there has subsequently been a sustained
 increase. More than 350 cases across 16 countries were
 detected in 2019, while more than 1000 cases across
 24 countries were detected in 2020. 11 Given the necessity
 to block community transmission, monovalent OPV
 type 2 campaigns have been the only available method
 of outbreak response. Consequently, although early
 outbreaks were largely seeded from trivalent OPV use
 before the switch, sequencing data confirm that new
 outbreaks have arisen from the use of monovalent OPV
 
<section> type
 To maintain individual protection from type 2 paralytic
 disease, the switch was supposed to be accompanied by
 the introduction of a dose of IPV into the schedule of all
 countries using only OPV. However, because of supply
 constraints, many countries were unable to introduce
 IPV or had vaccine stockouts. When combined with
 poor routine immunisation coverage in many countries,
 this has resulted in an estimated 143 million children
 across serial cohorts born since 2016, most of them in
 sub-Saharan Africa, who are yet to receive IPV and
 therefore do not have any vaccine-induced immunity

<section> Procedures
 
<section> All children received a single 0·1 mL dose (a fifth of
 a full dose) of IPV (Sanofi-Pasteur; Lyon, France) intra­
 dermally using one of three administration methods:
 by a 27 G × 10 mm fixed-needle, auto-disable N&S
 (Helm Medical, Hamburg, Germany); by an IDA
 (West Pharmaceutical Services, Eschweiler, Germany)
 in combination with a 27 G × 13 mm fixed-needle, auto-
 disable N&S (Helm Medical); or by a DSJI (Tropis;
 Pharmajet Golden, CO, USA; appendix p 3). A 0·5 mL
 dose of IPV contains IPV type 1 (Mahoney strain,
 40 D-antigen units), type 2 (MEF-1 strain, 8 D-antigen
 units), and type 3 (Saukett strain, 32 D-antigen units).
 Children were visited at home by trained field workers
 3 days after vaccination and solicited injection-site
 (tender­ness, erythema, and induration) and systemic
 (axillary temperature, vomiting, diarrhoea, reduced
 feeding, drowsiness, and irritability) adverse events
 data were collected and graded for severity according
 to protocol-defined criteria (appendix p 5). Unsolicited
 adverse events, including serious adverse events
 (hospital­ isations, deaths, life-threatening events, and
 events resulting in persistent incapacity), were recorded
 for 4 weeks after vaccination by asking parents to attend
 a study clinic in their community if their child had any
 health complaints. Unsolicited adverse events were
 graded for severity and relatedness to study vaccination.
 During the campaign, data on the size of the intra­
 dermal fluid bleb, fluid loss onto the skin, time taken to
 administer each vaccine, and the amount of distress
 apparent in the child were collected, as previously
 described. 20,21 The number of fIPV doses obtained from
 each vial according to administration method was
 calculated to assess vaccine waste.
 Children aged 24–59 months also had a follow-up
 2·0 mL blood sample collected 4 weeks after vaccination.
 This sample, and the one taken at baseline, were used to
 assess serum neutralising antibodies (SNA) titres against
 poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 according to established
 protocols at the Centers for Disease Control and
 Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA). 22 SNA titres, estimated
 using the Spearman-Kärber method, were reported as
 the reciprocal of the calculated 50% endpoint titre and
 reported to a maximum titre of 1448 or higher, which is
 the upper limit of quantification for the assay.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary immunogenicity outcome was the immune
 response to poliovirus type 2 generated after intradermal
 fIPV administration with either the DSJI or the IDA
 compared with the reference N&S. The percentage of
 children with a SNA titre of 8 or more in their baseline
 or post-vaccination blood samples defined the sero­
 prevalence at these points in the trial. 23 Seroconversion
 was defined as a baseline SNA titre of less than 8 and a
 post-vaccination titre of 8 or more. Among the children
 who had a baseline SNA titre of 8–362, the percentage
 who had a four-fold rise in their SNA titre in the post-
 vaccination sample was also established. The percentage
 of children who had an immune response to the vaccine
 was calculated by combining the percentage of children
 who seroconverted with those who had a four-fold rise in
 SNA titres. Children with a baseline titre of more than
 362 were excluded because a four-fold rise in SNA titres
 would have been beyond the upper limit of quantification
 for the assay.
 Immune responses to poliovirus types 1 and 3
 represented secondary immunogenicity objectives. Safety
 outcomes were the number and severity of solicited
 injection site and systemic adverse events on day 3 post-
 vaccination; the occurrence, severity, and relatedness of
 unsolicited adverse events; and serious adverse events in
 the 4 weeks after vaccination. An injection was defined to
 be of good quality if the fluid loss onto the skin was less
 than 10 uL and the bleb size was 5 mm or more.
 Additional qualitative data on vaccinator and parental
 experience was collected and will be reported separately.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 The immunogenicity analysis was done per protocol.
 This included all participants who received a vaccine
 during the campaign, had pre-vaccination and post-
 vaccination serological results available, and had no
 protocol deviations expected to affect the serological
 endpoints. Newcombe CIs (ie, a modified Wilson score
 for the difference between two proportions) were
 calculated for the difference between two immune
 response proportions. 24 Non-inferiority of the difference

 Baseline seropositivity was associated with an increase
 in immune response rates for types 1 and 3. There were
 no other consistent associations with the other variables
 analysed (appendix pp 8–10). Neither the designation of

 adverse event. Six children, two who received fIPV by
 each of the three administration methods, had a serious
 adverse event during the study. Four children were
 admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis
 or diarrhoea, one with a skin infection, and one with
 contusions after a road traffic accident. None of the
 serious adverse events were related to vaccination and all

 Discussion
 This trial established the immunogenicity and safety
 of intradermal fIPV when administered with an N&S,
 a DSJI, and an IDA in The Gambia. These results should
 allay concerns regarding the feasibility of delivering
 intradermal injections in large-scale outbreak response
 campaigns. For all three poliovirus types, the immuno­
 genicity of intradermal fIPV administered with either
 the DSJI or with the IDA was non-inferior to the
 immunogenicity of the same vaccine administered with
 an N&S. The vaccination was well tolerated by all three
 administration methods.
 The immunogenicity of intradermal fIPV has been
 examined in previous randomised controlled trials, albeit
 only one in sub-Saharan Africa. 10,15–18,26,28,29 Two meta-
 analyses published in 2019 and 2021 compared equivalent

 are lower than after the equivalent full-dose schedules and
 median antibody titres tend to be lower, irrespective of
 the dose number. 18,30 Nonetheless, fIPV used to boost
 immunity after OPV in infants results in substantially
 higher type 2 immune response rates than further OPV
 doses. 28 In trials conducted in low-income and middle-
 income countries, type 2 seroprevalence in young children
 boosted with intradermal fIPV after OPV ranges from
 approximately 90% to close to 100%. 16,26,28,31 Two fractional
 doses of IPV are more immunogenic than a single full
 dose at the same time as being dose sparing. 15,29 Fractional
 as well as full-dose IPV has also been shown to boost
 mucosal immunity in those who have previously received
 the oral vaccine, making it suitable for outbreak control. 10,17

<section> Despite such supportive data, a persistent concern
 regarding the rapid deployment of intradermal fIPV in
 campaigns to control cVDPV2 outbreaks is the feasibility
 of delivering intradermal injections on a large scale.
 Hence, there are concerns that the immunogenicity and
 safety data generated in trials might not be replicated
 during an outbreak. In 2016, more than 300 000 children
 were vaccinated with intradermal fIPV using N&S within
 14 days of detection of VDPV2 in Telangana, India.
 Although successful in terms of coverage, a large number
 of trained vaccinators had to be brought into the target
 area from other districts, which will not be feasible in
 many settings. 32 A report after another intradermal fIPV
 campaign, undertaken in Hyderabad, Pakistan, recorded
 little experience and incorrect vaccine administration as
 limitations to the use of N&S. 33 A study conducted in
 Karachi, Pakistan, during a catch-up campaign supported
 the feasibility of DSJI use in this context and also
 reported that 97·6% (578/592) of vaccinators and
 99·6% (4792/4813) of caregivers reported a preference
 for DSJI over the previous experience of intramuscular
 N&S vaccination. 34 Immunogenicity data were not col­
 lected in these campaigns and safety data were limited to
 the routine passive reporting of adverse events after
 immunisation.
 This study provides compelling data to support the
 use of intradermal fIPV in cVDPV2 outbreak response
 campaigns, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where
 they are most needed based on a rapidly increasing
 number of cVDPV2 outbreaks being reported. Neither
 the safety nor immunogenicity of intradermal fIPV was
 affected by the administration method used. All children
 who were seronegative to poliovirus type 2 at baseline
 seroconverted in response to a single dose of intra­
 dermal fIPV. High SNA titres were generated against all
 three polio­virus types, irrespective of the administration
 method. There was a weak association between injection
 quality and the immune response for poliovirus type
 However, the titres generated by all three administration
 methods were consistently high despite the difference
 in markers of injection quality. Because 20% of
 injections with the DSJI were associated with more
 than 20% vaccine loss, further dose reductions might be
 possible. The little effect that the previous experience
 administering intradermal injections of the vaccinator
 had on immune response rates also suggests that this is
 not a crucial determinant. The perceived importance of
 injection quality, reflecting the delivery of fIPV into
 the dermis rather than deeper tissue, is based on the
 presence of distinct antigen-presenting cells in this
 layer of the skin, considered able to compensate for
 the reduced antigen dose. 35 Although some adult data
 support this notion, a trial in infants suggests that fIPV
 delivered intramuscularly might offer similar protection
 to doses administered by the intradermal route. 36,37
 Our study also suggests that the immune responses
 generated by fIPV are robust and that the route of
 administration should not be a barrier, even when there
 are few experienced personnel.
 More than 25% more doses were obtained from each
 ten-dose vial when using the DSJI method than when
 using the N&S method. This increase reflects the standard
 requirement to overfill vials to account for the dead space
 in an N&S. Dead space in the DSJI has been minimised,
 with any overage drawn out of the vial during filling being
 returned to the vial as part of the priming process. In an
 outbreak campaign, the scale and focus of which are
 necessarily established by IPV availability, this provides
 the potential to increase campaign coverage by stretching
 the vaccine supply.
 Both the DSJI and the IDA have been endorsed by the
 Strategy Committee of the Global Polio Eradication
 Initiative for use in polio outbreak responses. The
 DSJI has been prequalified by WHO for intradermal
 immunisation. Although the unit cost of both delivery
 methods is considerably higher than for N&S delivery,
 analysis suggests that this cost might be largely offset
 when the effect of dose sparing and of operational costs,
 including the training of health workers, is included.
 The pragmatic nature of the trial, aiming to align
 procedures with those used to deliver campaigns with
 parenteral vaccines in The Gambia and other countries in
 sub-Saharan Africa, was a key strength of the study.
 These are the first immunogenicity and systematically
 collected safety data of intradermal fIPV delivered in
 the context of a campaign. Indeed, to the best of our
 knowledge, the trial design is novel and could be applied
 to other vaccines used in outbreak control or delivered
 through campaigns. Few children were excluded based on
 ineligibility. Although approximately a fifth of children
 were at least moderately stunted in height, this did not
 affect immune response rates, which should reassure
 those planning campaigns in other settings with high
 rates of malnutrition. The sample size was also exceeded,
 adding to the strength of the safety data and the confidence
 that can be placed in the immunogenicity data.
 The trial had some limitations. Participants were not
 individually randomly assigned, but rather had the vaccine
 administered using the method being used at the site
 they attended. Similarly, the parents were not masked.
 Although inherent to the trial design, both result in a risk
 of selection bias. Although there were some differences in
 the baseline demographic characteristics between groups,
 adjusting for these variables did not alter the inference
 from the non-inferiority analysis, and any effect is likely to
 be small given that the laboratory assessment was blinded.
 The number of vaccination teams was kept intentionally
 low to ensure a continuous flow of vaccinees at each
 vaccination point during the campaigns. We ensured
 the previous vaccination experience within each of the
 two vaccinator groups was similar. Nonetheless, each
 vaccinator’s inherent proficiency might have been differ­
 ent. The immunogenicity assessment was undertaken in
