<section> Background. An essential strategy to increase coverage of psychosocial treatments globally is task shifting to non-med-
 ical counsellors, but evidence on its eﬀectiveness is still scarce. This study evaluates the eﬀectiveness of lay psychosocial
 counselling among persons with psychological distress in a primary health care setting in rural Nepal.
 
<section> Methods. A parallel randomized controlled trial in Dang, rural Nepal (NCT03544450). Persons aged 16 and older
 attending primary care and with a General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) score of 6 or more were randomized (1:1)
 to receive either non-medical psychosocial counselling (PSY) or enhanced usual care (EUC). PSY was provided by lay
 persons with a 6-month training and consisted of 5-weekly counselling sessions of 35–60 min with a culturally adapted
 solution-focused approach. EUC was provided by trained primary health workers. Participants were followed up at
 (T1) and 6 months (T2). The primary outcome, response to treatment, was the reduction of minimum 50% in the Beck
 Depression Inventory (BDI) score.
 
<section> Results. A total of 141 participants, predominantly socially disadvantaged women, were randomized to receive PSY
 and 146 to EUC. In the PSY, 123 participants and 134 in the EUC were analysed. In PSY, 101 participants (81.4%)
 had a response compared with 57 participants (42.5%) in EUC [percentage diﬀerence 39.4% (95% CI 28.4–50.4)]. The dif-
 ference in BDI scores at T2 between PSY and EUC was −7.43 (95% CI −9.71 to −5.14).
 
<section> Conclusions. Non-medical (lay) psychosocial counselling appears eﬀective in reducing depressive symptoms, and its
 inclusion in mental health care should be considered in low-resource settings.

<section> Introduction
 
<section> There is a vast treatment gap in mental disorders glo-
 bally: approximately one in four persons with common
 mental disorders has received treatment (Alonso et al.,
 
<section> 2018; Araya et al., 2018). The gap is wider in develop-
 ing countries, where human resources for mental
 health are extremely scarce (Chisholm et al., 2016b;
 De Silva et al., 2014; Kakuma, 2011). In 2011 there
 was an estimated lack of 1.2 million mental health pro-
 fessionals in low and middle-income countries
 (Kakuma, 2011), and since then the global number of
 psychiatrists has decreased or remained stable
 (WHO, 2018).
 Psychosocial interventions, also in their culturally
 adapted forms, have been shown to be eﬀective in
 the treatment of common mental disorders
 (Chowdhary et al., 2014; De Silva et al., 2013).
 However, extending the availability of psychosocial
 interventions is particularly challenging, as they
 depend solely on the availability of human resources.
 Also, the focus on disease-speciﬁc treatment packages
 and stigma contribute to the low coverage of psycho-
 logical therapies (Singla et al., 2017). Providing psycho-
 social counselling for common mental disorders,
 without disease-speciﬁc focus, at a primary care setting
 might help overcome some of these challenges.
 One essential strategy to tackle this challenge of lack-
 ing workforce is task shifting (or task sharing), mean-
 ing ‘delegating tasks to existing or new cadres with
 either less training or narrowly tailored training’
 (Kakuma, 2011; Shidhaye et al., 2015). Traditionally,
 lay (non-medical) health workers have occupied sup-
 porting roles in mental health care, providing support
 to family members, ensuring adherence and assisting
 in outreach activities (Kakuma, 2011). Nevertheless,
 there are promising results of their role in providing
 psychological treatment (van Ginneken et al., 2013).
 A systematic review reported 27 trials of psychological
 treatments provided by nonspecialist providers with a
 combined eﬀect size of 0.49 in favour of the interven-
 tion (Singla et al., 2017). Other systematic reviews
 have also been carried out with similar ﬁndings
 (Joshi et al., 2014). An economic evaluation of one inter-
 vention showed it to be not only cost-eﬀective but also
 cost-saving (Buttorﬀ et al., 2012).
 Some limitations of the existing evidence are its lack
 of scale-up measures, lack of indigenous elements and
 the fact that a majority of studies have focused exclu-
 sively on women (Singla et al., 2017). The requirement
 of ongoing, structured supervision provided by
 experts has been considered a particular challenge for
 scale-up, and peer supervision could be one potential
 solution. Exploration of which indigenous elements
 would be eﬀective in lay counselling was considered
 a key element for further research (Singla et al., 2017).
 In this study in rural Nepal, we expanded previous
 research by using ﬂexible, non-structured supervision
 and included indigenous elements such as breathing
 exercises and relaxation to strengthen the cultural per-
 tinence of the intervention.
 Nepal is a low-income country facing many eco-
 nomic, political, environmental and social challenges,
 and has a high burden of mental disorders (Luitel
 et al., 2013). The treatment gap is particularly wide:
 according to a general population study, only 8% of
 persons with current depression had received any
 treatment, and only 2% attended primary care, while
 others had sought help from traditional healers and
 mental health professionals (Luitel et al., 2017). The
 barriers to seeking treatment relate to stigma and the
 high cost of care. There is a vast lack of human
 resources in the mental health sector: there are approxi-
 mately 50 psychiatrists and 20 psychologists in a coun-
 try of 29 million population (Luitel et al., 2015).
 Primary care workers are perceived as overburdened
 with multiple duties, and there is a lack of psycho-
 tropic medications and of monitoring and supervision
 in mental health (Luitel et al., 2015).
 The low available resources and high demand for
 mental health care highlight the need to assess alterna-
 tive options for delivering eﬀective treatments to psy-
 chological problems in Nepal. This study aimed to
 assess the eﬀectiveness of psychosocial counselling as
 practised by non-medical psychosocial counsellors in
 improving the mental health outcomes of persons
 with psychological distress in a primary health care
 setting in rural Nepal.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> We conducted a parallel randomized controlled trial
 with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The study has been regis-
 tered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03544450) and no
 changes in the methods occurred after trial registra-
 tion. The Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials
 (CONSORT) were followed for reporting the trial.
 
<section> Setting
 
<section> The study was carried out in Dang district, Western
 Nepal. Dang has a population of approximately
 000 and was one of the most aﬀected regions in the
 Nepal Maoist conﬂict (1996–2006). The intervention
 was carried out in two government health posts:
 Sisaniya and Gadawa health centres (Sisaniya has
 been upgraded to district hospital since the trial).
 These health posts were chosen because they were 
<section> considered to represent typical characteristics of the
 region, and were willing to cooperate in the study
 and provide the necessary physical space and assist-
 ance. The health posts cover areas of 21 000 and 12
 500 persons, respectively, and are staﬀed by health
 assistants, auxiliary nurse-midwives, nurses and mid-
 wives, and in Sisaniya also a medical doctor and
 administrative staﬀ. The health workers have 1.5–3
 years of formal training and are hired by the
 Ministry of Health.
 The study was carried out as part of a development
 cooperation project named ‘Developing a Community
 Model of Mental Health Care in Nepal’ funded by
 the Ministry for Foreign Aﬀairs, Finland. The project
 aimed to increase the availability of eﬀective treatment
 for mental health problems at government health facil-
 ities in Dang through outreach activities in the commu-
 nity; empowerment and advocacy eﬀorts; training
 primary health care workers in detection and treat-
 ment, and providing psychosocial counselling.
 Ethical permission was granted by the Nepal Health
 Research Council (NHRC).
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> Adults visiting Sisaniya and Gadawa health posts were
 informed about the study by the health workers and
 invited to participate. A written informed consent
 was obtained from potential participants, and consent-
 ing participants were then screened for eligibility by
 two research assistants. Inclusion criteria were: (1)
 age 16 years or older, (2) scoring 6 or above on the
 General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) (Koirala
 et al., 1999), (3) being able to ﬂuently communicate in
 Nepali, (4) residence in Dang for the subsequent
 months. The GHQ was scored as 0 or 1 for each ques-
 tion (GHQ scoring method), and a score of 7 or higher
 was deﬁned as psychological distress (Patel et al.,
 2008). Persons with severe illnesses or conditions
 requiring urgent attention, such as psychotic symp-
 toms or suicidality, were excluded and provided
 appropriate treatment (consultation of a psychiatrist
 and medication, if necessary). Suicidality was assessed
 with the question ‘Do you often think a lot about
 death, either your own, someone else’s, or death in
 general?’, and history of a psychotic disorder with
 the question ‘Has the person previously experienced
 a psychotic episode?’. This question was usually pre-
 sented to the accompanying person. Current psychotic
 symptoms were assessed clinically. Eligible partici-
 pants were invited to take part in the RCT.
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> The intervention was psychosocial counselling [19]
 consisting of ﬁve 45-min appointments, two in the
 ﬁrst week and weekly meetings in weeks 2–4. The
 intervention focuses on problem-solving, emotional
 support and coping strategies, and skills. On a theoret-
 ical level, the training programme was inﬂuenced by
 the principles of medical anthropology by Arthur
 Kleinman, such as being aware and encouraging trad-
 itional practices and local explanatory models and
 idioms of distress (Tol et al., 2005). The content of the
 training was tailored to individual participant needs,
 but included always the following components: (i)
 introduction, explanation, and rapport building; (ii)
 assessment of an understanding of the problem
 (including looking for positive assets); (iii) goal setting
 (asking the client what outcomes are preferred); (iv)
 problem management (exploring and identifying solu-
 tions, brainstorming, working with existing coping
 strategies, using social and cultural resources, and add-
 itional techniques such as relaxation and
 psycho-education); (v) implementation (making a
 plan of action and transition); and, ﬁnally, (vi) termin-
 ation of counselling. Details on the intervention have
 been published elsewhere (Jordans et al., 2003; Tol
 et al., 2005).
 The counsellors delivering the intervention were lay
 persons with a minimum of 12 years of education com-
 pleted who had received a 6-month training in psycho-
 social counselling provided by Centre for Victims of
 Torture. The training included components of theoret-
 ical background, basic therapeutic skills, components
 of cognitive-behavioural therapy, problem-solving,
 exposure therapy, yoga and meditation. Other require-
 ments for the counsellors were work experience in
 counselling (minimum 3 years), knowledge of Tharu
 language spoken in Dang, good communication skills,
 and ability to apply diﬀerent therapeutic techniques.
 Additionally, persons already living in Dang were
 prioritised in the recruitment, to increase the sustain-
 ability of the intervention.
 If needed, the counsellors had the opportunity to
 receive advice from senior counsellors or project dis-
 trict coordinator in person or a psychologist or medical
 doctor over the phone. Local and telephone supervi-
 sion was carried out as needed, typically 1–3 times a
 week. Additionally, ﬁeld supervision was organized
 every 2 months, when the team visited Dang. In the
 supervision meetings or phone calls, challenging
 cases were discussed, the supervisors helped the coun-
 sellors identify the main problem, and suggested suit-
 able techniques to address the problem.
 
<section> Enhanced usual care
 
<section> The comparator was enhanced usual care (EUC). EUC
 refers to the care available at the health posts given by
 health workers who had been trained by the 
<section> development cooperation project run by Centre for
 Victims of Torture and Physicians for Social
 Responsibility – Finland in which this study took
 place. The health workers at both health posts had
 received a 5-day training and a 3-day refresher training
 in detection and treatment of mental disorders.
 Psychotropic medication is supposedly available at
 the health posts according to government guidelines,
 but in practice the supply is inconsistent. Participants
 in both arms were free to seek help at the health post.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> All participants were assessed at the beginning of the
 intervention (T0), immediately after the study (T1,
 month) and after 6 months (T2) with the following
 instruments: (1) the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),
 21 item version (Beck et al., 1961; Kohrt et al., 2002),
 (2) the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (Beck et al.,
 
<section> 1988; Kohrt et al., 2004); and (3) the WHO Disability
 Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 12 item version 2.0
 (Üstün et al., 2010).
 The primary outcome, response to treatment, was
 deﬁned as a reduction of minimum 50% in the BDI
 21-item version (score range 0–63) from T0 to T2. The
 BDI is a self-reported depression questionnaire which
 been extensively validated. The study used the
 Nepali version, which showed acceptable overall val-
 idity and reliability (α 0.85) (Kohrt et al., 2002). Using
 a cut-oﬀ of 16/17, the speciﬁcity is 0.86 and sensitivity
 0.85. Items related to appetite loss, libido and being
 punished were considered more problematic in terms
 of validity and reliability, but their removal was not
 recommended. Secondary outcomes were mean reduc-
 tions in BDI, BAI, and WHODAS. The Nepali transla-
 tion of the BAI has also shown good validity and
 similar reliability to Western contexts (α 0.89), even
 though items related to somatic symptoms appeared
 to reduce the internal validity somewhat (Kohrt et al.,
 2004). The WHODAS, even though it has not been vali-
 dated in Nepal, has been used in other studies, and it
 was chosen for international comparability (Jordans
 et al., 2019).
 The initial trial sample size calculation was made
 with the plan of using BDI as a continuous outcome
 variable. However, later the primary outcome was
 deﬁned as a 50% reduction in the BDI since this out-
 come is widely used in other studies, has been vali-
 dated as corresponding to a clinical assessment of
 response (Riedel et al., 2010). No changes in the pri-
 mary outcome were made after data collection began.
 Data were collected by two research assistants who
 interviewed the participants and ﬁlled in the data in
 paper format and then entered it into an electronic
 data sheet. The research assistants had received a
 10-day training in research methodology and basic
 psychosocial support.
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> The sample size calculation aimed to detect a diﬀer-
 ence of three points on the BDI, leading to a minimum
 sample size of 132 participants in each group (power =
 0.80, signiﬁcance level 5%, two-tailed test).
 Considering the possible 30% attrition, the target for
 recruitment was 176 persons per group, 352 in total.
 
<section> Randomization
 
<section> Participants were randomized to either EUC or the
 psychosocial counselling intervention (PSY) using sim-
 ple randomization and an online randomization chart
 on 1:1 basis. After obtaining informed consent from
 the participant, the research assistants called the
 study coordinator, who carried out the randomization
 at a site remote from the trial location and gave the
 result on the phone. The allocation was thus concealed
 to participants and research assistants.
 
<section> Blinding
 
<section> Blinding of participants and research counsellors was
 not possible due to the nature of the intervention.
 The baseline, 1-month and 6-month assessments were
 performed by research assistants who had received a
 5-day training and were blinded to the allocation status
 of the participants.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> We used descriptive statistics to assess the balance
 between trial arms at baseline. The primary
 between-group analysis was carried out using an
 intention-to-treat approach. Multilevel mixed-eﬀects
 models were used to account for the correlation
 among the repeated observations of the same subject
 over time (Tang & Tu, 2012). Mixed models allow to
 vary the number of observations within each partici-
 pant, handling missing data more eﬀectively than
 other analytical approaches (O’Connell et al., 2017;
 Rahman et al., 2016). The likelihood ratio (LR) test
 was used to compare the multilevel model with a
 single-level regression. We also used the LR test to
 examine diﬀerences by health post, which did not
 improve the ﬁt of the model (p < 0.00001). Therefore,
 we only adjusted for the repeated measurements and
 not for clustering at the health post level.
 The primary outcome (response to treatment)
 was calculated using the following formula:
 
<section> BDI 6m − BDI baseline × 100. This per cent change
 
<section> BDI baseline
 
<section> was then dichotomized into 1 (50% or more) or 
<insert> Fig. 1. Flow chart of study participation. 
<iend>

 (less than 50%). A multilevel mixed-eﬀects logistic
 regression model was ﬁtted. Time as dummy variables
 and an interaction term between intervention group
 and time (as dummy variable) were included as ﬁxed
 eﬀects and participant as a random eﬀect. Predicted
 margins were used to obtain predicted proportions
 and percentage diﬀerence between intervention
 groups and 95% conﬁdence intervals. We used the
 melogit command that integrates ﬁxed and random
 eﬀects since version 14 of Stata.
 Similar analyses were carried out for secondary out-
 comes using linear mixed-eﬀects models. The model
 adjusts for baseline values to account for regression
 to the mean. Diﬀerences in mean scores were obtained
 from equation coeﬃcients (Twisk et al., 2018). The stan-
 dardized mean diﬀerence for BDI was calculated by
 dividing the diﬀerence in mean scores by the pooled
 standard deviation using the formula from da Costa
 et al. (2012). Mean BDI, BAI, and WHODAS at baseline,
 T1 and T2 were obtained by calculating predicted ﬁt-
 ted values which integrate ﬁxed and random eﬀects.
 All analyses were carried out with Stata version 14.2
 (Stata Corp., 2015). The code is available upon request.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> A total of 141 participants were randomized to receive
 psychosocial counselling (PSY) and 146 participants
 were randomized to EUC (Fig. 1). Data collection
 began in May 2016 and ended in October 2017.
 Seven persons were excluded at the screening phase
 due to psychotic symptoms, and no one for suicidality.
 No participants had suicidal behaviour during the
 study, and no participant was excluded during the

 study. Participants at baseline were predominantly
 female, with a low level of education, and married
 with large families (Table 1).
 Follow-up at T2 was achieved for 87.9% of the inter-
 vention group and for 91.8% in the control group. Total
 attrition was 10.1%. Reasons for lost to follow-up are
 described in Fig. 1.
 Table 2 shows the response to treatment by interven-
 tion group. In PSY, 101 participants out of 124 (80.5%)
 had a response (>50% reduction in BDI score), com-
 pared with 57 participants out of 134 (41.1%) in EUC.
 The percentage diﬀerence of PSY v. EUC was 39.4%
 (95% CI 28.4–50.4).
 The mean diﬀerences adjusted for baseline values in
 BDI, BAI, and WHODAS between T0 and T2 are
 shown in Table 3. At T2, the scores were 6.6 (95% CI
 5.5–7.6) in PSY and 14.0 (95% CI 12.7–15.3) in EUC.

<section> Adherence to the intervention
 
<section> The trial was planned to encompass ﬁve sessions, how-
 ever, for more severe cases, one–two additional
 appointments were scheduled if requested by the par-
 ticipants. Altogether 104 participants (74.4%) received
 a minimum of ﬁve sessions (61 participants received
 six sessions and nine participants seven sessions).
 The mean number of sessions received was 5.2. The
 duration of treatment sessions was 35–60 min, which
 in some cases diﬀered somewhat from the planned
 45 min due to study participants’ preferences.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the
 eﬀectiveness of non-medical health worker-led psycho-
 social counselling in a rural setting in Nepal. The inter-
 vention was remarkably eﬀective: 81% of persons who
 received the intervention had a response (minimum
 50% reduction in BDI score), compared with 41% of
 persons in the control group. Also, secondary out-
 comes, the BAI and the WHODAS, showed a substan-
 tial reduction that was larger in the intervention than
 in the control group.
 
<section> Comparison with previous studies
 
<section> The magnitude of the eﬀect of our intervention is in
 line with a meta-analysis of 27 trials of lay psychosocial
 treatments that found a standardized mean diﬀerence
 of 0.49 (Singla et al., 2017). The review identiﬁed diﬀer-
 ent elements of lay psychological treatments of which
 the interpersonal, emotional, and nonspeciﬁc engage-
 ment showed the strongest association with interven-
 tion eﬀectiveness (Singla et al., 2017). Our
 intervention emphasized the engagement between
 the client and the counsellor and interpersonal ele-
 ments, which are culturally relevant content.
 Approaches such as breathing exercises and relaxation
 are widely used in Nepal to relieve stress (Pramanik
 et al., 2010; Naik et al., 2018), and we consider them a
 cultural adaptation in this counselling intervention.
 Surprisingly, relaxation was one of the least often
 used methods in other similar trials (Singla et al., 2017).

 The structure and delivery method of our interven-
 tion were similar to the majority of other studies
 reviewed by Singla et al. (2017). In most studies, the
 psychological treatment was delivered by community
 health workers, followed by peers or lay persons, as
 in our case.
 Varying deﬁnitions of lay health workers exist: for
 example, in the successful trial of Chibanda et al.
 
<section> (2011), health workers received a 9-day training in
 counselling skills and problem-solving therapy. In
 terms of training length, this is close to the training
 provided in this trial to the health workers providing
 EUC (5 days of training and 3 days of refresher
 training), although the content was not focused on
 counselling. In the literature, the duration of the
 training for nonspecialist providers has varied from
 3 h to 2 months (Singla et al., 2017). Compared to
 this, the 6-month training of the counsellors in
 this study is signiﬁcantly longer and could have con-
 tributed to our high response rate and low drop-out
 rate. Therefore, the generalization of these results to
 settings with less trained or experienced lay counsel-
 lors is not straightforward. On the other hand, the
 mean duration of the treatments in the review was
 10 weeks with a mean of 9.6 sessions, whereas the

 the intervention. However, the tuition fee of training
 one person as a counsellor is approximately 1000
 USD, and after the initial investment, the trained lay
 counsellors are able to provide eﬀective treatment
 with relatively little support, as seen in this study.
 Additionally, in the development project that this
 research was related to, counsellors with the same
 training and experience had other responsibilities in
 addition to counselling: they had a supervisory and
 supporting role with the government health workers
 and female health volunteers providing basic psycho-
 social support, and run outreach workshops at
 communities and schools. Therefore, well-trained psy-
 chosocial counsellors can potentially have a key role in
 mental health care at the local level beyond the provi-
 sion of counselling services.
 Recently, a systematic review conﬁrmed that psy-
 chotherapy may substantially reduce psychological
 symptoms in areas that have suﬀered from disasters
 and conﬂict (Purgato et al., 2018). The psychotherapies
 in the reviewed trials were mostly provided by mental
 health professionals. This study demonstrates that also
 non-medical health worker-led counselling can be use-
 ful in a region that has suﬀered a recent violent conﬂict
 and several natural disasters.
 The reason for using lay health workers to provide
 psychosocial therapies is simple: there will never be
 enough mental health professionals in any country to 
<section> deliver psychological treatments for all that could beneﬁt
 from them. In addition to speciﬁc techniques, non-
 speciﬁc qualities such as the ability to form an empathic
 relationship should also be assessed when recruiting lay
 therapists (Singla et al., 2017). Strong support and super-
 vision is generally considered a requirement for eﬀective
 lay person delivered mental health care (Barnett et al.,
 2018) and could be a challenge for scaling up these inter-
 ventions (Singla et al., 2017). However, in this study,
 supervision was provided ﬂexibly as needed by other,
 more experienced counsellors, a ﬁeld coordinator, and
 a medical doctor by phone, and did not require an exces-
 sive amount of resources. Based on this experience, it
 appears that a structured, intensive supervision system
 may not be mandatory for successful lay counselling,
 as long as some support is available when needed.
 Nevertheless, this approach to supervision requires
 adequately trained and experienced lay counsellors.
 Thus, compared with earlier literature, this study
 demonstrates that the requirements for supervision
 and length of the intervention may be less than previ-
 ously thought if it is delivered by adequately trained
 lay counsellors. Moreover, adding indigenous ele-
 ments, such as relaxation and breathing exercises,
 may be beneﬁcial for eﬀectiveness.
 Additionally, it should be noted that the study was
 carried out in the context of a development cooper-
 ation project by two NGOs. It is our ﬁrm belief that
 development projects should apply evidence-based
 interventions, and if possible, should try to incorporate
 elements to assess their eﬀectiveness with rigorous sci-
 entiﬁc methods.
 This study was part of a development cooperation
 project that created structures to support the provision
 of mental health services in the district in the future:
 with support of local authorities, district and village
 level mental health committee were founded, in add-
 ition to training of health workers and sensitization
 of the population through various outreach activities.
 This broader approach not only aided in the recruit-
 ment of study participants but also helped to sustain
 the eﬀorts. After 6 years of continuous work in the dis-
 trict, mental health is now incorporated into local pri-
 mary health care, and counsellors were trained and
 hired by local health authorities to work at the health
 posts. After suﬃcient training, primary health workers
 have been content with their role of providing basic
 psychosocial support and referring to counsellors if
 needed, while counsellors have also had a supervisory
 role, and mental health care is provided as an integral
 part of primary health care.
 
<section> Limitations
 
<section> Some limitations of the study should be noted. First,
 the study population included few men, and therefore
 the eﬀectiveness of the intervention could not be
 assessed, and the results of the study cannot be gener-
 alized to men. Second, the follow-up did not extend
 beyond 6 months, and the long-term impact of the
 intervention is unknown. Third, we were not able to
 collect detailed information on other treatments
 received, such as the use of antidepressant or other
 medication or possible visits to other health-related
 local resources such as traditional healers. However,
 the study counsellors did not prescribe medications,
 and therefore any diﬀerences between the two groups
 are not likely to be due to the use of psychotropic
 medication. Fourth, even though randomization proce-
 dures were adhered to, there were some diﬀerences
 between the two study groups in relation to education.
 Fifth, the sample size calculation was based on the ini-
 tial idea of using continuous BDI as the primary out-
 come, but later, a categorical outcome of 50%
 reduction in BDI was chosen. However, the sample
 size was suﬃcient for the categorical outcome and
 the study was adequately powered to detect the impact
 of the intervention. Finally, the impact of caste was not
 assessed speciﬁcally in this trial. Over half of the parti-
 cipants were Tharus, an indigenous underprivileged
 population residing in the Southern Himalaya
 Region. Low castes (Dalit/Nepali) have been found to
 have a greater prevalence of depression and anxiety
 when compared with high castes. In Nepal, caste is
 an important mediator of mental health (Kohrt et al.,
 2009), and its impact should be assessed in further
 trials.
 
<section> Conclusions
 
<section> Upscaling the availability of psychosocial treatments is
 a global challenge. In the past, the global mental health
 movement has been criticized for being excessively
 focused on the biomedical treatments for mental disor-
 ders, but recently, eﬀorts have been made to include
 more psychosocial components into basic care
 packages (Hanlon et al., 2016). This randomized con-
 trolled trial showed the eﬀectiveness of non-medical
 led psychosocial counselling in reducing depressive
 and anxiety symptoms and disability in a challenging
 post-conﬂict low-income setting. Further trials in
 Nepal should be scaled-up nationwide to provide
 more generalizable ﬁndings. Low and middle-income
 countries should consider including lay psychosocial
 counselling as an integral part of mental health
 systems.
