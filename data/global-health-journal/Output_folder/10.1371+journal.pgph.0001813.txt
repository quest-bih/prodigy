<section> Abstract
 
<section> We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial among patients initiating treatment for
 drug-sensitive tuberculosis (TB). Participants received real-time electronic adherence moni-
 tors and were randomized (1:1:1) to: (i) daily SMS (reminders to TB patients and notifica-
 tions to social supporters sent daily for 3 months, then triggered by late or missed dosing for
 3 months); (ii) weekly SMS (reminders to TB patients and notifications to social supporters
 sent weekly for 3 months, then triggered by late or missed dosing for 3 months); or (iii) con-
 trol (no SMS). Feasibility was mainly verified by the technical function of the intervention at
 Month 6. The primary outcome was percent adherence as ascertained by the real time mon-
 itor. Quantitative feasibility/acceptability data were summarized descriptively. Percentage
 adherence and adherence patterns were assessed and compared by linear regression mod-
 els. Qualitative acceptability data was collected through interviews and analyzed using con-
 tent analysis. Among 63 participants, the median age was 35 years, 75% had no regular
 income, and 84% were living with HIV. Feasibility was demonstrated as most of the daily
 [1913/2395 (80%)] and weekly [631/872 (72%)] SMS reminders to TB patients were sent
 successfully. Also, most of the daily [1577/2395 (66%)] and weekly [740/872 (85%)] SMS
 notifications to social supporters and adherence data (96%) were sent successfully. Chal-
 lenges included TB status disclosure, and financial constraints. All patients perceived the
 intervention to be useful in reminding and motivating them to take medication. Median
 adherence (IQR) in the daily SMS, weekly SMS, and control arms was 96.1% (84.8, 98.0),
 92.5% (80.6, 96.3), and 92.2% (56.3, 97.8), respectively; however, differences between the

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Worldwide, nearly 10 million people develop tuberculosis (TB) and nearly 2 million people
 from TB annually [1]. Low income countries account for more than 90% of TB cases and
 deaths [2]. Uganda faces a high burden of TB and is listed among the 30 countries with the
 highest rates of TB and TB/HIV co-infection [2], with an annual TB incidence of 196 (95% CI
 117–296) per 100,000 overall and 65 (95% CI 39–98) per 100,000 people living with HIV [3].
 In Uganda, an estimated 223 people acquire TB daily and 30 deaths due to TB occur [3].
 Importantly, TB is the number one cause of death among individuals living with HIV [4].
 While TB treatment is freely available in Uganda, treatment adherence challenges remain [5].
 Causes of non-adherence to TB medication include depression and alcohol [6], lack of trans-
 port to the clinics to pick up drugs, [5] and forgetfulness [7]. Non-adherence to TB medication
 contributes to disease transmission, drug resistance, and treatment failure [8–10].
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has long recommended directly observed therapy
 (DOT), which requires taking medication under the supervision of a health worker or trained
 treatment supporter [11]. However, the implementation of DOT has been limited in many set-
 tings for several reasons; DOT requires a significant time commitment from people living with
 TB, healthcare workers, and treatment supporters and places financial burdens on TB patients
 when they travel to the clinic for DOT administration [12,13]. DOT may also infringe on TB
 patients’ autonomy [14]. Moreover, for preventing disease relapse and acquired drug resis-
 tance, DOT may not perform better than self-administered therapy [15]. Alternative, novel
 methods are needed for effective management of TB medication adherence especially in set-
 tings where DOT’ implementation is challenging and/or undesirable. Recognizing this need,
 the WHO now recommends using digital adherence technologies to support TB medication
 adherence as part of its End TB Strategy [16]. Examples of such technologies include SMS
 reminders and digital medication monitors (i.e., devices that send signals when opened as a
 proxy for taking medication). Importantly, real-time adherence monitors can enable the provi-
 sion of timely interventions to address non-adherence before TB patients experience the con-
 sequences of non-adherence. Real-time adherence monitoring linked with SMS reminders has
 been shown to be feasible and acceptable [17] and to improve adherence to antiretroviral ther-
 apy (ART) [18]. However, few quality studies have investigated these technologies for TB med-
 ication adherence, especially in low resource settings, and the modest prevailing studies report
 mixed results [19–23]. In addition, the role for SMS in activating social support among TB
 patients has not been well studied, and research is needed on the integration of supportive
 SMS notifications to real-time monitoring of TB medication adherence.
 We therefore conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the use of:
 i) real-time adherence monitors, ii) SMS as adherence reminders to TB patients, and iii) SMS
 notifications to their social supporters (i.e., friends or family who have helped them with medi-
 cation or other needs previously) to support TB medication adherence in southwestern
 Uganda. We previously published formative qualitative findings from the current study 
<section> demonstrating that real-time adherence monitors and SMS can potentially enhance TB medi-
 cation adherence by reminding them to take TB medication, and giving them opportunities
 demonstrate their commitment to medication adherence through monitoring [24]. Partici-
 pants also reported that SMS notifications to social supporters can motivate medication adher-
 ence by creating a personal sense of commitment to adhere to medication in response to the
 helping hand extended by social supporters [5]. The current paper reports on the feasibility,
 acceptability and the preliminary impact of this intervention composed of a real-time device
 that monitors how TB patients take their medication, SMS reminders to patients and SMS
 notifications to their social supporters.
 
<section> Materials and methods
 
<section> Ethics statement
 
<section> All participants provided signed informed consent before study participation. The institutional
 review committees of Mbarara University of Science and Technology (Protocol number: 16/
 10–16), and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (Protocol number: HS
 2189).
 
<section> Study design and setting
 
<section> This study reports the quantitative and qualitative results from a pilot RCT among people with
 drug-sensitive TB recruited from the TB Clinic within Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital
 (MRRH) in southwestern Uganda. The TB clinic at MRRH provides care to an estimated
 TB patients annually. At the TB Clinic, newly diagnosed TB patients receive free TB medication
 and are counseled about the benefits of TB medication. The DOT approach is not employed for
 monitoring medication adherence at MRRH due to the costs for both TB patients and within
 the healthcare system. Instead, TB patients self-administer therapy with isoniazid, rifampin,
 pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for two months (2RHZE; intensive phase), followed by isoniazid
 plus rifampin for four months (4HR; continuation phase). The clinic verbally encourages
 patients to adhere to their medication. The TB treatment regimens use fixed-dose combination
 tablets TB patients return to the TB Clinic every two weeks for the first two months, including
 for a sputum examination to ensure conversion to negative results prior to the continuation
 phase. Those with positive test result receive GeneXpert to exclude rifampicin resistance. Treat-
 ment can be extended up to a full year to account for missed medication refills or doses.
 
<section> Selection of study participants
 
<section> Between May 2019 and June 2020, we randomly recruited TB patients if they met the following
 inclusion criteria: a) being age 18 years and older, b) being newly diagnosed with TB per clinic
 records (within a month of initiating treatment), b) initiating drug-sensitive TB treatment at
 the MRRH TB Clinic, c) living in Mbarara District (within 20 km of MRRH), d) knowing how
 to use SMS, e) owning a cellphone for personal use, and f) having reliable cellular network at
 home. Before enrollment in the study, cellular reception was assessed by the research assistants
 who escorted participants in their homes to check the signal of the networks supported by the
 technology used in this study either MTN or Airtel. The exclusion criteria were an unwilling-
 ness or inability to have cellular reception confirmed at home and/or to give consent to be in
 the study. Inclusion criteria for social supporters were a) being age 18 years and older, b) living
 in the Mbarara District, c) having an ongoing relationship with the TB patients(e.g., friend or
 family member), d) owning a cell phone for personal use, and e) knowing how to use SMS.
 The only exclusion criterion was being unwilling or unable to give consent. 
<section> The intervention technology
 
<section> The intervention was composed of a real-time device that monitors how TB patients take their
 medication as described elsewhere [17,24], the real-time adherence monitor (Wisepill Tech-
 nologies, Cape Town, South Africa) is a medication container that holds up to 28 tablets of
 RHZE. The real-time adherence monitor has an internal modem and subscriber identity mod-
 ule (SIM) card enable the device to send a real-time mobile signal to a secure web server
 (hosted in South Africa) by General Packet Radio Service. When opened to take pills, the
 device records a date-and-time stamp; receipt of this signal is interpreted as a proxy for taking
 medication. The device stores records of openings in the event of inadequate mobile network
 coverage and sends them when the network becomes available. The monitor additionally
 sends a daily “heartbeat” to confirm device functionality. The monitor can be charged using
 electricity or a solar device; its battery life is typically six months. Additionally, the intervention
 involved SMS reminders (scheduled and/or triggered by missed or delayed dosing) to TB
 patients to help them take their medications, as well as SMS notifications to their social sup-
 porters to provide the TB patients with assistance if possible. The content of SMS reminders
 and notifications were determined by each participant. The default message for both TB
 patients and social supporters was “This is your reminder.” SMS were sent from Wisepill tech-
 nologies at no cost to participants at their specific time of taking medication.
 
<section> Outcome measures
 
<section> The primary outcome was percent adherence ascertained by the real time monitor. Secondary
 outcomes were feasibility which was verified by the technical function of the intervention
 including the number of SMS sent as planned, number of SMS not sent as planned, number
 SMS sent later due to a delay or absence of the corresponding signal, data loss by the real-time
 monitor, monitor malfunctioning, taking medication from other sources, and opening the
 device without taking medication. Acceptability of the intervention was verified by the partici-
 pant’s preference of SMS type and frequency, ease of use of the real-time monitor, possibility
 of unintended TB status disclosure.
 
<section> Study procedures
 
<section> TB patients were followed for six months. A random number generator (random allocation
 was generated by the study coordinator) and the CONSORT diagram and the CONSORT
 checklist (S1 Checklist) (Fig 1 below) were used to determine study arm assignments by the
 study team. After screening and consenting, all participants received a real-time adherence
 monitoring device and were randomized 1:1:1 as follows:
 
<section> 1. 
<section> Daily SMS + real-time adherence monitor -> triggered SMS (‘daily SMS arm’): Daily
 SMS reminders and notifications were sent to the TB patients depending on their specific
 time of medication taking and social supporter participants, respectively, for the first three
 months. For the next three months, SMS reminders and notifications were sent only if the
 monitor was not opened within an hour of the expected time.
 
<section> 2. 
<section> Weekly SMS + real-time adherence monitor -> triggered SMS (weekly SMS arm):
 Weekly SMS reminders and notifications were sent for the first three months to TB patients
 and social supporter participants, respectively. For the next three months, SMS reminders
 and notifications were sent only if the monitor was not opened within an hour of the
 expected time.

<section> 3. 
<section> Real-time adherence monitoring only (control arm): No SMS were sent to TB patients or

<section> Social supporters were identified by study participants at enrollment and were enrolled into
 the study at the same time with the patients TB patients. Social supporters were generally
 encouraged to provide support (e.g. medication reminders, counseling, or transport to the
 clinic) necessary for enabling study participants take their medication well, if possible.
 To manage potential strain on relationships and harmonize expectations [25], the research
 assistants (WT and ATM) provided orientation to TB patients and social supporters at recruit-
 ment in which we clarified their roles and highlighted the potential negative effect of non-
 responsiveness (not taking medication as expected) on relationships.
 
<section> Data collection
 
<section> Study participants completed baseline questionnaires (S1 Text) regarding socio-demographics,
 health, depression [26], food insecurity [27], alcohol use [28], social support [29], TB stigma
 [30], and socioeconomic status [30]. Adherence data was comprised of signals sent to the
 study server after opening the real-time adherence monitor. Feasibility data was obtained by 
<section> tracking SMS sent and received, and monitor and battery functionality. Participant opinion
 feasibility and acceptability data was also captured through the study exit pilot-tested question-
 naires and qualitative interviews. The development of the questionnaires and interview guide
 was informed by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model
 [31]. At study exit (month 6), authors WT and ATM (male study research assistants trained
 qualitative research, research ethics and Data management with a PhD and MBA respectively)
 conducted semi-structured, face to face in-depth interviews with TB patients in a private space
 at a research office near the MRRH until reaching thematic saturation at the th participant.
 Prior to data collection, the researchers had interacted with the participants at enrollment.
 Each interview lasted between 30 and 60 minutes and was conducted in the local language
 (Runyankole), digitally recorded, transcribed, and translated to English. The interviewers elic-
 ited participants’ experiences of using each component of technologies (real-time monitor,
 SMS reminders for TB patients, and SMS notifications for social supporters) including benefits
 and challenges related to the technologies. Following each interview, author AM (with support
 from JEH and JLD) reviewed transcripts for quality, clarity, and detail.
 
<section> Analysis
 
<section> Feasibility and acceptability data were summarized descriptively. In the primary dataset for
 assessment of adherence, adherence was computed for each participant as the total number
 device openings divided by the total number of study follow-up days, excluding days when a
 participant was considered not to have used the device (e.g., when the device was non-func-
 tional as evidenced by no device heartbeat). Adherence data for TB patients who died was
 included up until death; data were also excluded at loss to follow-up (at the onset of missing
 data), which was defined as having no contact or adherence data for two months per protocol
 analysis. Participants were excluded if they voluntarily withdrew from the study or declined
 use the adherence monitor. SMS data for TB patients was determined by the Wisepill device
 regards to SMS reminders that were sent as planned, those not sent or delayed due to technical
 challenges like poor network and those sent due to a delay or absence of the corresponding sig-
 nal. In a secondary analysis, days between loss to follow-up and study completion were consid-
 ered non-adherence. To assess the effect of each intervention on adherence compared to the
 control, we used linear regression models with robust standard errors, given the pilot nature
 the RCT and the potential for residual confounding in a small sample size. First, we built uni-
 variable models considering all potential confounders, which included age, gender, marital sta-
 tus, type of residence, disclosure of TB status to anyone other than their healthcare provider,
 severe food insecurity, alcohol use, stigma, social support, depression, HIV status, social eco-
 nomic status, study phase (less or equal to 2 months of treatment vs more than 2 months of
 treatment) and level of education [32] and controlled for the study arm. In the multivariable
 model, we considered those confounders with a univariable p value <0.2. Analysis was con-
 ducted in Stata version 13. In both primary and secondary analysis, the statistician was not
 blinded to allocation assignments since this was an open label trial.
 Qualitative data was analyzed using content analysis [33] to generate categories summariz-
 ing TB patients’ experiences of using the technologies, focusing on perceived usefulness and
 challenging issues counting for effort, social influences and facilitators. AM assembled a code-
 book from the identified categories, using an iterative process, which included developing
 codes, writing operational definitions, and selecting illustrative quotes. AM then applied codes
 using NVIVO 11. Qualitative findings are reported according to COREQ guidelines
 (S1 Checklist) [34]. The pilot trial was reported according to the Consolidated Standards of
 Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline [35]. 
<section> Results
 
<section> Participant characteristics
 
<section> Of 126 TB patients screened, 66 (52%) were enrolled in the study between January 2019 and
 December 2019. TB patients participants were randomized to three arms: daily SMS arm
 (N = 22), weekly SMS arm (N = 23) and the control arm (N = 21). Reasons for excluding par-
 ticipants are shown in Fig 1. All 45 social supporters identified by the TB patients in the two
 SMS arms were enrolled in the study.
 Overall, the primary analysis considered 22 TB patients in the daily SMS arm, 20 TB
 patients in the weekly SMS arm, and 21 TB patients in the control arm, totaling to 63 TB
 patients. However, due to the three patients who died from the daily SMS arm and one who
 died and the other one who was lost to follow up (due to unreachable contact in the control
 arm), we only had 58 TB patients at study exit; 19 TB patients in the daily SMS arm, 20 in the
 weekly SMS arm, and 19 in the control arm. Of the 45 social supporters, three were disenrolled
 all from the weekly SMS arm after 3.5, 6.5, and 12.2 weeks respectively and their data was
 excluded for analysis because of disenrollment of their corresponding TB patients. Data from
 the three social supporters whose TB patients died (from the daily SMS arm) before complet-
 ing the study were included for analysis. Overall, a total of 39 social supporters completed the
 study. As indicated in Table 1 below, of 63 TB patients, 32 (59%) were male, 53 (84%) had co-
 infection with HIV, and 47 (75%) had no regular income.
 Of the 42 social supporters, 28 (66%) were female, 16 (38%) had HIV, and 32 (22%) had no
 regular income.
 
<section> Feasibility and acceptability
 
<section> SMS reminders and notifications. All participants reported that SMS were easy to use
 (i.e., access and read). As indicated in Table 2 below, most of the daily [1913/2395 (80%)] and
 weekly SMS reminders [631/872 (72%)] were sent successfully. Also, most of the daily [1577/
 2395 (66%)] and weekly SMS notifications [740/872 (85%)], were sent successfully. Only 161/
 2395 (7%) of SMS were sent later due to a delay or absence of the corresponding signal. The
 sending of these SMS reminders occurred when the electronic adherence monitor had already
 been opened by the patients to take medication, but there was delay or absence of the corre-
 sponding signal due technical issues (such as poor network coverage). Most TB patients in the
 weekly SMS arm (n = 17; 89%) wished they had received daily SMS reminders to triggered
 SMS reminders. Responses from the open-ended question on reasons for the stated prefer-
 ences revealed that daily SMS reminders matched well with daily pill taking and provided
 encouragement to TB patients daily, while triggered SMS texts were received after the sched-
 uled pill taking time. The majority of the TB patients in the weekly arm (n = 16; 80%) preferred
 triggered SMS to weekly, reporting that weekly SMS reminders did not match well with daily
 pill taking. The majority of participants (n = 29; 74%) preferred personalized SMS reminders
 formulated by themselves (e.g. “How are you today”) to the default SMS formulated by the
 study (i.e. “This is your reminder”).
 
<section> SMS notifications to social supporters. As indicated in Table 2 above, most of the daily
 [1577/2395 (66%)] and weekly SMS notifications [740/872 (85%)] were sent successfully.
 From the survey results, all social supporters (n = 39; 100%) reported providing some assis-
 tance to the participants at least once, after receiving SMS notifications. The assistance that
 involved some form of financial spending (such as providing money for transport to the clinic,
 buying food) was provided least often (n = 20; 51%) Non-monetary support such as emotional
 support was the most common support provided (n = 38; 97%). The majority of the social

 supporters from both the daily (n = 14; 74%) and weekly (n = 15; 75%) SMS arms respectively
 preferred triggered SMS notifications to daily or weekly SMS notifications. Social supporters
 (n = 24; 62%) reported improved relationships with their TB patients (e.g., frequent communi-
 cation with each other) as a result of participating in this study. Many social supporters
 (n = 25; 64%) reported instances of failing to provide the assistance required by the TB
 patients, mainly due to lack of money (n = 15; 60%).
 
<section> Real-time adherence monitor. As indicated in Table 3, all TB patients (n = 58; 100%)
 reported that using the real-time monitor: a) was useful in their TB medication adherence
 including being more useful than the pill sackets often used for TB medication; b) helped them
 take their medication in time/as prescribed; d) positively affected the way they felt about taking
 medicine; e) and made it easier for TB patients to take their medication. All participants also
 found the real-time monitor easy to use (e.g., opening and closing). Ten (18%) of TB patients
 reported ever taking pills from another source during the study period during travel or when
 they had not refilled the monitor, while 8 (14%) of TB patients reported opening the monitor
 without taking medication during refilling the monitor as well as accidental openings.
 
<section> Acceptability of the technologies. As shown in Table 4 below, results from exit interviews
 indicated that receiving an SMS reminder and looking at the monitor reminded TB patients take
 their medications on time. Additionally, TB patients reported that being sent an SMS reminder
 and being monitored implied care and motivated medication taking. Also, TB patients reported
 receiving social support (e.g., reminders, counseling) from social supporters in response the SMS
 notifications received. Challenges reported by participants included possibility of TB status disclo-
 sure as a result of using the technologies, unreliable networks, and lack of money.

<section> Medication adherence
 
<section> Primary analysis. The median adherence over the 6-month study period was 96.1%, (IQR
 
<section> 84.8–98.0), 92.5% (IQR 80.6–96.3), and 92.2% (IQR 56.3–97.8) respectively in the daily SMS,
 weekly SMS, and control arms and was similar, within study arm, over the two study phases.
 In the univariable analysis, average adherence was 8.4% (-5.8, 22.5; p = 0.24) higher in the
 daily SMS arm than the control arm while that in the weekly SMS arm was 4.7 (-10.3, 19.8;
 p = 0.53) higher than that in control arm. In the multivariable analysis controlling for gender,
 food security, HIV status social support and TB disclosure, participants in the daily SMS arm
 had 9.9% (95% CI -4.8, 24.5; p = 0.18) higher adherence than participants in the control arm,
 while those in the weekly SMS arm had 6.3% (95% CI -8.7, 21.3; p = 0.40) higher adherence
 than those in the control arm. The results were similar when considering the secondary data-
 set. In both the univariate and multivariate analyses, the higher adherence observed was not
 
<section> statistically significant as indicated by the P values. 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> Findings from this study show that real-time electronic monitoring and the use of SMS as
 reminders for TB patients and notifications for provision of social support were largely feasible
 and acceptable for TB medication adherence in southwestern Uganda. The pilot RCT revealed
 higher median adherence in the daily SMS and weekly SMS arms compared to the control,
 although the study was not powered for statistical significance when controlling for gender,
 food security, social support, stigma, and HIV status. These findings suggest preliminary evi-
 dence for clearly meaningful effect that should be considered for further evaluation in a fully
 powered larger trial.
 The use of real-time adherence monitoring linked to SMS reminders to TB patients was fea-
 sible for supporting TB medication adherence in southwestern Uganda. All TB patients per-
 ceived the technologies to be easy to use. Most SMS reminders were sent as planned,
 demonstrating feasibility of this technology. The real-time medication monitors generally
 worked well; most of the adherence data was transferred as expected. Although no other stud-
 ies have reported the feasibility of real-time adherence monitoring linked to SMS reminders
 for TB medication (studies such as the ASCENT trial, ClinicalTrials.gov number,
 NCT02574455 will be forthcoming), these technologies have been similarly reported to be fea-
 sible for monitoring ART adherence [17]. Despite the general feasibility of the technologies
 the current study, poor mobile networks, not using the technology appropriately, and lack of
 money for transport to the clinic could limit the impact of the intervention. Notably, cellphone
 network is rapidly expanding in Uganda [36], and there is widespread cellphone adoption
 including among TB patients [37], suggesting these technical challenges may improve with
 time. “With 2G networks reaching nearly the entire population in Uganda, and with mobile
 broadband networks (3G/4G) covering more than 80% of the country [38], poor network is
 not a significant challenge. Although reported by few participants, opening the monitor with-
 out taking medication or taking medication from other sources could limit the accuracy of
 adherence monitoring. Some of this bias can be accounted for in analysis (e.g. excluding more
 openings per day than would be expected).
 The use of social support notifications to social supporters was feasible—most notifications
 were sent as planned, and all social supporters reported assisting the participants (e.g. trans-
 port to the clinic, money for buying food and drinks, counseling) at least once after receiving
 SMS notifications. Social support (such as food supplements, and economic support) delivered
 through face-to-face approaches improved TB treatment completion in various settings
 including low resource settings such as Nepal, Burkina Faso, and Haiti [32]. However, the
 impact of SMS notifications could be constrained by the reported lack of financial resources
 support TB patients. Complementing the SMS notification intervention with interventions to
 boost the economic status [39] of social supporters (e.g. through income generating activities
 such as farming) may improve their capacity to provide the support needed by the patients.
 The use of real-time adherence monitoring linked to SMS reminders to TB patients and
 notifications to social supporters was acceptable for supporting TB medication adherence in
 this setting. All TB patients perceived the technologies to be useful in supporting TB medica-
 tion adherence. Receiving SMS reminders and being monitored reminded TB patients to take
 their medication on time, thus, addressing the challenge of forgetfulness. This function is espe-
 cially important for TB patients with busy schedules or those inexperienced with regular medi-
 cation. Additionally, receiving SMS and being monitored with a real-time monitor were
 perceived as being “cared for”. This perception can encourage TB patients to take medication
 in order to cooperate with those who gave them the intervention while at the same time
 taking care of their own lives. Notably, the use of these technologies to support ART 
<section> medication adherence was reported to be acceptable among people living with HIV in the
 same setting [17].
 Overall, our findings indicate that real-time adherence monitoring linked to SMS remind-
 ers to TB patients and notifications to social supporters is feasible and acceptable for support-
 ing TB drug administration. This is specifically critical in settings like Uganda where the
 implementation of DOT has been abandoned mainly due to the financial burden it places on
 the TB patients (in the form of transport to the clinic for drug administration), as well as time
 demands on healthcare workers (who have to physically watch TB patients take their medica-
 tion amidst other competing demands). This technology can keep TB patients connected with
 healthcare supporters, which can potentially minimize the challenge of social isolation that is
 often associated with TB.
 Our study found that SMS reminders may improve TB medication adherence. Compared to
 weekly or triggered SMS, TB patients found daily reminders matching well with their daily pill
 taking and perceived them as daily encouragements to take their medications. The prior study
 the same setting showed that daily SMS reminders integrated with real-time monitoring can
 improve ART adherence [18]. High quality studies utilizing SMS reminders (not linked to real-
 time adherence monitoring) to support TB medication report mixed results. A recent systematic
 review of 14 randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies done prior to 2019
 reported essentially no difference in TB treatment success (i.e. pooled estimate of 87% with SMS
 vs 85% in the control group) [40]. In another recent systematic review of 16 randomized con-
 trolled trials that utilized digital health technologies to support TB medication adherence, only
 of the 8 studies that utilized interactive SMS reminders and educational SMS texts reported posi-
 tive benefits of using this technology in reducing medication adherence defaults and increasing
 cure rate in China [41] and treatment adherence and cure rate in Argentina [42]. Compared to
 our SMS reminder system that was one-way, automatic and linked to a real-time technology, the
 study in Argentina was more interactive and had a common feature of providing a sense of regu-
 lar support. The remainder of the SMS reminder studies (not linked to a real-time technology)
 found no effect of SMS reminders on TB medication adherence compared to the standard of
 care in United States, Spain, Hong Kong, and South Africa [43–47]. British Columbia Canada
 [44], Sudan [45], Pakistan [48], and Cameroon [49]. In the same review, the use of real-time
 adherence monitors integrated with medication reminders resulted in fewer missed doses com-
 pared to real-time adherence monitors without reminders in China [19], while real-time adher-
 ence monitors without reminders reduced TB treatment defaults in Haiti [50]. The variable
 results among studies of SMS reminders highlight the importance of understanding how the
 technology is used and perceived. The causes of the differences in findings are unclear but might
 relate to context, culture, degree of technology exposure, TB patients involvement in technology
 development, fidelity of technology use, varying measures of adherence, access to social support,
 and other factors such as depression, and lack of transport to the clinic.
 The acceptability of the technologies can be limited by the possibility of unintended TB sta-
 tus disclosure (e.g., when someone sees the SMS or monitor) which might result into stigma
 and discrimination. Using messages that are not easily linked with TB as preferred in this
 study can reduce the possibility of SMS-enabled unintended status disclosure. It should how-
 ever be noted that technology-enabled disease status disclosure is not always unwanted; for
 instance, participants living with HIV in the same setting had previously reported using the
 monitor to intentionally disclose their HIV status mainly to enable them get social support
 [51]. For TB patients who would want to keep their status private, the monitor-led unwanted
 status disclosure could be minimized by redesigning it to better meet the needs of TB patients
 (e.g., making the monitor more portable and discreet). Additionally, interventions that reduce
 stigma can be incorporated. 
<section> In the current study, many social supporters reported improved relationship with TB
 patients as a result of using the SMS notifications. Social supporters might have felt more
 obliged to be there for TB patients after having been identified (by TB patients themselves) as
 their helpers (who should receive notifications), in order not to disappoint them. TB patients
 might have felt the need to meet the expectations (i.e., adherence) of social supporters to not
 undermine the support provided and to keep getting the support [52]. This finding is in con-
 trast to that reported in a related intervention for supporting ART adherence in the same set-
 ting, in which some conflicts arose as a result of mismatch of expectations between TB patients
 and their social supporters [25] and lack of clear benefits of social support [18]. Formative
 results from the current study highlighted the possibility of misunderstandings between social
 supporters and TB patients as a result of the frequent receipt of SMS notifications which may
 be perceived as lack of commitment to taking medication [53]. The possibility of such misun-
 derstandings was managed through orientation.
 This study has some limitations. From qualitative work, we found out the real-time mon-
 itor alone can motivate TB patients to take medication. Therefore, using the real-time mon-
 itor in the control arm could have had its own intervention effect, which might have
 affected the detection of intervention effects in other study arms. Although the use of the
 real-time adherence monitor may be more accurate than traditional approaches to adher-
 ence monitoring (such as self-report and clinic-based pill counts), its non-use (e.g., taking
 drugs from other sources during travel) and/or inappropriate use (e.g., opening it without
 taking medication) might have affected the accuracy of adherence estimations of a few TB
 patients across study arms. Also, for this pilot study, rather than intention to treat analysis,
 we used per protocol analysis that involved excluding TB patients who voluntarily withdrew
 from the study or declined to use the adherence monitor. Being a pilot study, the small sam-
 ple size involved limits results generalizability. Lastly, since participants self-reported their
 perceptions about the intervention, qualitative results (and some self-reported quantitative
 aspects) could be vulnerable to social desirability bias especially since participants knew
 that they were reporting on the intervention given to them by the same researchers collect-
 ing data from them.
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the use of real-time adher-
 ence monitoring linked to SMS reminders to TB patients and notifications to social supporters
 among TB patients. Real-time monitoring creates the potential for intervening prior to the
 development of treatment failure and/or drug resistance. Our multiple approaches to the use
 of SMS (i.e. daily, weekly, triggered) made it possible to identify TB patients’ preferences and
 highlight the usefulness of these approaches.
 In summary, we found that real-time adherence monitoring linked to daily SMS reminders
 and notifications followed by triggered SMS reminders and notification is generally feasible.
 SMS were sent and received as planned, and data from the monitor was transferred as
 expected, most of the time. The technology was acceptable and feasible in a resource limited
 setting. The intervention appeared to improve TB adherence, though the difference in study
 arms was not significant; importantly, this study was not powered for differences in medica-
 tion adherence. Larger studies are needed to determine the larger-scale feasibility, acceptabil-
 ity, and impact on TB treatment adherence and clinical outcomes. Integrating economic
 support to the intervention could empower social supporters to meet the financial needs of TB
 patients, which they would otherwise not be able to meet; such work is ongoing
 (NCT05656287). Future work should also analyze the cost of the technology to inform poten-
 tial scalability.
