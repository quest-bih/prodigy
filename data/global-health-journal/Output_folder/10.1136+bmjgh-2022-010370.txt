 VI and vaccine confidence for COVID-­19 vaccines.

<section> INTRODUCTION
 Regulatory approval of COVID-­ 19 vaccines
 in Japan lagged behind other countries.
 Starting in February 2021, COVID-­19 vaccines
 were initially administered to only healthcare
 workers ; then to older adults, those with
 chronic disease and those working for nursing
 facilities (around April 2021); and, finally,
 to the general population. Although the
 COVID-­19 vaccine coverage of the primary
 two-­dose series gradually increased to ~80%
 in 2022, vaccine uptake was lower in Japan
 than it was in other high-­income countries at
 the beginning of the vaccine rollout in 2021.
 For instance, the coverage rate in Japan was
 49% as of early August 2021, while other G7
 countries, such as Canada, the UK, France
 and Italy, all achieved over 65% coverage rate
 at that time.
 While the delay of regulatory approval and
 logistical issues influenced slow rollout, it
 was also rooted in public vaccine hesitancy.
 A previous study revealed that Japan was one
 of the least vaccine-­ confident countries in 
<section> WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 
<section> ⇒ Japan is one of the least vaccine-­confident countries in the world
 and has a long history of public uncertainties about vaccines in
 general.
 
<section> ⇒ Social media-­based interventions have been implemented to in-
 crease vaccine uptake; however, there have been conflicting data
 available on whether social media-­based interventions can in-
 crease vaccine intention and confidence.
 
<section> ⇒ There is a paucity of studies investigating the effect of a mobile app
 chatbot and interactive webinars on COVID-­19 vaccine intention
 and confidence in Japan.
 
<section> WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
 
<section> ⇒ This randomised controlled trial did not find sufficient evidence that
 the chatbot or the webinars changed COVID-­19 vaccine intention
 among those with high vaccine hesitancy and low acceptance in
 Japan in 2021 compared with control.
 
<section> ⇒ COVID-­19 vaccine confidence for importance, safety and effec-
 tiveness increased with the webinar intervention compared with
 control.
 
<section> ⇒ Vaccine confidence in importance and effectiveness of COVID-­19
 vaccines decreased in the control group over time.
 
<section> HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR
 
<section> POLICY
 
<section> ⇒ Interactive small-­scale webinars featuring live Q&A with medical
 professionals may serve as an efficacious method for addressing
 public concerns about COVID-­19 vaccines and enhancing vaccine
 confidence.
 
<section> ⇒ In light of the worsening vaccine confidence among unvaccinated
 individuals without any mitigation, local governments and public
 health organisations may necessitate conducting regular, interac-
 tive, small-­group webinars, particularly in regions with low vaccine
 uptake or high vaccine hesitancy.
 
<section> ⇒ Further research is needed to investigate the strategies for recruit-
 ing and retaining participation of individuals with vaccine hesitancy
 in randomised controlled trials and to assess the effects of social
 media-­based interventions on increasing vaccine intention and the
 vaccine confidence for COVID-­19 vaccines.
 
<section> the world, even before the COVID-­19 pandemic. 4 Japan
 has a long history of public uncertainties about vaccines,
 such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, which led to
 a severe drop in coverage, from over 70% to less than
 1% after the rise of public anxiety and the government’s
 suspension of proactive recommendation of the vaccine
 due to public pressure about suspected vaccine adverse
 events. 5 A survey conducted in 15 countries in January
 2021 found that intention to be vaccinated against
 COVID-­19 was lower in Japan than in other countries:
 36% of surveyed Japanese adults strongly or somewhat
 disagreed with being vaccinated against COVID-­ 6
 As success of vaccine rollout ultimately depends on the
 public’s willingness to be vaccinated, 8 increasing vaccine
 intention (VI) and vaccine confidence among those who
 are unwilling or hesitant to be vaccinated was a critical
 priority in 2021 to improve vaccine uptake in Japan.
 During the COVID-­19 pandemic, too much information
 and rumours, both accurate and false, have spread widely
 and rapidly through online platforms. 9 This ‘infodemic’
 confused people and created uncertainty about trust in
 the COVID-­19 vaccine. A past nationwide survey in Japan
 demonstrated that many study participants wanted to
 obtain more information on COVID-­19 vaccines to make
 a decision about being vaccinated, including information
 about the compatibilities between the vaccine and their
 personal health conditions, the effectiveness of vaccines
 and medical doctors’ recommendations. 7 To provide the
 non-­health expert public with scientific evidence-­based
 information on COVID-­ 19 vaccines in a user-­ friendly
 manner, it is important to explore the best platform(s)
 to optimise public understanding of COVID-­19 vaccine
 information and ultimately improve their VI and
 confidence.
 Past studies indicated the potential of online interven-
 tions to increase VI and uptake by providing accurate
 information on vaccines and disease and by increasing
 public perception of vaccine benefits. For example, a
 randomised controlled study in 2017 demonstrated
 that mothers presented with accurate vaccine informa-
 tion on social media during their pregnancy were more
 likely to vaccinate their infants on time. 10 A recent cross-­
 sectional study showed that small-­group Zoom webinars
 helped address misconceptions surrounding COVID-­19
 vaccines and was associated with increased willingness
 to be vaccinated among 91 Asian immigrants in Canada
 and the USA. 11 Virtual webinars were also reported
 to be effective in reducing vaccine hesitancy at black
 church congregations. 12 On the other hand, another
 study suggested that social media use itself may not be
 directly associated with people’s willingness to receive
 a COVID-­19 vaccination. 13 There have been conflicting
 data available about whether and how online or virtual
 webinars can be used to address COVID-­19 vaccine hesi-
 tancy. Furthermore, we previously published a cross-­
 sectional study investigating the association between
 COVID-­19 VI and the use of a chatbot in a popular
 messenger app in Japan. 14 Though this study indicated
 the potential usefulness of a social media-­based chatbot
 to reduce vaccine hesitancy, this study was subject to
 multiple limitations in terms of the study design since
 the study was cross-­sectional only among chatbot users
 without a comparison group. Therefore, it had both
 internal (eg, recall bias, interview bias) and external
 validity issues, and the association between chatbot use
 and VI could not be clearly evaluated.
 To address this knowledge gap, we investigated
 whether social media-­based interventions could increase
 COVID-­ 19 VI and vaccine confidence among those
 with vaccine hesitancy. We used two different online
 interventions, a social media-­ based chatbot and webi-
 nars, and examined which of these were more effective
 at increasing COVID-­19 VI and vaccine confidence. By
 conducting two online interventions, we examined how
 different online tools can be used depending on people’s
 demands and available resources. 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Study design and setting
 We conducted a three-­ arm randomised controlled trial
 to investigate the impact of a mobile app chatbot and an
 online interactive seminar (webinar) on COVID-­19 VI and
 vaccine confidence among those (1) unvaccinated and
 unwilling or hesitant to be vaccinated; and (2) aged
 or older in Japan from 5 November 2021 until 9 January
 2022. We assessed COVID-­19 VI and vaccine confidence
 by performing preintervention and postintervention cross-­
 sectional surveys.
 During the study period, three COVID-­ 19 vaccines
 were publicly available: BNT162b2, mRNA-­ 1273 and
 ChAdOx1-­S/nCoV-­19. The costs of vaccines were covered
 in full by public funds for all Japanese nationals and all
 eligible foreign residents. The government has strongly
 recommended that all people get vaccinated given the
 global evidence shows that the benefits of vaccination
 are greater than the risk of adverse event. Thanks to the
 government’s recommendations, about 80% of Japanese
 people had received at least one dose of a COVID-­19
 vaccine when this study was conducted. 15 Third dose of
 COVID-­19 vaccines was only available to limited health-
 care workers during the present study. No new vaccines
 became available and no new policy was implemented
 during the study period of 2.5 months. The period when
 the postsurvey was conducted (between late December
 2021 and early January 2022) covered the two key phases
 that influenced public perceptions on vaccines: (1)
 when the daily reported COVID-­19 cases were relatively
 low with less than 1000 cases per day; and (2) when the
 Omicron variant emerged.
 
<section> Study participants
 Study participants were recruited from the panel of a Japa-
 nese internet research service company (NTTCom Online
 Marketing Solutions), which had approximately 120 million
 registered individuals as of October 2021. First, the screening
 survey was sent to 700 000 randomly selected persons in the
 panel on 20 October 2021 with the following five questions:
 (1) ‘How old are you?’; (2) ‘Have you received a COVID-­19
 vaccine?’; (3) ‘Do you intend to be vaccinated?’ (with answer
 options of ‘Yes’, ‘Not sure but toward Yes’, ‘Not sure but
 toward No’ and ‘No’); (4) ‘Do you have LINE (one of the
 most popular messenger apps in Japan) installed on your
 mobile phone? If not, are you willing to download LINE to
 participate in this study?’; and (5) ‘Are you capable of using
 
<section> Zoom for webinars?’ Eligibility criteria included: (1) age
 or older; (2) had never received a COVID-­19 vaccine; (3)
 those who selected an answer other than ‘Yes’ to question 3;
 (4) willing to use LINE; and (5) willing to use Zoom. Mone-
 tary incentives were given as follows: 1000 yen (~US$8) for
 those who completed the presurvey and postsurvey in the
 control group, 1500 yen for those who used the chatbot at
 least once and completed the presurvey and postsurvey and
 3000 yen for those who attended at least one of 14 webinars
 for at least 15 min and completed presurveys and postsur-
 veys.
 
<section> Preintervention survey
 Eligible persons were invited to participate in the
 presurvey by email on 5 November 2021. Questionnaires
 were placed in a secure section of a website, and persons
 who consented electronically received the link to the
 questionnaires. The presurvey ended on 10 November
 2021 (a total of 5 days). The presurvey had a total of
 30 questions (online supplemental text S2), including
 survey items used in similar studies, 16 as well as our own
 questions. The survey also asked for age, sex, geographic
 location, educational attainment, employment status,
 work in a healthcare setting, annual household income,
 presence of chronic diseases identified as risk factors for
 severe COVID-­19 by the Japanese government, 17 history
 of influenza vaccine in the previous season, history of
 COVID-­19 infection, history of any side effect from any
 previous vaccination and COVID-­ 19 VI for their chil-
 dren, if any. Geographic locations were combined using
 the following categories: Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto (eg,
 Tokyo), Chubu, Kansai (eg, Osaka), Kinki, Chugoku,
 Shikoku, Kyushu regions and outside of Japan. 18 In addi-
 tion, questions were asked about personal experience
 with social media involving COVID-­19 vaccine informa-
 tion. These questions included which social network the
 participants use most to obtain COVID-­19 vaccine infor-
 mation, which social media they trust most and how long
 they use social media per day, among others.
 
<section> Intervention with LINE chatbot (chatbot group)
 Persons who answered the presurvey between 5 and 10
 November 2021 were randomly assigned to one of the
 following three groups: (1) no exposure to the LINE
 chatbot nor webinar (control group); (2) the mobile app
 chatbot users (chatbot group); and (3) online interactive
 seminar users (webinar group). Randomisation into three
 groups was conducted between 11 and 14 November 2021
 by biostatisticians (EHYL and JW). Instructions for each
 intervention were sent on 15 November 2021 to all three
 groups. The chatbot was accessible on 15 November and
 webinars started on 16 November 2021.
 LINE is a free messenger app available on electronic
 devices, such as smartphones, tablets and personal
 computers. LINE users can exchange texts, images, video
 and audio. LINE is the most popular messenger app in
 
<section> Japan: about 86 million people in Japan (roughly two-­
 thirds of the population) use this messenger app. 19 We
 created a chatbot in LINE to answer COVID-­19 vaccine
 frequently asked questions (FAQs) via text messages
 (online supplemental figure S1). 14 This chatbot has
 approximately 200 sets of questions and answers. Our
 chatbot works as follows: (1) users tap to select the item
 that they want to ask from a menu of options; the menu
 options are well organised with clearly labelled sections,
 such as ‘How do COVID-­19 vaccines work?’, ‘What are the
 possible side effects of the vaccine?’ and ‘What is the eligibility
 for vaccination?’; (2) the chatbot automatically lists more
 specific questions relevant to the item that users choose
 in step 1; (3) users further choose a specific question that 
<section> they want to ask from the list; and (4) the chatbot auto-
 matically provides detailed information and answers to a
 chosen question. Users can also search questions via free
 text keywords and the chatbot shows potential questions
 that include the entered keywords. With these phased
 steps, users can access information that they seek very
 quickly without consuming a vast amount of time to find
 specific information from internet search engines.
 The first email was sent on 15 November 2021 to study
 participants assigned to the chatbot group to explain how
 to use the chatbot and to provide them with a link through
 which they can access the chatbot; they also received a link to
 a 5 min YouTube video (https://youtu.be/nJBTHaXapQ8).
 One reminder was sent to participants who did not access
 the chatbot on 24 November 2021. The participants could
 access the chatbot until the end of the study period. In
 addition, we tracked who downloaded the chatbot and how
 frequently each FAQ was accessed in the chatbot during the
 study period to determine which participants were included
 for final analysis.
 
<section> Intervention with interactive webinars
 We conducted a total of 14 webinars via Zoom between
 November and 7 December 2021. Each seminar was held
 on Tuesdays and Fridays at 10:00 and 20:00 hours to allow
 study participants to choose suitable dates and times. We
 asked participants in the webinar group to attend at least
 one webinar for 30 min. They were allowed to participate
 in more than one webinar if they preferred. They were
 required to choose their preferred date and time for the
 webinar and to register in advance through a temporary
 website with links to the 14 different webinar sessions.
 Each webinar was limited to a maximum of 40 partici-
 pants to allow greater interactivity between health experts
 and participants. Reminder emails were sent to regis-
 trants 24 hours and 1 hour before each webinar using an
 automated reminder system in Zoom. We sent an email
 to the webinar group participants (n=386) a total of four
 times (initial instruction email and three reminders)
 to encourage them to register for at least one of the
 seminars. Each webinar included a brief lecture about
 the COVID-­19 vaccine (10 min) presented by physicians
 using PowerPoint slides, followed by Q&A sessions (addi-
 tional 20–50 min). We tracked who registered and partic-
 ipated in each webinar. Those who stayed on a webinar
 less than 15 min (of 30 min) were not considered to
 have attended the webinar and were not included in the
 final analysis (n=1). The lecture included the history of
 vaccines, the necessity and the efficacy of the COVID-­19
 vaccine and the possible risks of short-­term and long-­
 term adverse events with the COVID-­19 vaccine. Partic-
 ipants were encouraged to ask questions throughout a
 webinar through the Zoom Q&A chat feature, and ques-
 tions from participants were collected before and during
 the webinar. Attendees could submit questions anony-
 mously if they chose. Three of seven Japanese physicians
 (TK, YY, HT, KH, YN, KT, HM and KI) were required to
 attend each webinar as presenters, and the webinars were
 conducted in the Japanese language only. Each webinar
 included three physicians, one moderator and one office
 administrator, and all questions submitted on registra-
 tions through Zoom and during webinars were answered
 by physicians during the webinars.
 
<section> Postintervention survey
 We created three different postsurveys specific to each of
 the assigned groups. All three groups were asked about
 their history of COVID-­19 vaccination since the presurvey,
 and their current VI and vaccine confidence for safety,
 importance and effectiveness. The postsurvey was sent to
 the chatbot and webinar groups (online supplemental
 text S3) between 22 December 2021 and 9 January 2022.
 
<section> Sample size calculation
 A previous study in France investigating the impact of an
 interactive web tool on patients with COVID-­19 vaccine
 hesitancy showed that 8% of 1200 patients accepted
 COVID-­ 19 vaccination after their intervention. 20 We
 assumed that the estimated proportion of VI in the inter-
 vention group after intervention would be 10% and that
 the proportion of VI in the control group would remain
 zero. For achieving an 80% power at 5% level of signifi-
 cance with equal allocation, a dropout rate of 40% and a
 superiority margin of 5%, the calculated sample size for
 each arm was 371 participants.
 
<section> Outcome data and statistical analysis
 The primary analysis was based on the intention-­to-­treat
 (ITT) principle. Participant characteristics were summa-
 rised using frequencies and percentages. For two-­group
 comparisons, the χ 2 test or Fisher’s exact test was used for
 categorical variables and the Mann-­Whitney U test was
 used for continuous variables. For three-­group compari-
 sons, the χ 2 test was used for categorical variables.
 Primary outcomes were VI and vaccine confidence.
 VI was measured by the proportion of those who had
 received a COVID-­19 vaccine since the presurvey, and
 those who had not but who answered ‘Yes, definitely’
 in the postsurvey to the question ‘Do you intend to be
 vaccinated against COVID-­19?’. Vaccine confidence was
 quantified using the Vaccine Confidence Index (VCI).
 A previous study demonstrated that, among a multiplicity
 of factors influencing vaccine decisions, key drivers of
 public confidence in vaccines were identified as trust
 in the importance, safety and effectiveness of vaccines,
 along with compatibility of vaccination with religious
 beliefs. 21 A vaccine confidence survey tool was devel-
 oped in 2015 and has been used in multiple different
 types of vaccine studies. 22 The VCI includes four vaccine
 confidence statements: ‘Overall I think vaccines are
 important’; ‘Overall I think vaccines are safe’; ‘Overall
 I think vaccines are effective’; and ‘Vaccines are compat-
 ible with my religious beliefs’. We decided not to use the
 statement about religious beliefs in our study because this
 statement does not fit well with Japanese customs since
 more than 80% of people in Japan have no religion. 23 We

<iend>

 present for each intervention group the proportions of
 participants having improvement in vaccine confidence,
 defined by those who responded ‘do not know’, ‘tend to
 disagree’ and ‘strongly disagree’ before intervention and
 responded ‘strongly agree’ or ‘tend to agree’.
 Differences in the proportion (postintervention
 compared with preintervention) of VI and VCI across
 arms were compared by fitting a logistic regression model
 on the postintervention VI (participants who responded
 ‘Yes, definitely’) and the postintervention VCI (partici-
 pants who responded ‘strongly agree’ or ‘tend to agree’
 to these specific questions on vaccine confidence). The
 baseline VI, VCI and intervention group were used as
 predictor. Missing outcomes were imputed using multi-
 variate imputation by chained equations with 50 impu-
 tations, based on baseline characteristics including
 demographics, health conditions, vaccine confidence
 and intervention group assignment. We obtained the
 final estimates by pooling the estimates from 50 imputed
 data sets using Rubin’s rules. We used R V.4.0.4 (R Devel-
 opment Core Team, Vienna) for statistical analysis. A p
 value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
 
<section> Patient and public involvement
 Patients were not involved in designing the study, deter-
 mining the research questions, deciding the outcomes
 measured, recruiting participants or conducting the
 study. The burden of the intervention was not assessed;
 however, study participants’ feedback about the chatbot
 and the webinars was obtained in the postsurvey. All
 relevant data will be shared on our website (https://​
 corowakun-supporters.studio.site/#news). Patient advi-
 sors were not involved with this study.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> A total of 99 965 persons responded to the screening
 questions between 5 November and 10 November 2021.
 Of these, 15 398 (15.4%) had not received a vaccine yet,
 of which 13 314 (86.5%) did not intend to be vaccinated.
 Among 13 314 eligible persons, 1158 agreed to participate
 in the study, completed the presurvey and were randomly
 assigned to one of the three different groups: control
 group (n=386), chatbot group (n=386) and webinar group
 (n=386) (figure 1). In the control group, 359/386 (93.0%)
 answered the postsurvey. In the chatbot group, 237/386
 (61.4%) accessed the chatbot at least once, of which
 (97.5%) answered the postsurvey. In the webinar group,
 215/386 (55.7%) attended a webinar at least once, of
 which 207 (96.3%) answered the postsurvey. The average
 duration between the intervention and the postsurvey was
 32 days in chatbot group and 27 days in webinar group.
 All 1158 participants were included for the final analysis
 under ITT principle. Baseline characteristics and demo-
 graphics of participants were balanced across the three
 groups for most variables (table 1 for selected variables
 and online supplemental table S1 for all variables).
 
<section> VI and VCI
 
<section> VI was 0% for all three groups at the baseline according
 to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among the control
 group, VI increased to 18.5% (95% CI 14.5%, 22.5%)
 (table 2). Vaccine confidence decreased by 2.5% (95%
 CI −4.3%, 9.4%) for importance of vaccines and by 7.6%
 (95% CI 0.7%, 14.4%) for effectiveness naturally without
 any intervention, while it increased by 1.9% (95% CI
 −2.4%, 6.2%) for safety.

 In the chatbot group, VI increased to 15.4% (95% CI
 10.8%, 20.1%). Vaccine confidence increased by 3.3%
 (95% CI −4.0%, 10.7%) for importance and 2.5% (95%
 CI −2.3%, 7.4%) for safety, and it decreased by 2.4%
 (95% CI −5.2%, 9.9%) for effectiveness. There was no
 statistically significant difference in VI in the postsurvey
 between the chatbot and control groups (15.4% in the
 chatbot group and 18.5% in the control group, OR of
 improvement=0.8 (95% CI 0.5, 1.3), p=0.330, table 2).
 Vaccine confidence tended to be higher in the chatbot
 compared with the control group but there was no
 significant difference in importance (3.3% vs −2.5%, OR
 of =1.3 (95% CI 0.9, 2.0), p=0.177), safety (2.5% vs 1.9%,
 OR=1.1 (95% CI 0.7, 1.9), p=0.622) or effectiveness
 (−2.4% vs −7.6%, OR=1.4 (95% CI 0.9, 2.1), p=0.093).
 In the webinar group, VI increased to 19.7% (95% CI
 14.5%, 24.9%). Vaccine confidence increased by 7.8%
 (95% CI 0.3%, 15.4%) for importance, 6.0% (95% CI
 0.6%, 11.4%) for safety and 6.4% (95% CI −1.4%, 14.3%)

<section> (95% CI 0.7, 1.6), p=0.730, table 2). Vaccine confidence
 for importance and effectiveness significantly increased
 in the webinar group compared with the control group
 (7.8% vs −2.5%, OR=1.8 (95% CI 1.2, 2.8), p=0.004 and
 6.4% vs −7.6%, OR=2.2 (95% CI 1.4, 3.4), p<0.001).
 Vaccine confidence for safety increased in the webinar
 group; however, the difference was not statistically signif-
 icant (6.0% vs 1.9%, OR=1.6 (95% CI 1.0, 2.6), p=0.077).
 The full logistic model results were shown in online
 supplemental table S2.
 
<section> Feedback for the chatbot and the webinar
 Figure 2 presents feedback obtained from the postsurvey
 for the chatbot and webinar groups. Overall, a favour-
 able response was more frequently seen in the webinar
 group compared with the chatbot group for most ques-
 tions. The proportion of those who strongly agreed that
 the intervention was informative was 6.5% in the chatbot
 group and 20.3% in the webinar group (p<0.001). The
 proportion of those who strongly agreed that they intend
 to recommend the intervention to others was 3.5%
 in the chatbot group and 12.1% in the webinar group
 (p=0.001). The proportion of those who strongly agreed
 to use the intervention again was 6.5% in the chatbot
 group and 25.1% in the webinar group (p<0.001).
 
<section> Comparison within the chatbot group
 The association between the number of chatbot accesses
 and VI and VCI is summarised in online supplemental
 table S3. The median number of chatbot accesses was
 15 in those willing to be vaccinated in the postsurvey
 compared with 9 in those who remained vaccine hesitant
 (p<0.001). The number of chatbot accesses was not asso-
 ciated with vaccine confidence.
 
<section> Comparison within the webinar group
 The association between webinar attendance and VI and
 VCI within the webinar group is summarised in online
 supplemental table S4. The duration of webinar attend-
 ance in minutes was not associated with either VI or VCI.
 The number of attended webinar sessions was not associ-
 ated with either VI or vaccine confidence.
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> We did not find sufficient evidence that the chatbot
 or the webinar changed COVID-­ 19 VI among those
 with vaccine hesitancy in Japan in 2021 compared with
 control. However, vaccine confidence for importance,
 safety and effectiveness increased with the webinar inter-
 vention compared with control. A small-­group interactive
 webinar might be an effective tool for changing vaccine
 hesitancy. However, given there was no increase in VI
 despite improved confidence in importance and effec-
 tiveness, confidence index alone might not correlate well
 with COVID-­19 VI in Japan. Further research is needed
 to investigate how to recruit and retain those with vaccine
 hesitancy in randomised controlled trials and whether
 social media-­based interventions can increase VI and VCI
 for COVID-­19 vaccines.
 In this study, 15%–20% of participants with vaccine
 hesitancy, in either the control or intervention group,
 changed their minds and were accepting of the COVID-­19
 vaccine by the end of the study period. Social norms and
 awareness of COVID-­19 vaccine status of persons close
 to those with vaccine hesitancy are important factors in
 Japan, 24 25 and the already high vaccine uptake at the
 beginning of the study period (at ~80%) might have
 helped change vaccine hesitancy over time regardless
 of whether VCI decreased or increased. Additionally,
 according to a global systematic review on the determi-
 nants of vaccine hesitancy, perceived vaccine safety was
 one of the most frequently cited factors in past studies.
 Previous nationwide surveys in Japan also suggested that
 concerns about side effects and the safety of COVID-­19
 vaccines could be influential reasons for vaccine unwill-
 ingness or hesitancy. 7 27 Therefore, we speculate one
 potential reason why VI did not significantly increase with
 the webinar intervention despite the increase in vaccine
 confidence might be due to the lack of significant change
 in confidence for safety compared with control.
 We calculated the proportion of those willing to be
 vaccinated after intervention, stratified by groups with
 and without improvement in the three dimensions
 of vaccine confidence and intervention arms (online
 supplemental table S5) to see the association between 
<section> VI and vaccine confidence after interventions. However,
 we observed different patterns of VI across three arms,
 which indicates that interventions may have modified the
 relationship between VI and confidence. The Working
 Group on Vaccine Hesitancy established by the Stra-
 tegic Advisory Group of Experts of WHO indicated that
 vaccine hesitancy is the behaviour that reflects a constel-
 lation of factors that may influence the vaccination
 decision-­making. 28 This group highlighted 3Cs including
 complacency, convenience and confidence as a model of
 vaccine hesitancy. The fact that our intervention might
 have affected the factors above differently and we only
 focused on confidence factor in the postsurvey may
 explain why we observed a different pattern in the associ-
 ation between COVID-­19 VI and confidence across three
 arms. We need to explore how different social media-­
 based interventions change various factors (ie, 3Cs) that
 affect VI, so we can understand the most appropriate
 intervention for each factor.
 Our previous cross-­ sectional study indicated that a
 free chatbot had the possibility to decrease vaccine
 hesitancy ; however, this randomised controlled trial
 demonstrated that the chatbot did not change VI nor
 vaccine confidence. We hypothesise that the chatbot
 might have been more effective early in the pandemic
 when accurate, specific and sought-­after information was
 not readily and widely available to the public. This may
 be because vaccine hesitancy is due to lack of scientific
 information and is about underlying emotions behind
 vaccine decision-­making. 29 Changing people’s percep-
 tions of vaccines requires more interaction between the
 public and the medical community to understand the
 emotions involved in vaccine hesitancy and confidence.
 Thus, the webinar offered a platform where a health
 expert addressed an individual’s vaccine concerns and
 negative emotions by talking with them directly. In fact,
 our interactive webinar significantly increased vaccine
 confidence for importance and effectiveness. Feed-
 back from participants showed a significantly favour-
 able response in the webinar group compared with the
 chatbot group. Live questions asked by webinar partici-
 pants covered topics like the safety of COVID-­19 vaccines,
 vaccine effectiveness of the three available vaccines, the
 influence of new variants and common myths, among
 others. Nevertheless, there have been conflicting data
 available on whether educational interventions reduce
 vaccine hesitancy. 31–33 Our study limited the number of
 participants in webinars to 40, and questions were asked
 anonymously. Providing a small, interactive and possibly
 anonymous webinar where individuals can discuss their
 concerns directly with professionals might be an effective
 strategy for increasing vaccine confidence, which could
 in turn decrease vaccine hesitancy.
 Confidence in the importance and effectiveness of
 COVID-­19 vaccines decreased in the control group over
 time. This means that those who remain vaccine hesitant
 may be even more hesitant about COVID-­19 vaccines than
 before. The period when the postsurvey was conducted
 covered two key phases that possibly influenced the
 participants’ perceptions on vaccines. During the first
 phase, the daily reported COVID-­19 cases in Japan were
 relatively low, which might have affected ‘importance’
 in vaccine confidence. The second phase was the emer-
 gence of the Omicron variant in other countries despite
 available vaccines, which might have affected ‘effective-
 ness’ in vaccine confidence. Also, the fact that individ-
 uals, including those who are vaccinated, are still at risk
 for COVID-­19 infection even in the third year of the
 pandemic might have caused tiredness, frustration and
 anxiety, possibly contributing to this worsening VCI in
 the control group.
 This study has several limitations. First, since the study
 was conducted entirely online, actual vaccine uptake
 after the intervention could not be investigated. Second,
 we could not evaluate the effect of in-­person seminars.
 Although some people prefer online seminars with anon-
 ymous participation—especially in Japanese culture
 contexts—in-­person seminars may have more potential,
 including more direct, open and honest communica-
 tion than occurs online. In addition, in-­person seminars
 can provide COVID-­ 19 vaccines on-­ site immediately
 following the seminars for those who become agreeable.
 Third, even with a monetary incentive, the participation
 rate was not as high as we expected. To reduce attrition
 bias, we used multivariate imputation to predict outcome
 variables of non-­respondents. The ITT and per-­protocol
 analyses gave broadly similar outcomes (table 2 and
 online supplemental table S6), and all numbers were
 within the 95% CIs indicating statistically insignificant
 differences. Additionally, we compared the participants’
 characteristic between those who completed assigned
 interventions and those who did not (online supple-
 mental table S7). However, we could not identify a clear
 difference between the two groups. Fourth, though our
 study confirmed that an interactive webinar might have
 a role in increasing vaccine confidence, our research
 cannot determine the most effective method to recruit
 those who have not received and do not intend to receive
 a COVID-­19 vaccine in a real-­world setting without any
 incentive. Fifth, those who did not have internet access
 were unable to participate in our study. Given that digital
 technologies are now considered a new determinant of
 health, we need to discuss the best way to recruit those
 with vaccine hesitancy who do not have internet access.
 Sixth, racial differences were not evaluated because all
 participants were Japanese. Seventh, this study used
 three professionals, one moderator and one administra-
 tive person for each webinar, and scheduling webinars
 with medical professionals and administrative persons on
 a regular basis might not be feasible without providing
 incentives to presenters, likely requiring support from
 local communities or external funding.
 In conclusion, neither the chatbot nor the webinar
 improved VI among those with vaccine unwillingness and
 hesitancy in Japan in 2021 compared with control. Small
 interactive webinars that include live Q&A sessions with 
<section> medical experts have the potential to effectively address
 public concerns regarding COVID-­ 19 vaccines and to
 improve vaccine confidence. Future research needs to
 focus on the relationship between vaccine confidence
 and COVID-­19 VI in Japan. Given the worsening vaccine
 confidence among those unvaccinated without interven-
 tion, local government and public health agencies may
 need to organise regular, small interactive webinars, espe-
 cially in areas with low vaccine uptake or high vaccine
 hesitancy. More prospective studies are needed to eval-
 uate the effect of on-­site interactive seminars with the
 capability of administering vaccines during or after the
 seminar to those who change their COVID-­19 VI.
