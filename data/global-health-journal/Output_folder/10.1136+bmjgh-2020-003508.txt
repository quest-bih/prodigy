<section> ABSTRACT
 
<section> Introduction Families living in extreme poverty require
 interventions to support early-­childhood development
 (ECD) due to broad risks. This longitudinal cluster
 randomised trial examines the effectiveness of Sugira
 Muryango (SM), a home-­visiting intervention linked to
 Rwanda’s social protection system to promote ECD and
 reduce violence compared with usual care (UC).
 
<section> Methods Families with children aged 6–36 months
 were recruited in 284 geographical clusters across three
 districts. Cluster-­level randomisation (allocated 1:1 SM:UC)
 was used to prevent diffusion. SM was hypothesised to
 improve child development, reduce violence and increase
 father engagement. Developmental outcomes were
 assessed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-
 3) and the Malawi Development Assessment Tool (MDAT)
 and anthropometric assessments of growth. Violence was
 assessed using questions from UNICEF Multiple Indicators
 Cluster Survey (MICS) and Rwanda Demographic and
 Health Surveys (DHS). Father engagement was assessed
 using the Home Observation for Measurement of the
 Environment. Blinded enumerators conducted interviews
 and developmental assessments.
 
<section> Results A total of 541 SM families and 508 UC families
 were enrolled and included in the analyses. Study attrition
 (2.0% children; 9.6% caregivers) was addressed by
 hot deck imputation. Children in SM families improved
 more on gross motor (d=0.162, 95% CI 0.065 to 0.260),
 communication (d=0.081, 95% CI 0.005 to 0.156),
 problem solving (d=0.101, 95% CI 0.002 to 0.179) and
 personal-­social development (d=0.096, 95% CI −0.015
 to 0.177) on the ASQ-3. SM families showed increased
 father engagement (OR=1.592, 95% CI 1.069 to
 2.368), decreased harsh discipline (incidence rate ratio,
 IRR=0.741, 95% CI 0.657 to 0.835) and intimate partner
 violence (IRR=0.616, 95% CI:0.458 to 0.828). There were
 no intervention-­related improvements on MDAT or child
 growth.

 means to deliver ECD intervention.

<section> INTRODUCTION
 Families living in extreme poverty require
 attention to risks to healthy child devel-
 opment, such as low stimulation, poor
 hygiene and nutrition, violence and neglect.
 Violence is a major factor affecting healthy
 development, but family violence is rarely
 addressed in early-­ childhood development
 (ECD)-­focused interventions. 1 Moreover,
 the typical focus of ECD interventions is on 
<section> mothers, 2 limiting the ability to work with the full home
 environment, including male caregivers. Despite an
 increasing call to move beyond focusing on mothers in
 initiatives to promote caregivers’ capabilities to provide
 enriched environments for children, 3 few interven-
 tion studies have focused on integrating promotion of
 father engagement 2 and family violence prevention
 into programmes that focus on common ECD elements
 such as nutrition, early learning and nurturing care.
 ECD interventions are broadly defined as program-
 matic efforts aimed at supporting healthy child devel-
 opment across domains of growth, developmental mile-
 stones, cognition, language and socioemotional devel-
 opment. Violence prevention may include education
 on harmful effects of direct and observed violence on
 children, and introduction of nonviolent strategies for
 resolving parental disputes and disciplining children.
 Previous home-­visiting interventions conducted in low
 and middle-­ income countries demonstrate the value
 of integrated approaches that link parenting interven-
 tions to other ECD-­ promoting programmes including
 economic strengthening programmes such as cash
 transfer programmes, 5 6 nutritional interventions, 7–9
 primary healthcare 10 and maternal mental health inter-
 ventions. 11 However, evidence regarding interventions
 that combine a focus on improving ECD outcomes and
 reducing violence against children is sparse or of low
 quality. A 2018 systematic review identified six studies
 up to 2014. 12 Only two of these studies involved rando-
 misation, and both the randomised trial (n=45) and the
 cluster randomised trial (CRT) (n of clusters=5) lacked
 sufficient numbers for randomisation to assure balance
 across treatment and control conditions. We located an
 additional five studies from January 2015 to May 2020
 that featured both ECD and child violence outcomes. 13–17
 Among these recent studies, the rigour of the study design
 varied considerably. Two trials were randomised, but had
 insufficient enrolment to assume balance through rando-
 misation alone, and no stratification or matching was
 employed. 13 14 More specifically, one small randomised
 controlled trial of the Triple P-­positive parenting inter-
 vention in Indonesia observed significant improvements
 in parenting practices, parental stress and child behav-
 ioural problems but did not examine developmental
 milestones. 13 A randomised trial from Liberia found that
 a parenting intervention successfully reduced harsh disci-
 pline and improved caregiver–child interactions, but did
 not observe any improvements in child health or devel-
 opment. 14 Two studies used a cluster randomised design,
 each with 24 clusters. One of these was a home-­visiting
 programme enrolling pregnant women in South Africa,
 and used matching at the cluster level. This study found
 that the intervention had a significant effect on child
 health, growth and language, but did not find significant
 intervention effects on violence in the home. 15 The other
 CRT, which was set in Jamaica, was a preschool-­based
 programme that did not use matching and found positive
 intervention effects on teacher and child behaviours, but
 did not examine outcomes related to children’s devel-
 opmental milestones. 16 Finally, a quasi-­ experimental
 study using matching of counties across two provinces
 in China found positive effects of a parenting interven-
 tion that integrated components from the nurturing
 care framework with violence prevention on suspected
 developmental delay, and found that these effects were
 partially accounted for by improvements in positive disci-
 pline, cognitive stimulation and child growth. 17 Looking
 at the previous literature, evidence from even the more
 rigorous trails has been somewhat mixed. For example,
 two studies including the CRT from South Africa had
 significant findings in only one area (ie, ECD or violence
 reduction). 14
 Programmes targeting ECD and violence reduction have
 yet to be evaluated through rigorous, large-­scale studies
 employing randomised designs to add to the evidence of
 impact on child outcomes. Government social protection
 programmes present a potentially innovative platform
 for integrating home-­visiting interventions to promote
 ECD interventions, improving nurturing care, health and
 nutrition, and reducing violence, thus providing a vehicle
 for targeting poor and vulnerable populations, and
 combining income support with a focus on behaviours
 and investments in human capital. 5 The Rwandan
 government established a social protection programme
 called the ‘Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme’ in 2007
 to address poverty and human-­capital related disparities
 by offering direct support to poor families with young
 children and public works-­ based support. 18 Moreover,
 in 2017, the government established the National Early
 Childhood Development Programme to coordinate and
 expand an array of ECD initiatives, including ECD centres
 and home-­visiting interventions for the most vulnerable
 families. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of the
 Sugira Muryango (SM) (Strengthen the Family) interven-
 tion, a relatively brief (12 sessions delivered weekly over
 3 months) comprehensive home-­ visiting intervention
 for families with young children to promote ECD and
 reduce family violence as implemented by community-­
 based coaches and delivered in combination with Rwan-
 da’s social protection programme compared with those
 receiving usual care (UC) and social protection. We
 have previously reported intervention effects on care-
 giver behaviours immediately postintervention. 19 This
 paper reports on results from a 12-­month follow-­up. In
 line with our theory of change (figure 1), we hypothesise
 that participation in SM will be associated with improved
 child development outcomes 1 year after the intervention
 ended because previously reported changes in caregiver
 behaviours have succeed in building a healthy, stimu-
 lating and safe environment that supports children’s
 achievement of developmental milestones. Primary
 outcomes examined at 12-­month follow-­up are therefore
 children’s developmental milestones, father engagement
 in childcare and violence reduction (harsh discipline,
 maternal victimisation to intimate partner violence and
 paternal perpetration of violence). Given the emphasis

<iend>

 on father engagement and violence reduction, we also
 hypothesise that such effects will be sustained 1 year after
 the intervention ended. Measures related to child growth
 were included as primary outcomes in the clinical trial
 registration, but later redefined as secondary outcomes in
 the study protocol in recognition that even programmes
 that focus on and provide nutritional supplementation
 struggle to achieve improvements on child growth.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> We used a stratified CRT design to test SM’s effect on
 children’s motor, cognitive, language and social develop-
 ment, and physical growth, as well as family-­level violence
 and father engagement in care among families enrolled
 in the social protection programme. The use of a CRT
 over simple randomised assignment of families was to
 reduce the threat of diffusion of elements of SM within
 the setting of Rwandan villages. The CRT was conducted
 within three Rwandan districts selected based on the
 presence of the social protection programme and paying
 attention to other on-­ going interventions in order to
 minimise overlap with other large-­scale ECD interven-
 tions that could bias results. The study protocol can be
 found with the clinical trials registration cited above.
 Both coaches and enumerators were blind to the family’s
 intervention status at the time of baseline assessments.
 Enumerators were also not informed about the family’s
 assignment status during the two post-­intervention assess-
 ments.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> Families were eligible for inclusion in the study if they:
 (1) were eligible for either the classic public works, which
 from Betancourt et al -https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
 
<section> provided cash for intensive manual labour, or the newer
 expanded public works, which provided cash for more
 flexible, less strenuous work and thus all belonged to
 the most extreme level of poverty in the government’s
 household-­ranking system, Ubudehe 1; (2) had one or
 more child(ren) aged 6–36 months and (3) were willing
 to engage in a home-­visiting intervention. The age range
 of 6–36 months was defined to supplement existing ECD
 service for children in Rwanda, which are most widely
 available for children aged 5 years and older. Exclusion
 criteria for caregivers were a severe crisis such as psychosis
 or suicide attempts or severe cognitive impairment which
 would prevent the caregiver from responding to the inter-
 views. All adult caregivers gave written informed consent
 for themselves and their eligible children. The primary
 caregiver was defined as the caregiver who self-­identified
 as knowing the child best, most often the mother.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 Families were enrolled between 9 February 2018 and 27
 April 2018 (see figure 2 for timeline). Government staff
 in Nyanza, Ngoma and Rubavu districts provided lists of
 households that were eligible for the government’s public
 works programme. Geographically defined clusters were
 created as non-­overlapping and comprising at least
 families identified as eligible for the classic public works
 programme or at least ten families identified as eligible
 for the newer expanded public works programme, with
 some clusters containing both ≥30 classic public works
 and ≥10 expanded public works-­ eligible households.
 Clusters were formed from one or more contiguous
 villages so that one coach could provide services to all
 eligible families in that cluster maintaining a caseload of
 five families per coach. Within the same cluster, villages

 50% chance of being assigned to receive Sugira Muryango, we were not guaranteed an equal number of Sugira Muryango and

 clusters. ePw, expanded public works; cPW, classic public works.

<section> were selected to be as proximate as possible and as distal
 from other clusters as possible, such that after random
 assignment to SM or UC, risk of diffusion to UC fami-
 lies would be minimised. Given the limited reach of
 expanded public works programming at the time of the
 CRT, 100% of clusters containing at least 10 expanded
 public works families were sampled for participation
 in the study. Clusters containing classic public works
 families (including combined clusters) were randomly
 sampled for inclusion in the CRT until the target sample
 size of ≥1040 households. Randomisation was completed
 at the cluster level within strata defined by public works
 type (expanded public works only, combined expanded
 public works/classic public works and classic public
 works only) and geographical sector. By strata, clusters
 were assigned random numbers and placed on a ranked
 list. On the randomly ranked list, the first half of clusters
 were assigned to SM. In case of an uneven number of
 clusters per strata, randomisation was used to round the
 number assigned to SM up or down. After cluster assign-
 ment, households were invited to participate in the study.
 We retained clusters if at least five families in the classic
 public works strata or at least one family in the expanded
 public works strata enrolled and had at least one child
 aged 6–36 months. The final sample encompassed
 clusters: 48 expanded PW-­ only clusters, 38 expanded
 PW/classic PW clusters, and 112 classic PW-­only clusters
 were retained (figure 3). Given the ongoing roll-­out of 
<section> the expanded public works programme during the design
 phase for the CRT, it was not possible to have expanded
 public works families make up half of our sample, thus,
 calculations were based on an assumption of 91 expanded
 public works clusters and 104 classic public works clusters
 with five households per cluster assigned to SM and UC
 conditions. After the calculation, further adjustments
 were made, by adding combined clusters of expanded
 public works clusters and classic public works randomly
 allocated to condition. Adding more classic public works
 clusters allowed us to maintain power to test SM versus
 UC on the primary hypotheses. The CRT enrolled a total
 of 1049 households. Randomisation by cluster allocated
 n=508 families to UC and n=541 families to SM. The
 overall average number of households per cluster was
 6.2 (SD: 2.4), with an average number of households per
 cluster of 6.0 (SD: 2.2) for UC families and 6.3 (SD: 2.6)
 for SM families.
 
<section> Intervention component
 The intervention was implemented from 7 May 2018 to
 14 September 2018. The intervention was staggered by
 district to ensure it started within 2 weeks of baseline data
 collection. SM is a home-­visiting-­based intervention that
 uses psychoeducation and active coaching of caregivers
 to promote responsive caregiving, nutrition, hygiene and
 nonviolent interactions among household members (see
 figure 1 and online supplemental table 1 for overview of
 intervention content). Active participation and engage-
 ment of both female and male caregivers (as present in
 the home) in childcare and household-­related decision
 making was encouraged throughout the programme.
 Each visit included a 15-­min active play session, in which
 caregivers received live feedback on parent–child interac-
 tions to support and enhance responsive care following
 the UNICEF and the WHO Care for Child Development
 package 20 and Nurturing Care Framework. 21 Flexible
 scheduling and messaging during the visits encouraged
 engagement of male caregivers in play and nurturing
 care along with female caregivers. The coaches also
 helped families navigate formal resources such as govern-
 ment programmes to promote child health and nutrition
 including supplemental nutrition for malnourished chil-
 dren and informal supports such as those from neigh-
 bours and extended family to address issues such as family
 conflict and housing insecurity. The core evidence-­based
 parenting curriculum, which makes up the backbone of
 the SM intervention, was originally developed and tested
 in HIV/AIDS-­ affected Rwandan families with school-­
 aged children, which included nonviolent parenting and
 caregiver conflict resolution strategies. 22 During previous
 pilot studies, 19 23 a non-­ HIV/AIDS-­ specific version of
 the SM home-­ visiting programme with an ECD focus
 was developed by integrating UNICEF/WHO Care for
 Child Development 20 materials with additional framing
 consistent with the WHO and UNICEF Nurturing Care
 Framework. 21 SM comprises 12 modules (see online
 supplemental table 1 for details) that are delivered by
 coaches at a pace of about one module per week. Each
 module takes an average of 60 min.
 Home-­ visiting modules facilitated by the coaches
 involved participation of female and male caregivers (as
 present) in interaction with their child(ren) whereby
 ‘serve and return’ (ie, responsive) interactions were
 pointed out and coached to encourage responsive and
 stimulating parent–child interactions. Other caregivers
 and children in the household were welcome to partic-
 ipate. Sessions were facilitated in participating families’
 homes, unless contraindicated due to privacy concerns.
 Three-­ month and 6-­ month booster sessions occurred
 from 18 November 2018 to 7 December 2018 and 4
 March to 30 March 2019, respectively. The aim of each
 booster visit was to reconnect with families, identify and
 address ongoing challenges, and engage caregivers in an
 ‘active play’ session as modelled in each home-­visiting
 session (described below); each booster visit was approx-
 imately 1 hour.
 The coaches delivering SM were selected from the local
 community using a three-­step process: (1) nomination
 from community members; (2) a phone screening and
 (3) an intensive in-­person interview in which applicants
 were given a curriculum vignette of a challenging family
 situation and asked to explain the vignette, instructed
 to explain an image shown from the curriculum, which
 depicted family unity, nutrition, father engagement and
 early stimulation, and administered a writing test to
 capture demographic information and answer brief ques-
 tions to identify any prior experience they may have had
 delivering community-­ based programmes (see online
 supplemental table 2 for detail on training, supervision
 and incentive practices). Prior to the start of the interven-
 tion, coaches participated in a 3-­week training (120 hours),
 followed by a multilayered approach to supervision that
 included in-­person supervision during the first 3 weeks
 of programme delivery, weekly telephone supervision
 (approximately 12 hours total) and monthly in-­person
 group supervision. Additionally, weekly in-­person peer
 support groups, facilitated by lead coaches, were held to
 complement supervision strategies and promote transfer
 of audiorecordings for fidelity monitoring using lead
 coaches’ computers (approximately 15 hours total).
 Coaches received training on confidentiality and risk of
 harm protocols. Coaches received a monthly stipend of
 RWF28 000 (caseload of five households).
 Families in both the intervention households and the
 UC condition were eligible for the social protection
 public works programme and services as usual from the
 Rwandan government and its partners. There was no
 incentive associated with participation in SM but all fami-
 lies (SM and UC) received a stipend (RWF5000 equal to
 3 kg of rice) after each data collection time point. Data
 collection was carried out by trained local enumerators
 working for an independent research firm, who were
 blind to the intervention status of the families. Enumer-
 ators signed confidentiality agreements embedded in
 their contracts and were trained to identify cases of risk 
<section> of harm. Assessments were conducted in Kinyarwanda in
 the family’s home, except anthropometric measurements
 which were taken at the local health centre. All question-
 naires were developed from pilot intervention research
 and were forward-­ translated and back-­ translated from
 English to Kinyarwanda following standard WHO proce-
 dures. 23 Data were entered on Android tablets. Baseline
 assessments were conducted between 23 April 2018 and 1
 June 2018, with immediate postintervention assessments
 conducted between 13 August 2018 and 30 September
 2018, and 12-­ month follow-­ up assessments conducted
 between 19 August 2019 and 30 September 2019.
 
<section> Outcome measures
 The primary caregiver provided information about the
 household, including family composition and assets. Per
 our conceptual model (figure 1), the post-­ treatment
 (3 month) outcomes focused on change in caregiver prac-
 tices, including parent–child interactions, diet, health/
 hygiene, family functioning and family violence. 24 The
 12-­month primary outcomes, assessed here, focused on
 changes in children’s motor, language, cognitive and
 social development, as well as violence reduction, and
 father’s engagement in caregiving. Secondary outcomes
 were child stunting (ie, child height for age equal to or
 more than 2 SD below age and sex norms) and related
 anthropometric assessments.
 Child motor, language, cognitive and social devel-
 opment was assessed using the Ages and Stages Ques-
 tionnaire (ASQ-3), 25 and the Malawi Developmental
 Assessment Tool (MDAT). 26 The ASQ-3 is a series of
 age-­specific questionnaires designed to screen for devel-
 opmental delay of children in the areas of gross motor
 skills, fine motor skills, communication and problem
 solving. We administered the ASQ-3 through interviews
 with the primary caregiver. No developmental cut-­offs for
 the ASQ-3 have been validated for use in Rwanda, thus,
 we used continuous scoring using standard guidelines for
 obtaining norm-­referenced z-­scores using means and SD
 from reference samples in South Africa and Zambia.
 The MDAT is an observational, task-­based measure used
 to asses child development across domains of gross motor,
 fine motor, language and socioemotional development.
 The MDAT was developed for use in Malawi with the aim
 to be culturally appropriate for use in rural Africa. 26 The
 MDAT assessment was performed by trained enumera-
 tors. We obtained norm-­referenced z-­scores using means
 and SD from the Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition
 Efficacy study from Zimbabwe.
 Children’s anthropometric growth was assessed using
 measures of standardised height-­ for-­ age (HAZ), stan-
 dardised weight-­for-­age (WAZ), standardised weight-­for-­
 height (WHZ) and middle upper arm circumference
 (MUAC). In coordination with community health workers
 and local leaders, enumerators conducted child growth
 assessments in centralised locations using locally sourced
 MUAC tapes and height boards and scales purchased in
 the USA. The scales were calibrated every day before data
 collection using a weighing bag as a standard weight, to
 check that the scales read the same weight at the begin-
 ning of every day. If the measurements differed in any
 way, the team checked the equipment and changed
 batteries if needed to make sure the scales were accu-
 rate. Height was measured in centimetres to the nearest
 0.1 cm. Weight was measured in kilograms to the nearest
 1 g. Middle upper arm circumference was measured in
 centimetres to the nearest 0.1 cm. Standardisation was
 done using WHO Anthro Survey Analyser software.
 Father engagement was measured using an item from
 the Home Observation for Measurement of the Envi-
 ronment Inventory, 30 namely ‘father spends time every
 day caring for the child’ with response options ‘yes/no’
 reported by the primary caregiver. Violent and nonvio-
 lent discipline practices were assessed using the UNICEF
 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey Child Development
 and Child Disciplinary modules, as reported by the
 primary caregivers. 31 Exposure to violent disciplinary
 practices included being shouted or screamed at, called
 demeaning names, shaken, spanked, slapped or beaten.
 These exposures were summed to create a continuous
 score. Intimate partner violence was assessed by the
 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey’s Domestic
 Violence Module among caregivers who reported being
 currently married, cohabitating or in a relationship. 32 We
 report experiences of physical or sexual abuse victimisa-
 tion among female caregivers and perpetration of abuse
 among male caregivers within the last 3 months. Adverse
 events were defined as severe malnutrition or illness of
 the child, caregiver suicidality, reports of severe violence
 or the death of a caregiver or child.
 
<section> Sample size calculation
 Data from two previous pilot studies were used to estimate
 power and determine sample size for a 0.18 minimum
 detectable standardised effect size (d) on child develop-
 ment and violence reduction outcomes for the postinter-
 vention and 12-­month follow-­up period assuming power
 of 0.8 and a standard two-­tailed alpha level of p<0.05 using
 Optimal Design V.3.01. Estimated intraclass correlation
 for geographical clusters was 0.03 for parent–child inter-
 actions based on published pilot data, 19 23 and a baseline
 survey conducted in collaboration with UNICEF.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 Effectiveness of SM was determined based on significant
 differences in the slope of the response variable for SM
 families compared with UC. Data were analysed by fitting
 a linear mixed effect model for continuous outcomes
 where the primary predictors were treatment group
 (SM vs UC), time as a continuous variable, and their
 two-­way interaction all of which were included as fixed
 effects. The model had three levels of nesting: children/
 caregivers are measured within measurement waves,
 and measurement waves are nested within randomisa-
 tion cluster or region. Since we expect region-­level and
 time-­level effects, subject-­specific slopes and intercepts

 Table 1 Estimated difference-­in-­difference coefficients for continuous, binary and count outcomes

 were modelled as random effects nested within rando-
 misation clusters. Additionally, the type of public works
 programme the family participated in (a stratifier) was
 modelled as a fixed effect. Binary outcomes were esti-
 mated using generalised linear mixed models with
 a binomial distribution and logistic link, and count
 outcomes were analysed using multilevel mixed-­effects
 negative binomial models. Other details of the model
 are the same as the linear model described above. We
 defined significance as observing p<0.05 (two tailed) for
 the interaction term between treatment and time. We
 also report adjusted effect sizes as the marginal effects
 from the mixed effects models (marginal effect for
 continuous outcomes and ORs for binary outcomes) for
 the baseline to immediate postintervention and baseline
 to 12-­month follow-­up assessments (table 1). Analyses
 were conducted in StataMP V.16. 34 Under intention-­to-­
 treat assumptions, we replaced lost cases using multiple
 imputation via the HOTDECK plug-­ in module for
 Stata 35–38 by randomly selecting five cases matched on
 sex, public works programme type, household structure,
 age and treatment group for child outcomes; caregiver
 cases were matched on public works programme type,
 age, educational achievement and treatment group. This
 is preferred to carrying the last observation forward, a
 method now widely understood to be problematic.
 Quality assurance checks were conducted during data
 collection using proprietary audit algorithms to review
 survey metadata and flag unusual submissions for further
 investigation by a trained data manager and senior field
 supervisor. A random sample of 10% of all surveys were
 automatically recorded and reviewed by a supervisor to 
<section> ensure enumerators followed appropriate data collection
 protocols.

<section> Per Sex and Gender Equity in Research guidelines, we
 explored baseline equivalence and potential differen-
 tial intervention effects by child sex by rerunning all
 models including a main effect of gender, a treatment-­

 tion and a treatment-­by-­gender-­by-­time point interac-
 tion.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Baseline data were collected on 1084 children and 1498
 caregivers and intimate partners. Loss to-­follow-­up at
 12 months (2.0% for children; 9.6% for caregivers) and
 item-­level missing data (0.1%–2.5%) were low across the
 outcomes. Table 2 provides sample descriptive statistics.
 Caregivers ranged in age from 18 to 84 years at baseline
 and were most often the biological mother (n=950), the
 biological father (n=433), or a grandparent (n=96). A
 total of 70% (n=1048) of the included caregivers were
 primary caregivers and 30% were secondary caregivers.
 Among the primary caregivers, 98.9% were female.
 Among the secondary caregivers 98.4% were male. At
 baseline, 64% of the caregivers were married or cohab-
 itating, 61% of the families reported high levels of food
 insecurity and 48% of the children were stunted as
 defined by a standardised HAZ score below −2 SD of
 the reference population at baseline.
 Results from the linear growth models and marginal
 effects are shown in table 1. Raw means and SD are

<section> supplemental table
 We observed differences in change over time
 between SM and UC on the ASQ-3. Intervention fami-
 lies improved more across the domains of gross motor
 (β=0.294, 95% CI: 0.118 to 0.470), communication
 (β=0.139 95% CI 0.009 to 0.268), problem solving
 (β=0.159, 95% CI 0.035 to 0.282) and personal-­social
 development (β=0.148, 95% CI 0.023 to 0.273). We did
 not see any significant group differences in change on
 fine motor development.
 We did not observe any significant group differences in
 changes on the MDAT across any of the domain scores:
 gross motor, fine motor, language and socioemotional
 development.
 Regarding child growth, at 12-­month follow-­up, we
 did not observe any significant intervention effects on
 HAZ, WAZ, WHZ or MUAC (all 95% CIs crossed zero).
 Among families with a father in the household, father
 engagement increased more in families receiving SM
 compared with UC (OR=1.592, 95% CI 1.069 to 2.368).
 Families receiving SM also showed a greater decrease
 in the use of harsh discipline (IRR=0.741, 95% CI
 
<section> 0.657 to 0.835). Among those in dual-­caregiver house-
 holds, we found that female caregivers receiving SM
 showed a greater decrease in intimate partner violence
 (IRR=0.616, 95% CI 0.458 to 0.828). However, there
 was no significant reduction of male caregiver reported
 perpetration of violence towards their partner.
 Adverse events were reported to SM staff by coaches
 and enumerators within 24 hours of identification.
 From baseline to the 12-­month follow-­up assessment,
 28 risk of harm cases were reported among interven-
 tion families while 27 occurred in the UC group (details
 in online supplemental file 1). These households were
 retained in the analyses under intention to treat.
 
<section> Effects of child sex
 Analyses examining baseline equivalence and interven-
 tion effects by child sex did not reveal any differences in
 intervention-­related improvements in male versus female
 children.
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> The primary hypotheses of greater improvements in
 child development, violence reduction and father
 engagement among families receiving the intervention
 compared with UC was supported for violence reduction,
 father engagement and developmental outcomes meas-
 ured by the parent-­reported ASQ-3. For family violence
 (ie, maternal reports of intimate partner violence and
 harsh discipline) and father engagement the hypothesis
 of greater improvement was supported at both points
 of intervention follow-­up. We did not see significantly
 greater improvements on the MDAT, however, and
 there was no evidence of greater improvement in the
 secondary anthropometric growth outcomes. We have
 previously shown immediate post-­treatment (3 months)
 effects of SM on responsive caregiving, caregiver engage-
 ment in play activities with the child, decreased use of
 violent discipline and improvements in the mental
 health of male and female caregivers. 24 We also observed
 immediate pretreatment to post-­ treatment increases
 in caregiver behaviours to support healthy child devel-
 opment including increased dietary diversity, hygiene
 behaviours and healthcare seeking for sick children
 among participants in SM relative to families in UC.
 Our theory of change (figure 1) would predict that
 such changes in parenting behaviours, in turn, would
 be lead to improvements in long-­term ECD and growth
 outcomes. The combination of significant caregiver
 behavioural change immediately post-­ treatment, and
 improvement in developmental milestones and sustain-
 ment of violence reduction at 12-­month postintervention
 follow-­up supports this theoretical foundation of SM. By
 linking an ECD programme into an existing social protec-
 tion infrastructure, SM was able to identify and reach the
 most vulnerable population of caregivers in Rwanda,
 those classified as being most vulnerable according to the
 government’s poverty ranking system. The linkage with

 a social protection programme may introduce several
 other benefits. For example, integration of a parenting
 intervention within social protection systems may result
 in higher participation rates and stronger social buy-­in
 around the parenting programme. Moreover, combined
 ECD and social protection programmes may benefit
 from several synergistic effects because social protection
 programmes tend to provide important benefits such as
 access to health insurance and healthcare, nutritional
 counselling and/or supplements, and cash for work that
 can be directed towards food, and other vital househod
 expenses, all of which impact a family’s ability to provide
 a safe and healthy environment for a child.
 The use of active coaching allowed SM to involve
 all family members, including fathers and other male
 caregivers present in the household in nurturing care
 as reflected in increased father engagement. Indeed,
 we note that father engagement is one of the strongest 
<section> effects of SM, especially postintervention where fathers
 in SM families were 2.5 times more likely to have engaged
 with their child in the past 24 hours, compared with
 control fathers. Flexible scheduling and messaging about
 the importance of fathers in ensuring a nurturing and
 safe environment for young children to grow and thrive
 resulted in both high module attendance by fathers and
 a significant relative increase in fathers’ involvement in
 childcare. This adds to the important and growing litera-
 ture on ways to engage fathers in ECD interventions and
 childcare responsibilities. Previous work from Uganda
 found that use of father-­only sessions, exploitation of
 men’s pre-­existing motivation to improve their children’s
 behaviour, and interactive delivery helped to engage
 
<section> fathers
 SM also maintained effects on reduced violence,
 including reduced violent discipline and reduced
 maternal reports of intimate partner violence observed
 immediately postintervention and again 1 year after
 the intervention ended. 24 We did not retain the reduc-
 tion of paternal-­ reported perpetration of intimate
 partner violence observed immediately postintervention.
 Violence reduction is a key aim of SM and is achieved
 through a combination of psychoeducation and coaching
 on topics ranging from mindfulness meditation tech-
 niques, conflict resolution, alternative strategies to harsh
 discipline, the harmful effect of harsh discipline, the
 benefits of responsive care and father engagement in
 childcare. We believe that the use of active coaching and
 instruction was central in establishing persistent changes
 in caregiver behaviours. The inclusion of violence reduc-
 tion was motivated by previous identification of violence
 as a key challenge to ECD among young children in
 Rwanda. 33 During the intervention, coaches became
 aware of several incidents of violence in the families
 they served and worked closely with their supervisor and
 village officials to assess and resolve such situations and to
 link families with existing resources.
 Key strengths of the study compared with prior
 related studies include the rigorous, well-­powered CRT
 design and randomisation, including the blinding of the
 enumerators to treatment condition and geographical
 separation of SM locations from UC. The use of a strat-
 ified randomised clustered design with larger numbers
 of both clusters and families is a marked improvement
 over studies recently reviewed systematically 12 and found
 in our own review of more recent studies. 13–17
 With regard to cognitive developmental outcomes, the
 results from the ASQ-3 and MDAT were not consistent.
 The MDAT was new to the Rwandan setting; it is possible
 that revision of items and other refinements may be
 necessary to ensure its sensitivity to change over time in
 that environment. Although both the ASQ-3 (caregiver
 report) and MDAT (direct assessment) were originally
 developed as screening tools to detect developmental
 delay, not growth trends, the ASQ-3 has been widely used
 in previous intervention studies in settings as diverse as
 Rwanda, 23 China 17 and Peru 41 and found to be sensitive to
 effects of home-­visiting and parenting interventions. 42–44
 The observed effects on the parent-­reported ASQ-3, in
 the absence of similar effects on observational measures,
 may suggest that parenting interventions change or sensi-
 tise parents’ perception of their child’s behaviours and
 abilities, and thus affect the parents’ ability to provide
 parent reports over time. Moreover, although interven-
 tion and control families were exposed to the same test
 batteries, parents receiving the intervention may feel
 more encouraged to report on their children’s develop-
 mental milestones because they know they received an
 intervention. Interestingly, a similar discrepancy between
 parent report vs an observer rating was found in an eval-
 uation of Peru’s home-­ visiting Cuna Mas programme
 wherein a programme delivery fidelity measure was
 found to correlate significantly with the ASQ-3 scores,
 but not with the Bayley scales, 45 a gold-­standard observa-
 tional measure administered by selected highly trained
 psychology graduates.
 SM also did not lead to improvements in child growth.
 While the 95% CI crosses zero for all estimated effects
 on growth outcomes, we saw a small negative trend
 towards lower MUAC in the SM children at the 12-­month
 follow-­up, but this was not significant. Several factors may
 explain the absence of positive intervention effects on
 children’s anthropometric outcomes. At baseline, 48% of
 the children were stunted, which is known to decrease the
 opportunity to change a child’s growth trajectory, because
 the effects of early malnutrition are difficult to reverse.
 Although the curriculum addresses child feeding, nutri-
 tion and hygiene with the aim of improving children’s
 health and growth, a behavioural intervention with active
 coaching on nurturing care may not be enough to cause
 measurable improvements in anthropometric growth,
 particularly among extremely vulnerable households and
 already malnourished children. For example, parental
 training in diet among parents in extreme poverty
 without additional direct nutrition support may not be
 adequate to overcome past and present malnutrition.
 In future research, the impact of SM on child growth
 may be intensified if combined with other programmes,
 such as child-­focused conditional cash transfers, agricul-
 tural and food supplementation, health, water, sanitisa-
 tion and hygiene programmes. Future research should
 also test the proposed mechanistic pathways of change
 in child outcomes via changes in caregiver behaviours
 put forward in our theory of change. Moreover, future
 analyses looking at potential moderators of interven-
 tion outcomes (beyond child sex) should be explored
 to understand whether certain subpopulations benefit
 more or less from the intervention.
 Our results are consistent with other studies that have
 examined child development and parental behaviour
 outcomes in the context of combined ECD and govern-
 ment social protection programmes. In Colombia, an
 ECD programme that delivered psychosocial stimula-
 tion (and micronutrient supplementation) to beneficia-
 ries of the Familias en Acción conditional cash transfer 
<section> programme yielded promising short-­ term impacts on
 parenting behaviours and child cognitive develop-
 ment. 5 Specifically, the parenting intervention, which
 consisted of weekly home visits by beneficiary-­ elected
 female community leaders over an 18-­month period, was
 associated with statistically significant improvements in
 cognition (effect size 0.26 SD) and receptive language
 (effect size 0.22 SD). Similarly, results from a randomised
 controlled trial of a home-­based parenting intervention
 delivered by local NGOs to households participating in
 Niger’s unconditional cash transfer programme (Niger
 Safety Nets) also lend support for integrated approaches
 to supporting the holistic development of children
 living in poverty. Among families who participated in
 the ECD intervention, a combination of monthly home
 visits and small group meetings, they found that chil-
 dren had moderate improvements in socioemotional
 development, and parents interacted with their chil-
 dren around activities such as storytelling, counting or
 drawing more frequently and were less likely to use harsh
 disciplinary practices. 46 Overall, these along with current
 findings suggest that integrated ECD and social protec-
 tion programmes hold promise for improvements in
 child cognitive development and parenting behaviours.
 Evidence for anthropometric gains in combined ECD and
 social protection programmes, however, remains elusive.
 The potential for combined ECD and social protection
 such as cash transfer programmes to have synergistic
 effects remains inconclusive and understudied since most
 studies use social protection as a platform for identifying
 their beneficiaries and don’t include an ECD-­only arm.
 SM, a brief, comprehensive ECD intervention delivered
 by lay coaches, successfully targeted and reached fami-
 lies living in extreme poverty and provided an oppor-
 tunity for parenting support to complement income
 support through two public works programmes. SM is
 designed to be deployment-­focused, relatively brief and
 delivered by lay workers with strong fidelity monitoring
 and quality improvement-­ focused supervision. Scaling
 out the programme to reach large numbers of families
 in extreme poverty might best be achieved through the
 utilisation of a pre-­existing government workforce. In
 Rwanda, such a work force includes the inshuti z’umury-
 ango (friends of the family) child protection worker and
 other community health workforces. Linkage of ECD
 programmes to the existing social protection platform,
 as explored in this study, has several advantages; it targets
 the most disadvantaged, supports equity, and coordinates
 with other interventions (eg, food supplementation,
 conditional cash transfers). Combined provision of social
 protection and ECD intervention may also have several
 synergistic effects because even greater gains, espe-
 cially on anthropometric growth may be possible if the
 programme were integrated explicitly with a programme
 providing nutritional supplementation. Such synergistic
 effects will be important to unpack in future research.
 From an implementation standpoint, coordination
 across sectors (health and social protection) need to be
 explored further. Supervision in these systems would need
 to be addressed to support the workforce to deliver and
 sustain quality in delivery of the programme which likely
 requires a different set of competencies. Testing imple-
 mentation strategies for scaling out the intervention and
 innovations in structures for sustainment including atten-
 tion to quality improvement models to support sustained
 high-­quality supervision will be critical future research.
 A number of study limitations should be noted. First,
 given the large sample size and focus on vulnerable fami-
 lies, some families enrolled in this study may also have
 been eligible for, and participated in, other interventions
 beyond SM and the public works programme. During the
 selection of target districts, we spoke with a broad range
 of implementors and funders of related programmes to
 map ongoing interventions and we selected the targeted
 districts based on minimal overlap with other interven-
 tions. Still, we cannot rule out the possibility that some
 families may have participated in other interventions that
 could influence results, although this should not differ
 between SM and control families. We also note that this
 study tested the linkages of an ECD intervention with a
 social protection programme. Synergistic effects of ECD
 intervention and social protection may mean that find-
 ings from the current study do not necessarily gener-
 alise to poor families who do not have access to social
 protection programmes. A second limitation is that key
 outcomes related to violence in the home and child devel-
 opment assessed on the ASQ is based on parental report.
 This always introduces some potential for reporting bias.
 In particular, participation in the study and intervention
 may have sensitised parents to observing changes in these
 outcomes.
 
<section> CONCLUSION
 This CRT integrated SM into Rwanda’s social protection
 programme as a platform for targeting poor and vulner-
 able families with the potential for transitioning the
 SM programme to scale. In particular, the programme
 had a large and persistent effect on engaging fathers in
 childcare. Moreover, we also saw smaller but significant
 effects on violence reduction including intimate partner
 violence and harsh discipline as well as child develop-
 ment. With continued attention to quality and fidelity,
 evidence-­based interventions such as SM can be scaled
 out across settings, providing the government of Rwanda
 and others with a critical tool for helping to break inter-
 generational cycles of poverty and violence.

<section> Patient and public involvement statement Design of the intervention was
 carried out with input and routine consultation from stakeholders at the Ministry
 of Gender and Family Promotion and the National Early Childhood Development
 Program in Rwanda. We engaged with village leaders and the Ministry of Local
 Government (MINALOC), which runs the Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Vision
 Umurenge Program, prior to and during the study implementation to discuss
 recruitment of participants and to inform them of the process and outcomes.
 Representatives from the data collection firm, Laterite, and our collaborators at
 the University of Rwanda, were closely involved in developing and refining the
 research-­questions, study design, selection of measures and assessment tools,
 and ethical procedures. During implementation, we worked closely with our field-­
 based implementation partner, FXB-­Rwanda, who provided training and supervision
 to the community-­based coaches to discuss ongoing implementation and emerging
 issues. At the end of the study, we communicated results at a local dissemination
 event which included all key stakeholders, including the Government of Rwanda
 and other organisations that implement child development programs in Rwanda.
 "The event included a facilitated discussion with program stakeholders, including
 local government officials and study interventionists, as well as a presentation, led
 by the Principal Investigator, on program outcomes, lessons learned and next steps.
