<section> settings like that in India. Diet, for instance, is not
 just about the calories consumed or the proportion of
 carbohydrates, proteins, and fat or adequacy of vitamins
 and other micronutrients in the food. It is a complex
 behavioural phenomenon that results from an interaction
 between where we live, what is available, what we can 
<section> afford, how much time we have to dedicate to the process
 of procuring and preparing food, and even what we are
 allowed in terms of family traditions, societal, religious,
 and gender norms (2).
 The link between diet and NCDs has been long
 established (3). In addition, other determinants have
 been identified as influencing dietary procurement and
 consumption behaviour at the individual and household
 (HH) level, including: (a) socio-economic status (SES) of
 HHs (4); (b) spending and food shopping pattern (5); (c)
 dietary pattern and preferences, including childrenâ€™s
 preferences (68); (d) overall time spent on food prepara-
 tion (kitchen time) (6); (e) lifestyle changes (6); and (f)
 HH food culture comprising tastes, choices, beliefs,
 and rules related to food and meal times, structure,
 content, and company (9, 10). Moreover, local cultural
 context, political climate, economic and trade policies,
 and the effects of globalization all influence and shape
 dietary behaviours in many ways (1113). Tackling the
 growing burden of NCDs related to unhealthy diet,
 therefore, necessitates a combination of approaches (14).
 NCDs are the leading cause of death in India (42%)
 in all regions, though it is highest in the southern states
 (15). Kerala, one of the south Indian states and the
 setting for this study, is in a unique position as it is the
 most advanced among Indian states in the epidemiologic
 and demographic transition (16). It has the highest
 prevalence of most NCDs, including diabetes and cor-
 onary heart disease and their risk factors (16, 17). It
 also stands out from the rest of India because of its
 high literacy, including high female literacy and health
 indicators that are comparable to many high-income
 countries (16).
 Most of the initial NCD intervention studies con-
 ducted among the adult population in India have focused
 on diabetes and included diet as a component of lifestyle
 modification in a clinic or a community setting (18, 19).
 More recently, as part of an overall lifestyle modification
 program  with multiple strategies and activities covering
 individual and community empowerment, advocacy, and
 reorientation of health services  a community-based
 intervention for NCD risk factor reduction demonstrated
 only a modest, though statistically significant increase in
 the proportion of individuals consuming more than five
 servings per day of fruits and vegetables (FV) (women:
 from 3% at baseline to 5%, and men: from 5% at baseline
 to 9%) in spite of the very low baseline levels (20). Other
 intervention studies that have a dietary component have
 not yet published their results (21, 22).
 The dietary component of the NCD prevention or
 lifestyle modification interventions in the Indian context
 has been restricted to counselling by nutritionists based
 on the National Institute of Nutritionâ€™s dietary guidelines
 for Indians (23) and the cultural adaptation has been
 limited to the inclusion of local foods on the menu
 
<section> (19, 20). A couple of studies have included culturally
 appropriate dietary education: addressing cultural bar-
 riers to dietary change (18, 22); use of local facilitators to
 deliver lifestyle classes (22); promoting local low-cost
 resources; and using cooking demonstrations, recipe
 competitions, and model meals (18). In general, most
 dietary guidelines are theoretical recommendations based
 on calorie requirements for different population groups
 (23). Some countries have attempted to translate their
 national guidelines for the benefit of the general popula-
 tion using nutrition labels, like â€˜pick-the-tickâ€™ or the
 â€˜green keyholeâ€™ in New Zealand and Sweden, respectively
 (24). Such strategies will work in contexts where con-
 sumption of ready-to-eat or processed foods exceeds that
 of home-cooked foods (25). In contrast, food preparation
 is an expected and central activity in Indian HHs,
 intrinsically linked to a womanâ€™s identity, and food-
 cultures differ widely even within the different states
 (7). Hence, a gap exists, not just in the lack of translation
 of available scientific knowledge in a format that is
 understandable and useful to different stakeholders,
 including the general population (14), but also in its
 process of implementation, which is important for
 sustainable behavioural and health outcomes.
 
<section> Rationale
 
<section> Based on available evidence worldwide to decrease the
 population risk for major NCDs, World Health Organi-
 zation (WHO) has urged member states to concentrate on
 four behavioural risk factors: diet, physical activity,
 alcohol and tobacco use (26). Nine major risk factors
 have been identified for myocardial infarction in Asian
 men and women: smoking, raised Apo-B to Apo-A1
 ratio, history of hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obe-
 sity, psychosocial factors, daily inadequate consumption
 of FV, regular alcohol consumption, and inadequate
 physical activity (27). Five of these are directly related to
 diet.
 We know that information or awareness alone is
 insufficient to modify behaviour (28). This calls for
 context-specific behavioural and policy interventions (1)
 that attempt to change population behaviour within the
 framework of other complex issues like culture, society,
 and family. The resource crunch, together with the high
 prevalence of NCDs and the high cost of accessing health
 care (16, 29), makes it imperative to focus more seriously
 on prevention. Preferably, all levels of prevention should
 be strengthened with more thrust at the initial levels
 as they have the potential for maximum impact at the
 population level. Hence, one of the challenges is to
 translate the available knowledge effectively into practical
 day-to-day reality that becomes an integral part of a
 HHâ€™s dietary practices. So far, existing knowledge has
 remained at the level of general dietary recommendations
 in many low- and middle-income settings including India. 
<section> Considering the paucity of related knowledge transla-
 tion studies pertaining to the Indian context, we identi-
 fied the need to design an effective model to transfer
 available scientific knowledge through a practical and
 community-based approach, focusing on changing un-
 healthy diet. The objective of this paper is to describe the
 process of designing the community-based Behavioural
 Intervention for Diet (BID) study with the aim to change
 dietary behaviour in Kerala based on local context and
 addressing local needs.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> The Intervention Mapping Protocol (30) was used as
 the basis for the planning and development of the
 BID study. The Methods section is described in terms
 of the study setting, the methodology adopted for the
 formative research, and the detailed study design of
 a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the
 effectiveness of a community-based dietary behavioural
 intervention.
 
<section> Study setting
 Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) district with a popu-
 lation of about 3.3 million inhabitants was chosen for two
 reasons: its human development index is similar to that of
 Kerala state, making it fairly representative of the
 state (16); and its proximity to a premier public health
 institution in the country for ease of monitoring.
 
<section> Chirayinkeezhu taluk is one of the four revenue divisions
 of Thiruvananthapuram district with a population of
 thousand (about 130 thousand HHs). It is divided into
 four block panchayats which in turn consists of 22 grama
 panchayats (rural administrative unit) and two munici-
 pality areas (urban administrative unit). Each grama
 panchayat is further divided into 1017 smaller adminis-
 trative areas called wards.
 In terms of dietary practices, coconut is a major
 ingredient of the Kerala diet in the form of both fresh,
 grated coconut and coconut oil and accounts for 80%
 of the fat intake (17). Fish is the other major food item,
 but the benefits are greatly reduced by the popular habit
 of deep-frying. A recent cross-sectional investigation of
 regional dietary patterns in Kerala (Thiruvananthapuram
 district) revealed a pulses and rice primary pattern
 characterised by mixed dishes mainly composed of
 pulses and fermented rice and a secondary sweets and
 snacks pattern characterised by sweet and fried savoury
 snacks (31). The other major trends include the in-
 creased consumption of animal source proteins (17, 32),
 both at home and during functions (7); high rice
 and low vegetable consumption (7, 17); increased fre-
 quency of eating (three meals and at least two snacks
 daily) (7); and the increased tendency to eat-out re-
 flected in the rapid mushrooming of Gulf-style fast food
 restaurants (7).
 
<section> Formative research
 
<section> Formative research was carried out to: 1) understand the
 social determinants of dietary structure, dietary choices,
 and decision making in HHs, particularly issues relating
 to access; 2) understand myths related to foods, particu-
 larly FV; 3) understand the feasibility and acceptability
 for the proposed study; and 4) gain insight into the
 kind of strategies that may be practical at community and
 HH level. Three focus group discussions (FGDs) and
 17 in-depth interviews were conducted among residents
 of Chirayinkeezhu taluk. The participants were men and
 women aged between 24 and 75 years, and of different
 religions and socio-economic groups. An informal as-
 sessment of HH consumption and procurement of FV,
 salt, sugar, and oil was also carried out. Observations at
 market places and provision stores were also undertaken
 to understand the dynamics involved in the purchase of
 FV. For the quantitative verification of the prevalence
 of the behavioural risk factors, we used the results of
 two cross-sectional surveys done in the same population,
 namely WHO STEPs surveillance data (200305) (16)
 and a 5-year follow-up (2010) (Thirunavukkarasu S,
 unpublished results, 2010).
 A conceptual model was constructed, from a combina-
 tion of the trans-theoretical model of readiness-to-change
 (33), and two theories of social cognition, namely the
 Health Belief Model (34) and the Theory of Planned
 Behaviour (35), and modified after the formative research
 to incorporate ground realities. The conceptual model
 is composed of three parts: a) a three-stage change
 model consisting of pre-contemplation, intention, and
 action, which has been modified from the original five-
 stage trans-theoretical model (33); b) â€˜impact factorsâ€™
 that influence or act at various stages and; c) serial
 processes that enable progress from one stage to the other
 called â€˜change processesâ€™. In addition, there are modifiers,
 which are the societal and gender norms and three
 overarching influences, namely affordability, availability,
 and perceived needs and preferences.
 Based on the formative research, a matrix on behaviour
 change objectives and what activities should be included
 in the programme was developed at three levels: indivi-
 dual, HH, and community (Tables 1 and 2).

<section> Study objectives
 We formulated our study objectives as follows:
 Major. To test the effectiveness of a sequential stage-
 matched intervention strategy to increase the prevalence
 of adequate daily intake of FV (five servings two
 Fruitsthree Vegetables) by an absolute 20% from base-
 line in the intervention arm over a one-year intervention
 period.

 Minor. 1) To increase HH procurement of FV by a
 minimum of 20% and decrease HH consumption of salt,
 sugar, and oil by a minimum of 10%; 2) To assess whether
 sequential stage-matched interventions can assist house-
 holds to progress through the different stages of change at
 subsequent follow-up points; and 3) To assess barriers
 and facilitating factors for dietary behaviour change in
 terms of change processes with particular reference to
 gender and SES.
 
<section> Study population
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> With an existing prevalence of 40% appropriate daily
 intake of FV (five servings) (Thirunavukkarasu S, unpub-
 lished results, 2010) and assuming a 20% improvement in
 the intervention arm, with a power of 80% and an alpha
 error of 0.05, the minimum sample size required to
 compare two groups was calculated to be 98 in each group
 (36). As intra-class cluster correlation coefficient was not
 available for the outcome of interest, we incorporated a
 design effect of two. Hence, the minimum required sample
 size at baseline would be 400 (200 intervention and 200
 control). To allow an attrition of 20%, and to ensure these
 numbers at end-line, considering a risk factor prevalence
 up to 50% (16) and individuals in the required age group of
 2545 years, we screened 1237 HHs and recruited
 individuals (intervention: 240, and control: 239). We
 developed a cluster RCT with fixed number of clusters
 (ayalkootams: 30 in each arm) and variable cluster size
 ranging from 6 to 11 (average cluster size: 8.5).
 A HH was found to be eligible for recruitment into the
 study if it fulfilled all of the following inclusion criteria:
 
<section> (1) Belonged to the middle SES.
 (2) Had adult males or females 2545 years of age.
 (3) Had resided in selected administrative areas (pan-
 chayats) of rural Chirayinkeezhu taluk for at least
 months prior to the screening survey.
 
<section> The SES of HHs were identified for 2011 based on HH
 monthly per capita expenditure using the 20042005
 poverty line (37) and the corresponding affluence line
 (38) for rural Kerala, after adjusting for inflation.
 One male or female individual aged 2545 years was
 selected in each HH after exclusions based on the following
 criteria: 1) Took two or more meals away from home on
 most weekdays; 2) Had definite plans of migration during
 the study period; 3) Was pregnant; or 4) Had self-reported
 diabetes, hypertension, deranged lipids on medical treat-
 ment, and mental or other serious illness.
 
<section> Sampling procedure
 We used a multistage stratified cluster RCT design
 whereby six grama panchayats were finally selected for
 the study (three in the intervention and three in the
 control arm) (Fig. 1). At the outset, three criteria
 were used for pairing of panchayats to ensure uniform
 distribution of key population characteristics and
 confounders in the control and intervention groups:
 1) coastal and non-coastal areas were paired separately;
 2) similar proportion of middle-income HHs; and
 
<section> 3) panchayats belonging to one pair or group should
 not share a border to prevent spill-over effect.
 All randomizations were done using an online random
 number generator from Random.org. After pairing the

 panchayats, one random number was selected which
 was allocated to the intervention arm and the remaining
 panchayat automatically became part of the control arm.
 In the group with three panchayats, two of them were
 randomly selected of which the first random number was
 allocated to the intervention arm and the second to the
 control arm. Further to this, five wards per panchayat and
 two ayalkootams per ward were randomly selected, before
 reaching the household level. At the household level, if
 more than one individual fulfilled the inclusion criteria,
 then Kish methodology was used (39). The age group 25
 45 years was targeted due to the high prevalence of
 migration in the younger age group and of NCDs among
 the older age group.
 Rural Kerala has neighbourhood groups organized
 through the Kudumbasree (women oriented, community
 based, and organized by the State Poverty Eradication
 Mission of Government of Kerala) known as ayalkoottams.
 
<section> These are present in each ward and composed of women
 members from the community. Approximately 80% of low-
 and middle-income HHs (at least one person from each
 HH) are enrolled in these units as registered members. The
 clusters in this study are the ayalkootams. Predominantly,
 low SES ayalkootams (verified through Kudumbasree
 registers) were excluded, and the ones remaining were
 used as the basis for random selection of clusters. All
 HHs falling within geographic limits of the selected
 ayalkoottams were listed and screened before inclusion
 and exclusion criteria were applied. The final selection of
 HHs was proportionate to the numbers screened per
 ayalkootam and ranged from six to eleven HHs.
 
<section> Intervention components
 The intervention was applied at the HH and ayalkootam
 level. Intervention strategies at the individual level
 comprised of participation in the initial face-to-face
 counselling and the community-based awareness classes
 (Fig. 2). The strategies developed were applied in a

<iend>

 staggered manner in the intervention areas, while the
 control areas received minimal intervention in the form of
 information on recommended levels of intake of the five
 dietary components, and general dietary information
 leaflets at the end of the baseline survey. The intervention
 strategies are outlined below as general strategies that
 were applicable to all HHs, irrespective of stage of
 change, and stage-matched strategies that were applied
 based on a HHâ€™s stage of change.
 
<section> General strategies (iiv)
 
<section> (i) 
<section> Counselling: Counselling was performed face-to-
 face at the beginning of the intervention, and via
 telephone at six months. The contents of each
 counselling session were however tailored to the
 specific stage-of-change to help HH members choose
 appropriate stage-matched strategies. Each counsel-
 ling session was accompanied by a simultaneous
 home visit, when a community volunteer demon-
 strated the most effective method of applying the
 chosen strategy.
 (ii) Telephonic reminder: This was done at two different
 time points by the community volunteers or study
 coordinator who called the female head of the HH
 and if possible the randomly selected individual.
 (iii) Awareness classes: Three adult awareness classes
 were conducted per ayalkootam facilitated by a
 trained resource person each addressing a different
 theme: 1) Diet and NCDs; 2) Colour way to health;
 3) Let us protect our familyâ€™s health. Separate
 flipcharts were prepared for each theme. Two
 childrenâ€™s awareness classes were conducted per
 ayalkootam, addressing the first two adult session
 themes, with a specially developed card game for
 each session. The sessions were open to all interested

 community members (not just recruited HHs) to
 foster a favourable environment that would encou-
 rage healthy dietary change among HHs in the
 locality.
 (iv) Sequential stage-matching: HHs were assessed re-
 garding progress through the three stages of change
 by re-staging during month 6, with the opportunity
 to choose additional strategies matched to the new
 stages. Initially, re-staging, telephonic counselling,
 and home visits were planned for two interme-
 diate time points, month 4 and 8. However, due to
 practical reasons, this was reduced to one inter-
 mediate time-point at month
 Stage-matched strategies (ae) 
<iend>

 (a) Easy Formula: HHs were equipped with a measure-
 ment kit, to enable them to measure their use of five
 dietary components on a regular basis. Based on felt
 need, we also translated daily consumption targets
 (individual and HH) for FV, salt, sugar, and oil
 to locally available HH measures provided through
 the kit. As per caloric requirements in the guide-
 lines (23), we calculated recommended levels of
 free sugars and cooking fat for a reference family
 identified from the latest available census data
 pertaining to Chirayinkeezhu taluk (40).
 (b) 
<section> Substitution: Substituting unhealthy food with heal-
 thier options: 1) fried snacks with fruits; 2) ready-
 to-eat or fried snacks with home-cooked or steamed
 snacks respectively; and 3) increasing the colour of
 the lunch plate by substituting a portion of the rice
 with raw or cooked vegetables.
 (c) 
<section> Visibility: Increasing the display of FV on the dining
 table or easily accessible locations in the house and
 decreasing the display and access for jams, pickles,
 and fried items.
 (d) 
<section> Local varieties: Encouraging the use of locally
 available FV, during house visits where the commu-
 nity volunteers helped the HHs to record the
 varieties they would be willing to try in their
 information booklet.
 (e) 
<section> Budget re-allocation: Teaching HHs how to reallo-
 cate their budgets to increase the money available
 to purchase FV without exceeding overall food
 budget. 
<section> The strategies (ae) were matched to specific stages of
 change, based on perceived difficulty derived from our
 
<section> formative research:
 
<section> (1) Pre-contemplation stage: only general strategies.
 (2) Intention stage: generalstage-matched strategies
 (ac).
 (3) Action stage: generalstage-matched strategies
 (ae).
 
<section> The counsellors helped the HH members to identify
 the strategies which they felt comfortable to try for the
 following 6 months from the strategies that were available
 to them, while the community volunteers helped them
 work out the details of the chosen strategies based on a
 pre-defined steps aided by specific tools.
 
<section> Intervention tools
 1) Information booklet for the intervention HHs out-
 lining the strategies and general dietary information
 leaflets for intervention and control HHs; 2) Household
 measurement kit which included: an oil jar to keep track
 of monthly HH consumption, a small graduated cup
 to measure oil for daily use tailored to each HH size,
 a serving spoon (thavi) to measure one serving of cooked
 vegetables, a fruit basket to display fruits or vegetables,
 and salt and sugar containers with 5 g scoops. Each item
 was labelled with catchy slogans and the recommended
 consumption level (per person per day) in the local
 language, Malayalam; 3) Flip charts outlining the content
 of the adult awareness classes and; 4) Two card games
 for teaching children about the concept of â€˜plusâ€™ (healthy)
 and â€˜minusâ€™ (unhealthy) foods and the importance of
 â€˜colours of healthâ€™ with respect to fruit and vegetable
 consumption. The information booklet, flip charts for
 the adultsâ€™ awareness classes, and card games for the
 childrenâ€™s awareness classes were designed by the first
 author (MD), pre-tested on appropriate but substitute
 target populations, and modified before training of
 resource persons. The information booklet was verified
 for content by three of the co-authors and an indepen-
 dent expert. The flip charts and card games were verified
 by two of the co-authors.
 
<section> Data collection
 
<section> Tools
 
<section> Tools were developed for: 1) screening; 2) data collection
 at the individual and HH level; 3) process documentation
 to keep track of and evaluate the various processes and
 strategies involved in the intervention; and 4) template
 counselling sheets specific to stage of change of the HH
 to guide counsellors during face-to-face and telephonic
 counselling. A new tool had to be developed and validated
 to identify the stage-of-change at HH level. All data
 collection tools were piloted three times before the start of
 the study.
 The HH-level data collection tool included demo-
 graphic information, food procurement and preparation
 habits and a 2-week procurement diary for FV, while
 individual-level data included demographic data, dietary
 intake habits, two 24-h dietary intakes (weekendweek-
 day), and a five-option evaluation of strategies at end-
 line. The 24-h recalls incorporated the multiple pass
 method (41): an initial listing of foods; followed by
 progressive addition of consumption amounts using pre-
 tested serving spoons to assess consumption of different
 food items; and incorporated a food map to allow recall
 of the place, occasion, and company during each meal to
 aid in remembering any forgotten meals. Salt, sugar, and
 oil intake for the HHs were assessed in terms of monthly
 consumption for the HH based on the amount procured
 and the duration of use. For sugars and oils, we collected
 data for different types of sugars, including jaggery, and
 different types of oils or fats, including hydrogenated oils,
 used in the HHs.
 Process documentation tools were developed for each of
 the intermediate points, namely face-to-face and telepho-
 nic counselling, adults and childrenâ€™s awareness classes and
 telephone reminders. These enabled the documentation of
 the number and type of participants, problems faced and
 any other general comments.
 
<section> Process
 
<section> Quantitative data collection started with a screening
 after which the inclusion and exclusion criteria were
 applied followed by baseline data collection from the
 recruited HHs at the individual and HH level. All
 data except the four-point evaluation were collected at
 baseline and repeated after one-year. The qualitative part
 of data collection consists mainly of the in-depth inter-
 views and FGDs at the end of one-year, which addresses
 barriers and facilitators for behaviour change based on
 change processes, factors that favour sustenance of
 behaviour change over longer periods and understanding
 gender and socio-economic dimensions of dietary beha-
 viour change process.
 
<section> Monitoring
 
<section> Process documentation tools were used to monitor all
 key activities. Using the tools, we tracked and ensured
 that the different strategies at different time points were
 delivered to each HH. For the community awareness
 sessions, the attendance was recorded, and attendance
 by any members of the recruited HHs was specifically
 marked. In addition, quality checks were put in place to
 ensure that activities were carried out. For example,
 the community volunteer scheduled the counselling and
 house visits, not the team performing the activity. More-
 over, the coordinator carried out random telephone 
<section> checks by calling the HHs directly to enquire about a
 particular scheduled activity.
 
<section> Roles and responsibilities of team members
 Data collection and intervention delivery were carried
 out by 15 teams (five teams per panchayat) composed of
 two community volunteers, one each from the Kerala
 Mahila Samakhya Society (Kerala chapter of the â€˜Educa-
 tion for womenâ€™s equalityâ€™ programme launched by the
 Government of India) and the Kudumbasree, where at
 least one member was a local resident with good knowl-
 edge of the selected HHs and their members, key
 stakeholders, and local politics. All community volun-
 teers had a minimum of 10 years of schooling, had been
 involved in data collection for health-related surveys in
 the past, and had received training on data collection
 tools and methods.
 Four teams in each panchayat participated in the
 general data collection, while all volunteers were involved
 in the organization of the community awareness sessions
 in their respective areas. One team per panchayat was
 responsible for administering staging questionnaires in
 a panchayat other than their own to minimise socially
 desirable responses to the staging questions. The same
 teams also conducted house visits to explain the stage-
 based strategies in their own panchayat, as they only
 helped the HHs to work out the details of the strategies
 that they had chosen with the counsellors. These three
 teams (one from each panchayat) were excluded from the
 general data collection to prevent inducing social desir-
 ability bias. Three counsellors, who were outsiders to the
 community, conducted the counselling and community
 awareness sessions. Similarly, the study coordinator, who
 was also an outsider, conducted the overall monitoring
 and quality checks.
 
<section> Data analysis
 Intention-to-treat analysis will be used to evaluate the
 effectiveness of the intervention at two levels: HH
 and individual level, with adjustments for cluster design
 effects. Our primary outcome measures will include
 change in FV intake at individual level and FV procured
 at HH level over the study period. The secondary
 outcome measures include change in salt, sugar, and
 oil consumed at the HH level and proportion of HHs
 progressing across the stages of change at 6 and 12
 months. Barriers and facilitators for behaviour change
 will be analysed using content analysis of transcripts
 of interviews and FGDs conducted at the end of the
 intervention.
 
<section> Ethical considerations
 This study was conducted according to the guidelines
 laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research
 and all procedures involving the study participants were
 approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC)
 of Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences
 and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India
 (SCT/IEC-357/MAY-2011; Date: 11/06/2011). Partici-
 pants were recruited into the study only after written
 informed consent. The study was also registered prospec-
 tively under the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/
 2011/06/001839; Date: 28/06/2011) (42).
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> Context-specific factors influencing the study design
 Based on our formative research, we identified a number
 of context-specific factors that influenced the study
 design. First, the need to address the HH as the decision
 unit for food-related issues in rural Kerala, which has also
 been implied elsewhere (7). Hence, the stage of change
 had to be identified for the HH rather than the indi-
 vidual. We therefore developed and validated a staging
 tool for HHs, which, to the best of our knowledge, has
 not been attempted so far in any behavioural intervention
 study. We staged HHs to one of three stages and also
 devised an on-going mechanism to facilitate progress
 through the stages. Hence, the interventions were deliv-
 ered according to the stage of change in a sequential
 manner. Stage-matched strategies have been used in other
 studies (43, 44), but as far as we have found, this is the
 first study to attempt sequential stage-matching.
 Second, coastal and non-coastal areas differed in terms
 of foods consumed and access to FV markets. The study
 design had to ensure representation of both areas in the
 intervention and control arms; hence, stratification and
 pairing was carried out. Third, low SES HHs were found
 to be almost completely unresponsive and would require
 completely different strategies and some form of subsidy,
 which was beyond the scope of this study. Hence, the
 range of the middle class monthly per capita expenditure
 was calculated, and it was decided to exclude all families
 who fell on either sides of this range. Since Kerala has
 a large middle-income group (85%) (38), we still included
 the majority of the population. Moreover, the inter-
 vention clusters (ayalkootams) needed to be more homo-
 genous. Otherwise, we would have required multiple
 groups of interventions targeting different SES levels.
 Fourth, we identified a need to address salt, sugar,
 and oil consumption in addition to FV intake. The BID
 study was initially proposed as an intervention to increase
 FV intake, which was inadequate as per previous study
 findings (16, Thirunavukkarasu S, unpublished results,
 2010). During the informal assessment carried out as part
 of the formative research, HH consumption of salt, sugar
 and oil was found to be high. Since the majority of salt
 and oil consumption in transition economies is through
 HH cooking rather than processed or ready-to-eat foods
 (25), it was decided to focus our intervention on five 
<section> dietary components, namely fruits, vegetables, salt,
 sugar, and oil. Consumption of coconut products was
 also found to be high. This was addressed through the
 community awareness classes, focusing on reducing the
 use of coconut meat and using a mix of cooking oils
 during food preparation.
 Fifth, we also identified a need for easy measurement
 formulas, expressed by participants to understand the
 recommended levels for each of the five-targeted dietary
 components, in terms of per person per day measures.
 A HH measurement kit was assembled to partly address
 this gap. While recommended daily levels of intake were
 available for FV and salt, this was not the case for sugar
 (free sugar) and fats. Most dietary guidelines, including
 the one for Indians, advise visible fats as not exceeding
 10% of total energy intake (23). Therefore, relevant
 dietary recommendations were adjusted for local dietary
 practices (e.g. use of coconut), converted to per person
 per day levels, and translated to easy-to-use HH formulas
 using locally available measuring spoons.
 Finally, we also realised that promoting menâ€™s participa-
 tion would be important. Otherwise, we ran the risk of
 the whole project being labelled as a â€˜womenâ€™s issueâ€™ with
 very little or negligible male participation if all the study
 personnel were women. Spouseâ€™s preferences were found to
 be a key consideration in the dietary decision-making
 process. Hence, we decided to recruit men for the positions
 of counsellors and study co-ordinators, to encourage more
 male participation within the HHs and communities.
 
<section> Community as a driver and supporter of behaviour
 
<section> change
 
<section> Communities, peers and families have often been used
 as â€˜change agentsâ€™ for many community-based interven-
 tions (45). That they exert varying degrees of influence on
 individuals is well documented, which is precisely the
 reason why they work as â€˜change agentsâ€™. In complex
 multicultural societies like India and Kerala, the approval
 or support of these â€˜change agentsâ€™ is often crucial. It was
 not enough to increase awareness and educate the target
 HHs alone, we also had to devise strategies to enable
 communities to be more receptive, so that these changes
 became possible and even expected. A community or
 family that shuns or ridicules the proposed changes can
 cause serious setbacks. Hence, the communities and other
 HH members, particularly children, were also included
 as part of the broader intervention package. Due to the
 high prevalence of NCDs (16), most people were partly
 aware of this reality and even concerned, particularly
 for their children, which we identified as a powerful
 motivator.
 
<section> Sustainability as a key issue
 Finally, the study design had to incorporate elements,
 which would make long-term sustainability possible.
 To this end, the study made maximum use of existing
 infrastructure in the form of community volunteers, self-
 help group networks, and existing administrative divi-
 sions. The use of community volunteers is expected to
 minimise both non-response as well as dropout rates as
 they are living in these communities and know most of
 the study participants. Currently, many of them are
 also employed part-time through the Mahatma Gandhi
 National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, where
 they are paid daily rates for unskilled jobs. For a country,
 like India, that is struggling with unemployment on the
 one hand and lack of adequate health manpower on the
 other, this may represent a tremendous opportunity to
 link the two. This study has the potential to demonstrate
 that community volunteers, particularly in a highly liter-
 ate state like Kerala, can deliver complex interventions,
 provided they receive adequate training and that knowl-
 edge has been appropriately translated into a form that
 can be used by them. Training of community volunteers
 and constant reinforcement of this knowledge could
 enhance the basic knowledge and practice levels in their
 communities, thus improving the long-term sustainability
 of such interventions.
 
<section> Limitations and strengths
 We have not included the low and high SES. Even though
 middle class in Kerala comprises 85% of the population
 (38), this would still affect the generalizability of the
 results.
 In 2008, the pilot phase of the National Pro-
 gramme for prevention and control of Cancer, Diabetes,
 Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) was
 launched in seven states with one district each, including
 Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala state. The re-
 cruitment for the BID study started in August 2011.
 Awareness sessions aired on the state-run radio and tele-
 vision channels address all NCD risk factors, including
 diet, in general, and may have positively influenced the
 HHs to seriously participate in our intervention. How-
 ever, it is likely to impact both the intervention and
 control groups equally.
 This study was based on extensive formative research
 and addressed the felt needs of the community, which is a
 definite strength. The strict randomization process that
 was followed right down to the individual level minimises
 bias to a large extent. In terms of strategies developed
 to achieve the objectives, one of our major strengths is
 that none of the strategies try to achieve the objective
 through increasing the HH food budget; rather it is
 through re-allocation, use of nutritious local varieties,
 and the substitution of unhealthy food choices. Similarly,
 the inclusion of community volunteers, who have access
 to both the HHs and the local administration, had a
 positive influence on the acceptability of the intervention. 
<section> Conclusion
 It was possible to design a cluster-randomized intervention
 trial for dietary behaviour change, taking into account the
 socio-cultural context, the felt needs of the community,
 and the ground realities associated with existing dietary
 procurement, preparation, and consumption patterns.
 Some innovative tools and strategies were developed to
 assess a HHâ€™s readiness-to-change behaviour, increase
 awareness at HH and community level, and make the
 practical side of behaviour change easier through a HH
 measurement kit and easy formulas. The study design
 has also addressed some of the key issues raised during
 formative research, particularly the central role of the HH
 as the decision unit, and has tried to increase the long-term
 sustainability through the use of existing local and admin-
 istrative networks and community volunteers.
