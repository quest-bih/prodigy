<section> WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 
<section> ⇒ Antenatal iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation
 and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy
 (IPTp) are widely recognised as key strategies to re-
 duce maternal anaemia and malaria in pregnancy.
 
<section> ⇒ Previous research has provided evidence on the use
 of iron-­based therapies to prevent the incidence
 of anaemia for pregnant women and highlighted
 community-­delivered models of malaria prophylaxis
 in pregnancy, finding reductions in the risk of parasi-
 taemia between 25% and 70%.
 
<section> WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
 
<section> ⇒ Community-­ based information about antena-
 tal care combined with monthly supply of IFA and
 IPTp with sulfadoxine pyrimethamine greatly in-
 creases coverage of supplementation and malaria
 chemoprophylaxis.
 
<section> ⇒ Standard IFA supplementation is not sufficient to ad-
 dress the high prevalence of often-­severe anaemia
 in this low-­income setting.
 
<section> HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH,
 
<section> PRACTICE OR POLICY
 
<section> ⇒ Community-­ based distribution of malaria chemo-
 prophylaxis should be considered as strategy to re-
 duce malaria exposure in pregnancy.
 
<section> ⇒ Standard supplementation protocols currently rec-
 ommended in many low-­income and middle-­income
 countries (LMICs) are likely not sufficient to address
 the high burden of anaemia in many LMIC settings.
 
<section> ⇒ Prepregnancy supplementation, routine haemoglo-
 bin assessments during the first trimester and moni-
 tored administration of higher doses of supplements
 (oral or via injections) may offer potential solutions
 to this problem.
 
<section> are likely insufficient to address the prevalence of often
 severe anaemia in this population.

<section> INTRODUCTION
 Despite considerable reductions in under-­ 5 mortality
 between 1990 and 2019, sub-­Saharan Africa remains the
 region with the highest under-­5 mortality rate globally. 1
 Neonatal deaths currently account for about half of all
 under-­5 deaths, 3 and recent evidence suggests that many
 of these deaths could be prevented with improved access
 to essential antenatal care (ANC) services. 4–6 In many
 settings, exposure to malaria and maternal anaemia pose
 a major threat to maternal and child health. Evidence
 from sub-­Saharan Africa suggests that 46% of pregnant
 women are anaemic, 7 and more than 11 million cases of
 malaria in pregnancy were reported in 2018. 8 Both risk
 factors can, in principle, be addressed by adequate ANC.
 However, coverage of essential antenatal interventions
 remains limited in many low-­income and middle-­income
 countries, 9 resulting in high prevalence of anaemia 10 and
 limited prevention of malaria in pregnancy. 11–13 Chal-
 lenges faced in many health systems include supply factors
 such as distance, interrupted supply and stock-­outs, and
 high cost of care, and demand-­side factors such as limited
 education and social–cultural barriers. 14 15 In 2018, a
 systematic review of studies evaluated the impact of strat-
 egies including community-­based treatment, distributor
 incentives, distribution along kinship networks, intensi-
 fied information, education and communication (IEC)
 activities, fixed-­point delivery on the coverage of services
 such as vitamin A supplementation, child immunisa-
 tions and mass drug administration campaigns targeting
 neglected tropical diseases. 16 The largest positive influ-
 ence on treatment coverage was found for community-­
 directed distribution, incentives to increase distributor
 motivation, distribution along kinship networks and
 implementation of intensified IEC. The evidence avail-
 able to date suggests that interventions combining educa-
 tion with vouchers and other financial incentives tend to
 be most effective for increasing intervention coverage.
 
<section> 17–19
 The nationally recommended intervention package
 suggests iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation in
 pregnant women at a dose of 30–60 mg of elemental
 iron plus 0.4 mg of folic acid, daily and a direct observed
 therapy (DOT) of three tablets of sulfadoxine pyrimeth-
 amine (SP) (each tablet containing 500 mg/25 mg SP)
 giving the total required dosage of 1500 mg/75 mg SP
 per month.
 In this study, we report the results of a cluster
 randomised controlled trial set up to assess the efficacy
 of two potential strategies to increase coverage of the
 currently recommended interventions to the target popu-
 lation in low resource settings. The trial was conducted in
 the area of the Taabo health and demographic surveil-
 lance system (HDSS) in the south-­central part of Côte
 d’Ivoire. The interventions consisted of an information
 package (INFO), designed to increase uptake of essen-
 tial antenatal services through targeted information,
 and an information plus home delivery intervention
 (INFO+DELIV), designed to provide both information
 and immediate access to supplements and chemopro-
 phylaxis. The trial was registered at ​ClinicalTrials.​gov as
 NCT04250428 and the protocol of this trial with the anal-
 ysis plan published in 2020.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Trial design and setting
 The study was designed as a cluster randomised controlled
 trial with three parallel arms using an allocation ratio of
 1:1:1. The trial was conducted in the Taabo HDSS, which
 is located approximately 180 km north-­west of Abidjan,
 the economic capital of Côte d'Ivoire. Previous studies
 conducted in this area have highlighted the high preva-
 lence of anaemia in this setting, 22 with 61% of children
 and 48% of non-­pregnant women found to be anaemic
 in 2011. 23 For the trial, clusters were defined as neigh-
 bourhoods (‘quartier’) in villages and hamlets outside of
 the main villages. 24 All 118 clusters in the Taabo HDSS
 were initially included in the study. Pregnancies were
 reported in 90 of these clusters during the enrolment
 period. Further details pertaining to the study design
 and methods are available in the previously published
 protocol paper.
 
<section> Participants and eligibility
 The target population of the trial were pregnant women
 who were in their first or second trimester of pregnancy,
 and living in the surveillance area of the Taabo HDSS.
 Gestational length was computed based on maternal
 reports of conception dates or date of last menstrua-
 tion. Key informants living in the surveillance area were
 recruited for identifying pregnancies in their commu-
 nities and paid a reward of US$2 for each pregnancy
 reported. Trained field enumerators visited pregnant
 women and invited them to partake in the study. Condi-
 tional to women’s written informed consent, a short base-
 line questionnaire was conducted.
 
<section> Study setting
 
<section> Details on the surveillance area covered by the Taabo
 HDSS have been presented elsewhere. 21 24 Since 2012,
 the government of Côte d’Ivoire mandates free access
 to maternal and child care in public healthcare facili-
 ties, including outpatients care for mothers and children
 under the age of 5 years, family planning and prenatal
 care. Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy
 (IPTp) is also offered free of charge through a separate
 programme. When our trial was implemented, the study
 area was composed of 13 health facilities, including
 health centres and 5 dispensaries in the rural area, and a
 12-­bed hospital located in Taabo-­Cité considered as semi-
 urban.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 A total of 118 study clusters were randomly assigned to
 one of three study arms with equal probability: 39 clusters
 were randomly assigned to the control group, 39 clus-
 ters to the INFO group and 40 clusters to INFO+DELIV 
<section> group. Minimum-­maximum randomisation was used to
 minimise differences across study arms. 25 Using Stata
 15 SE software, we created 100 random allocations, and
 then computed mean differences in terms of cluster size
 (number of births) and ANC attendance (percentage of
 women attending ANC) across the three groups. We then
 selected the draw with the smallest differences across
 study arms for the final group allocation.
 Given the nature of the intervention, blinding of
 participants was not possible. However, interviewers who
 conducted the endline survey were not aware of women’s
 treatment status, and data analysis was conducted by the
 senior author (GF) using a fully blinded data set.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> During a 3-­day workshop, study nurses were trained to
 deliver key information as well as supplements. The prac-
 tice consisted of test sessions with women not eligible for
 the study. During the training, emphasis was placed on
 the delivery of awareness messages in French and local
 languages, particularly the most common Malinké and
 Baoulé languages. The message was developed based on
 the national recommendations for IFA/IPTp and ANC
 in Côte d’Ivoire. Further details on the content of the
 sessions are provided in online supplemental material
 The message was developed based on the national recom-
 mendations for IFA/IPTp and ANC in general. 20 The
 study involved a baseline and an endline survey, which
 was to be completed by all participants. In the INFO arm,
 nurses visited pregnant women at their homes 1–2 weeks
 after study enrolment. During this visit, nurses provided
 pregnant women with information regarding the impor-
 tance of antenatal IPTp as well as IFA supplementation,
 potential adverse events of both interventions and the
 optimal timing for taking supplements. Nurses also high-
 lighted the importance of using routine ANC services to
 ensure safe pregnancies. At the end of the visit, a mobile
 phone number was given to women in case they had any
 further related questions.
 In the INFO+DELIV arm, all women received the
 same initial information session at home. This first home
 visit was followed by monthly home visits, during which
 women received a monthly supply of IFA supplements
 and IPTp (starting from the second trimester) from
 study staff, unless women indicated they had already
 received supplements or chemoprophylaxis as part of the
 ANC visits. Overall, 1257 home delivery visits were made,
 which implies an average of 6 visits per woman. During
 the intervention period, every month, nurses travelled
 by motorbike throughout the study area for individual
 home deliveries of IFA and SP. The current standard of
 SP is a DOT of three tablets SP (each tablet containing
 500 mg/25 mg SP) giving the total required dosage of
 1500 mg/75 mg SP (online supplemental figure SF 1).
 IFA supplementation was implemented using locally used
 Agifer-­X capsules containing an equivalent of 100 mg of
 iron and 550 µg of folic acid (see online supplemental
 figure SF3 for packaging information).
 
<section> Detailed monitoring data on home visits were collected
 for the two arms throughout the study period. An inde-
 pendent team of laboratory technicians conducted the
 haemoglobin (Hb) assessments and administered the
 malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Hb-­level and malaria
 infection status were collected at endline within the first
 2 weeks after delivery through trained staff members
 at women’s homes. Hb was assessed using HEMOCUE
 201+devices (Hemocue; Ängelholm, Sweden). Malaria
 RDTs were conducted using CareStart Malaria Pf (HRP2)
 Ag RDTs (Access Bio; Somerset, USA) (see online supple-
 mental figure SF4 for further information).
 
<section> Study outcomes
 The primary outcomes were maternal postpartum
 anaemia and malaria parasitaemia. Postpartum anaemia
 was defined as an Hb concentration of less than 110 g/L.
 For malaria parasitaemia, the primary outcome was a
 positive RDT at endline.
 Self-­reported compliance with antenatal IFA supple-
 mentation, IPTp, as well as ANC visit, miscarriages, still-
 births and low birthweight deliveries were considered as
 secondary outcomes. Self-­reported adherence to ante-
 natal IFA supplementation and ANC attendance was
 measured using an endline-­based questionnaire deter-
 mining the number of supplements, ANC visits as well
 as the period and frequency of use. ANC attendance was
 coded as adequate if women reported to have completed
 at least four ANC visits. Compliance with IFA recom-
 mendations was coded as the (continuous) proportion
 of months (starting from the third month of gestation)
 for which mothers reported to have taken supplements
 daily (range 0–1). Compliance with malaria chemopro-
 phylaxis was coded as having taken at least three doses of
 
<section> SP during pregnancy.
 
<section> Power calculations
 With 240 women in each arm, the study was powered to
 detect a 20% difference in maternal anaemia with power
 0.8 and alpha 0.05. We assumed a control group anaemia
 prevalence of 50%, 6 women per cluster and an intraclass
 correlation of 0.25 based on a previous analysis of ANC
 access patterns in the Taabo HDSS.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 We used generalised linear regression models to assess
 intervention impact in postpartum anaemia and parasi-
 taemia, as well as for all binary secondary outcomes and
 displayed resulting estimates as prevalence ratios. Based
 on normal distribution assumptions, all continuous
 secondary outcomes (birth weight and Hb levels) were
 analysed using linear regression models. Cluster-­robust
 SEs were used to correct for residual correlation at the
 cluster level. 26 All models were estimated both without
 covariates (unadjusted) and with a prespecified set of
 mother socio-­ demographic covariates (ie, age, marital
 status, school attendance, parity and wealth quintile).
 To better understand the relationship between IFA

<section> supplementation and the observed changes in anaemia,
 we also plotted average changes in Hb levels as a func-
 tion of self-­reported intake of IFA supplements during
 pregnancy (post-­ hoc analysis). To address multiple
 testing concerns with two treatment groups and two
 outcomes, we indicate both estimates with p values<0.05
 (unadjusted significance cut-­ off) as well as estimates
 with p values<0.0125 (Family-­Wise Error Rate (FWER)-­
 corrected significance cut-­off).

<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Study population
 Study participants were recruited from 7 May 2020 to
 25 June 2021 and followed up from 10 November 2020
 to 26 November 2021. Figure 1 shows a CONSORT
 flow diagram, summarising study design and partici-
 pants retention. Overall, 118 clusters were randomly
 assigned to either control (39 clusters and 249 pregnant
 women), INFO (39 clusters and 258 pregnant women) or
 INFO+DELIV intervention (40 clusters and 260 pregnant
 women). At baseline, 767 pregnant women were enrolled
 across 91 clusters and 716 women (93.3%) were reinter-
 viewed at endline. In 27 of the original 118 clusters, no
 births were reported during the study period. No statisti-
 cally significant differences were found in follow-­up rates
 across the three study arms (p=0.90) (online supple-
 mental table ST1).
 As shown in table 1, the study participants lived
 an average of 2.2 km away from the nearest health
 facility and 69.5% (n=533) were between 20 and 34
 years of age. Mean gestational age at enrolment was
 4.1 months and the distribution was quasi-­ similar in
 the three groups (INFO=4.2, INFO+DELIV=4.1 and
 control=4.1). Slightly more than half (52.8%, n=405)
 of the women never attended school, 31.0% (n=238)
 attended primary school and 16.2% (n=124) attained
 secondary or higher education. Almost half (48.9%,
 n=375) of the women were in common-­law, while 42.4%
 (n=325) were married. Baseline Hb was collected for a
 subsample of 171 women (control=63, INFO=51 and
 INFO+DELIV=57). The overall prevalence of anaemia
 at baseline was 70.2%.

<section> Impact of intervention on primary and secondary outcomes
 Table 2 shows primary and secondary outcomes for
 each group and the sample overall. On average, across
 the three groups, 39.5% (n=283) women were anaemic;
 19.8% (n=142) were mildly anaemic (Hb, range 100 to
 <110 g/L), 18.6% (n=133) were moderately anaemic
 (Hb, range 70 to <100 g/L) and 1.1% (n=8) were severely
 anaemic (Hb<70 g/L). A positive malaria RDT was regis-
 tered in 3.4% (n=24) of the women. About one out of
 nine (11.5%, n=64) children were born with birth weight
 <2500 g. Ninety-­two per cent (n=658) of pregnancies in
 the sample resulted in live births, 3.6% (n=26) of preg-
 nancies resulted in miscarriage, 3.6% (n=26) resulted
 in stillbirths and 6 pregnancies (0.8%) were aborted. At
 least four ANC visits were recorded by 40.2% (n=291)
 of the women. More than half (54.0%, n=414) of the
 women reported compliance with daily IFA supplemen-
 tation. Almost three-­quarter (73.9%, n=513) received at
 least three doses of SP for IPTp.
 As shown in table 3, neither intervention had an
 impact on anaemia (INFO: adjusted prevalence ratio
 (aPR)=0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.19, p=0.770; INFO+DELIV:
 aPR=0.87, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.09, p=0.235). INFO+DELIV
 increased Hb marginally by 1.65 g/L (95% CI −1.08 to
 4.42) (online supplemental table ST2). Online supple-
 mental table ST3 shows more detailed results for mild,
 moderate and severe anaemia. No impact on malaria
 parasitaemia was found for INFO (aPR=0.95, 95% CI
 0.39 to 2.31, p=0.915). INFO+DELIV reduced malaria
 parasite prevalence of 83% (aPR=0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to
 
<section> 0.75, p=0.019).
 
<section> Impact on coverage and ANC attendance
 Table 4 summarises the interventions’ impact on ANC
 attendance, IFA supplementation and IPTp compliance.
 The INFO package had no impact on ANC compliance
 (aPR=1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.36, p=0.692), IFA supplemen-
 tation (aPR=2.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.46, p=0.093) and IPTp
 compliance (aPR=1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.21, p=0.728).
 INFO+DELIV increased recommended ANC attend-
 ance by 35% (aPR=1.35, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.78, p=0.037)
 and compliance with malaria chemoprophylaxis by 60%

 (aPR=1.60, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.80, p<0.001). Women in the
 INFO+DELIV group were 7.1 times as likely to comply
 with antenatal IFA supplementation (aPR=7.06, 95% CI

 CI 0.32 to 1.17, p=0.136), INFO+DELIV reduced the
 prevalence of stillbirth by 60% (aPR=0.40, 95% CI 0.21
 to 0.76, p=0.005).
 Figure 2 provides further details on IFA compliance
 per month. The proportion of women reporting daily
 intake increased from 0% in month 2 to 73% in month
 6 and from 0.4% in month 2 to a level of 73.4% in
 the 6th month of pregnancy in both the control and
 INFO groups. In the INFO+DELIV group, IFA compli-
 ance increased from 1.2% in month 2 to 93.1% in
 
<section> month
 Assessments of changes in individual Hb concen-
 tration from baseline to endline among a subsample
 of women showed that average Hb levels increased
 by 9 g/L in the control and INFO groups, and by
 g/L in the INFO+DELIV arm (online supplemental
 figure SF1). Figure 3 shows changes in Hb levels as

 among women reporting having taken supplements
 for less than 90 days was 7 g/L. Among women who
 reported to have taken supplements during 150 days

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> In this cluster randomised controlled trial, we assessed
 the effectiveness of targeted information sessions as well
 as home deliveries of supplements and chemoprophy-
 laxis as strategies to increase coverage of essential ANC
 interventions in a typical rural low-­ income setting in
 Côte d’Ivoire. Neither intervention had a major impact
 on anaemia. The INFO+DELIV greatly reduced the post-
 partum malaria parasite prevalence. Given that only 4.8%
 (Hb) levels and prevalence of anaemia. IFA, iron and folic 
<section> of women in the control group tested positive for malaria
 using an RDT in the control group, the absolute reduc-
 tions in malaria prevalence were however not very large
 (4 percentage points).
 Given that women in the INFO+DELIV group were
 seven times more likely to comply with IFA supplemen-
 tation (which seems consistent with a recent review of
 community-­ based distribution of IFA supplements,
 the lacking intervention impact on anaemia is some-
 what surprising. Earlier supplementation studies suggest
 that substantial improvements in maternal anaemia
 are feasible, in principle, with sustained intake of
 supplementation. 28–31
 Two factors might explain the relatively weak impact
 on anaemia in this study. First, supplementation was also
 relatively common in the control group of this trial, with
 an average of 112 doses (online supplemental table ST4)
 taken over the course of the pregnancy in the control
 group. Even though home deliveries increased compli-
 ance by 49 doses on average, this increase likely was not
 sufficient to lead to large reductions in anaemia. Second,
 and more importantly, our results suggest that routine
 supplementation alone is likely not sufficient to address
 the low average Hb levels in this setting. We found a
 mean Hb concentration of 95 g/L at the end of the first
 trimester (baseline), with 70.2% of women classified as
 anaemic. On average, Hb levels actually improved during
 pregnancy by 15 g/L across all groups, which is rather
 remarkable given the typically observed declines in Hb
 in between the first and third trimester due to haemo-
 dilution. 32 While we are not able to directly identify the
 aetiology and causes of anaemia in our study, previous
 evidence from the Taabo HDSS highlighted cellular iron
 deficiency as the main risk factor of anaemia among
 young women. 23 One potential strategy to address the
 high anaemia prevalence despite high IFA compliance
 would be to increase IFA dosing as part of routine ANC
 conditional on initially low levels of Hb as recommended
 by WHO. 33 Recent evidence from Tanzania also suggests
 that ferric carboxymaltose injections may offer a faster
 and more durable normalisation of Hb and ferritin
 concentrations among anaemic women. 34 Such higher
 dosing would, however, require both systematic initial Hb
 assessments and continued monitoring of pregnancies,
 which is challenging in many rural settings with often
 limited test equipment as well as limited staff.
 As for malaria parasitaemia, a coverage of 61% for three
 doses of SP in the control group appears to be better
 than in many other countries in sub-­Saharan Africa.
 Several studies presented community-­ based delivery
 of SP as a potential mean to strengthen coverage and
 uptake of IPTp 36–38 and reduce malaria parasitaemia.
 This is confirmed in our study, which shows that coverage
 rates above 95% are feasible with home deliveries. While
 the sample size of this study was too small to precisely
 estimate improvements in birth outcomes, the available
 data suggest substantial increases in the proportion of
 pregnancies resulting in live births in the INFO+DELIV
 arm (93.4% in the INFO+DELIV arm relative to 90.5%
 in the control group), with more than 50% declines in
 the proportion of pregnancies resulting in miscarriage
 and 40% reduction in the proportion of pregnancies
 resulting in stillbirths. It is not clear if these improve-
 ments are due to increased IFA supplementation,
 increased malaria chemoprophylaxis, or more frequent
 ANC visits—all three behaviours may have contributed to
 these improved outcomes, although the empirical links
 to stillbirths seem strongest for malaria infections. 40 It is
 also important to highlight that the deliveries of supple-
 ments within the study was done through trained nurses.
 Even though their primary objective was to just drop
 off the supplies, informal exchanges between pregnant
 women and study nurses were common, and likely also
 provided additional informational benefits to women in
 this arm. Larger future trials are needed to confirm these
 potentially large health benefits as well as to identify the
 main mechanisms underlying these changes.
 
<section> Limitations of this study
 The study had several limitation. First, as mentioned, our
 trial was not powered to detect changes in pregnancy
 outcomes, which hopefully can be addressed in larger
 future investigations. Second, we relied on women’s self-­
 reports for the secondary compliance measures, which
 may lead to an upward bias in the reported IFA supple-
 mentation coverage if there is a stronger social desira-
 bility bias in the intervention group. 41 Third, our malaria
 outcome only captures malaria infection status postpreg-
 nancy, which measures exposure to malaria infections
 throughout pregnancy only imperfectly. Furthermore,
 we used standard RDTs to assess infections, which are
 not yet able to detect malaria strains with HRP2 gene
 deletion. 42 This could potentially explain the relatively
 low parasite prevalence seen in this study. Our study
 also did not directly capture postpartum haemorrhage,
 which may worsen maternal anaemia post partum, 43 and
 could in part explain the high levels of anaemia despite
 supplementation in our trial. Lastly, it is possible that
 some of the information obtained during the home visits
 was shared with women from other villages, which may
 have resulted in relatively high uptake of IFA supple-
 ments in the control group. We tried to address these
 concerns through the cluster randomisation trial design,
 but cannot fully rule out some information transmission
 (even though the study team came across no evidence
 suggesting such spillovers across arms).
 
<section> CONCLUSION
 The results from this cluster randomised controlled trial
 conducted in an existing HDSS suggest that information
 plus direct home delivery of supplements can substan-
 tially improve malaria prophylaxis and IFA coverage. Our
 results also suggest that routine IFA supplementation is
 likely insufficient to address the high burden of anaemia
 in this population.
