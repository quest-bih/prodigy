<section> WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 
<section> ⇒ Studies focusing on the impact of incentives condi-
 tional on participation in education on HIV prevention
 have had mixed results, and studies with financial
 incentives contingent on negative sexually trans-
 mitted infection (STI) results showed success in re-
 ducing STI prevalence in Tanzania and reducing HIV
 incidence in Lesotho.
 
<section> ⇒ Given these mixed results and, therefore, uncertain
 policy outlook, this study was designed to test the
 impact of both types of conditional financial in-
 centives, and their combination, on HIV incidence
 among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW),
 a population at high risk for HIV infection in Eswatini.
 
<section> WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
 
<section> ⇒ The financial incentives conditional on education
 participation significantly reduced the odds of HIV
 infection among AGYW in Eswatini.
 
<section> ⇒ Raffle incentives amplified the effect since the
 strongest reduction in HIV incidence was found for
 participants eligible for both types of incentives.
 
<section> HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH,
 
<section> PRACTICE OR POLICY
 
<section> ⇒ With this study showing that HIV incidence reduc-
 tions could be on par with biomedical interventions
 like HIV treatment as prevention, the use of financial
 incentives can be a useful tool for HIV prevention
 among AGYW in other high HIV prevalence settings.
 
<section> Conclusion Financial incentives conditional on education
 participation significantly reduced HIV infection among
 adolescent girls and young women in Eswatini and appear
 to be a promising tool for prevention in high HIV prevalence
 settings.

<section> INTRODUCTION
 In 2020, Eswatini had the highest HIV prevalence
 among the general population (15–49 old) in the world
 (25.4%), 1 with women and adolescent girls and young
 women (AGYW) disproportionally infected (12.2%
 HIV prevalence among women 15–24). There are
 000 women living with HIV, which is 63% of the total
 people living with HIV in Eswatini. AGYW aged 15–24 are
 particularly at higher risk: in 2014, at study design, there
 were approximately 2400 new infections among young
 women, compared with just under 500 among young
 men.
 Income inequality in Eswatini is high, despite the
 country being classified as a lower middle-­ income
 country: in 2016, the Gini coefficient showed that Eswa-
 tini was the seventh most inequal country in the world.
 Just under 40% of Swazis were considered poor by global
 standards. 3 In 2017, only 41% of women and 66% of men
 participated in the labour force, while unemployment
 overall was 24%, unemployment among the youth aged
 19–24 was a staggering 50%. 4 The poor economic pros-
 pects, low levels of education and employment among
 AGYW result in increasing prevalence of age-­disparate
 and transactional sex. 5 Population-­based surveys showed
 that these rates among AGYW increased from 7% in 2007
 to 14% in 2010, 15% in 2014 and 16% in 2016. 6–8
 During the last decade, several studies tested the
 impact of conditional financial incentives as a strategy
 to prevent new HIV infections. 9–16 A first set focused
 on incentives conditioned on school participation and
 found mixed evidence: some showed that financial incen-
 tives may reduce HIV and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-­2
 prevalence, 9 but others using either financial incentives
 conditional on education 10 11 or multisectoral combina-
 tion interventions including cash transfers and educa-
 tion subsidies 12 13 have not demonstrated significant
 reductions in HV incidence. A Cochrane review in 2017
 recommended that more studies of education incen-
 tives were needed. 14 Another set of studies evaluated the
 impact of financial incentives conditioned on remaining
 negative for curable STIs. 15 16 In Tanzania, such incen-
 tives were found to significantly reduce STI prevalence,
 while in Lesotho lottery-­ based financial incentives
 significantly reduced HIV incidence. 16 Given the mixed
 results suggesting equipoise, more evidence is needed
 on the efficiency of financial incentives for HIV preven-
 tion. With a 2×2 factorial design, the Sitakhela Likusasa
 Impact Evaluation was designed to test the hypothesis
 that incentives conditional on school attendance, raffle
 incentives conditional on remaining STI free, and their
 combination, would reduce HIV incidence measured at
 the individual level in a sample of AGYW who were in and
 out-­of-­school in both rural and urban settings in Eswatini.
 The cluster randomisation was used for education incen-
 tives to avoid contamination across participants attending
 the same school. Sitakhela Likusasa is a Siswati phrase
 meaning ‘we build the future.’
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Trial design
 
<section> The study, a cluster randomised trial, comprised
 clusters—30% urban clusters and 70% rural clusters—in
 Eswatini. 17 A cluster was defined as a census enumera-
 tion area (EA) in Eswatini. There were 2076 EAs defined
 in the last census in 2007, and the average number of
 households per area was 103 (274 for rural EAs and 34
 for urban EAs). To guarantee that AGYW living in the
 same area and, in particular, around the same school had
 access to the same education incentives and to, there-
 fore, avoid contamination, participants’ access to finan-
 cial incentives conditional on education attendance were
 randomly allocated, using stratified random sampling, at
 the cluster level.
 After enrolment into the study, participants were
 further individually randomised to have access to a raffle
 incentive or not. Those eligible for the raffle incentive
 would receive a prize if they satisfied all of the three
 following conditions: random selection into the raffle for
 that round, testing negative on negative tests for syph-
 ilis and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and on being a raffle
 winner, creating four subarms in a 2×2 factorial design:
 no intervention subarm, raffle incentive subarm, educa-
 tion incentive subarm and raffle and education incentive
 subarm, as per study protocol. 18 Treatment and control
 groups for the raffle incentive and education incentive
 were created, as follows: education treatment arm was
 the education incentive subarm and education and raffle
 subarm; education control arm was the raffle subarm and
 no intervention subarm; raffle treatment arm was the
 education and raffle subarm and the raffle subarm and
 raffle control arm was the education incentive subarm
 and no intervention subarm.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> Enrolling participants into the study and allocating them
 to one of the four study subarms was a five-­step process,
 detailed in the randomisation section of this paper.
 Participants were randomly selected from a filtered set
 of EAs in Eswatini that met these criteria: (1) EAs that
 were not part of, or adjacent to, another impact evalu-
 ation focusing on unconditional incentives for orphans
 and vulnerable children that was taking place at the time
 in four local government areas in Eswatini and (2) EAs
 that had a population of 200 or higher (based on the
 2007 census data, the latest available at the time).
 Participants were offered enrolment into the study if
 they met these criteria: HIV-­negative AGYW aged 15–22 at
 the time of enrolment were enrolled as study participants
 if they further met three eligibility criteria: willingness to
 go back to some form of education, not planning to leave

 resident. A list of eligible girls and young women was
 drawn from census data and confirmed with community
 leaders, creating two lists: one of in-­school and another

<section> Interventions
 Financial incentives conditional on education attendance
 In the education treatment arm, participants were
 eligible for financial incentives when enrolling in school
 (at the beginning of each school year) or starting the
 tertiary education (university) year, starting a short
 course, starting a course at a technical college or voca-
 tional training, or taking up upgrading classes. Partici-
 pants were also eligible for an additional incentive if they
 had at least 80% attendance during the school term.
 Participants in university, college, upgrading classes or
 in a short course received an additional incentive if they
 completed the course or a particular year. The exact
 conditionalities for the education incentive payments,
 the commensurate incentive amounts and the 2×2 facto-
 rial design are further detailed in tables 1 and 2. School
 enrolment and attendance were verified using Ministry
 of Education enrolment and attendance register data
 from the schools (registers were requested from entire
 grades, so as to avoid individual study participants being
 identified). The study team extracted school enrol-
 ment and school attendance data from these registers
 and made payments using MTN (Mobile Telecommu-
 nication Network) Mobile Money system once a term,
 within 3 months of the school-­term ending. Enrolment
 in upgrading classes, vocational training, university or
 a short course—as well as completion of these types of
 education—was verified through letters from the respec-
 tive institutions. Payment was made to study participants
 directly using MTN Mobile Money within 3 months of

<section> the proof being sent from the school directly to the
 study team. Participants who did not have access to (or
 were too young for) the MTN Mobile Money electronic
 payment system were paid using the local post office’s
 fund transfer process.
 Due to initial challenges in verifying school atten-
 dance, the payment of education incentives started slowly
 in the first year. This issue led to extending study imple-
 mentation period by 1 year and to reinforcing the educa-
 tion incentives during the last year as detailed in table
 The reinforcement of the education incentives entailed
 paying, in the latter half of the study, an additional incen-
 tive to participants who were in the education treat-
 ment arm and who were out of school at midline data
 collection.
 
<section> Raffle incentives conditional on testing negative for syphilis and TV
 In the raffle incentive treatment arm, the intervention
 took place as follows (for details, see tables 1 and 2): some
 participants (randomly selected at each raffle round)
 were enrolled in a raffle conditional on testing negative
 for syphilis and TV. Those two curable STIs were selected
 based on their known prevalence in Eswatini and neigh-
 bouring KwaZulu Natal at the time of study design. 19
 Seven rounds of raffle took place over the course of the
 study. At each raffle draw, participants in the raffle incen-
 tive treatment arm were randomly selected (n=200 at
 each round) for STI screening. Those who tested nega-
 tive for TV and Syphilis were then entered in a raffle draw
 through which n=80 winners per round were randomly
 selected to receive a prize of E1 000 (~ US$72). Free
 medical treatment was offered to those who tested posi-
 tive for either STI; post-­treatment, those who tested nega-
 tive were eligible for future raffle incentives.
 To minimise attrition in all study groups, a study help-
 desk was established and tasked with regularly updating

<section> Outcomes
 
<section> This study was designed to evaluate the impact of incen-
 tives conditional on school attendance, raffle incentives
 conditional on remaining STI free and their combi-
 nation, on HIV incidence measured at the individual
 level over 3 years (November 2015–March 2016 until
 
<section> November 2018–April 2019).
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> Sample size for the treatment arm was calculated with the
 Hayes and Bennet approach, 21 using equations derived
 from cluster-­randomised trials and confirmed using the
 cluster sampsi programme in Stata V.12.0. Assuming
 a lower HIV incidence rate due to the younger age of
 participants than observed in the 2011 Swaziland HIV
 Incidence Measurement Survey (SHIMS), the study
 protocol, assuming the coefficient of variation k=0.25,
 estimated 5% HIV incidence rate after 2 years, with a 30%
 reduction in the treatment arm, requiring at least 83 clus-
 ters of 20 participants in each arm followed for 2 years, or
 
<section> 1660 per arm, for a total of 3320 participants. The sample
 size was increased by 10% per year or 19% over 2 years to
 account for attrition. Thus, the study aimed to recruit a 
<section> minimum of 3950 participants from 250 clusters (80% of
 these clusters were rural and 20% were urban, with 50%
 of participants being in-­school at the time of enrolment,
 and 50% out of school at the time of enrolment into the
 study).
 In the interest of efficiency, the sample size calculation
 assumed that there was no interaction between the inter-
 ventions. Few studies have examined this question, and,
 therefore, there is little certainty for this assumption.
 Without a considerable increase in sample size, the test
 of interaction is likely to be underpowered; however, as
 our primary interest was the main effects of each inter-
 vention, the study aimed to provide adequate power for
 the primary evaluations.
 
<section> Randomisation
 Randomisation entailed the following steps:
 a) For the incentives conditional on education attendance
 First, at the cluster level, 50% of EAs were randomly allo-
 cated in Stata to the education incentive control arm and
 50% to the education incentive treatment arm, stratified
 by rural and urban (70% and 30%, respectively).
 Second, after selection of EAs into the study and to the
 education incentive treatment or control arms, EA selec-
 tion validation was done to minimise the risk of contam-
 ination. In particular, geospatial analytics was used to
 determine which control and treatment EAs were adja-
 cent to each other, creating an ‘adjacent EA pair’. For
 each of these ‘adjacent EA pairs’, simple random selec-
 tion determined which of the EAs in the ‘adjacent EA
 pair’ should be replaced. The EA in the adjacent pair
 selected for replacement was replaced with another EA
 (randomly selected) from the sample frame (ensuring
 that a rural EA replaces a rural EA and an urban EA
 
<section> Figure 1 
<section> Flowchart: EA filtering and randomisation. EA, enumeration
 replaces an urban EA). After this was done, adjacency had
 to be checked again as the newly selected EA could cause
 adjacency issues with other EAs. The selection validation
 process was repeated four times until no education treat-
 ment EA or education control EAs were adjacent to each
 other.
 Third, during enrolment into the study, the study
 team aimed to enrol at least 12 participants per EA,
 of which six had to be in school at the time of enrol-
 ment in the study, and six were out of school at the
 time of study enrolment. In some of the original
 randomised EAs, it was not possible to enrol 12 partici-
 pants per cluster. In 132 EAs, no AGYW could be found
 who were eligible and agreed to be enrolled in the
 study. These 132 EAs were dropped and 132 new EAs
 were selected from the sample population of eligible
 EAs, following the same adjacency checking process as
 
<section> described in step
 Fourth, after participant enrolment in the 132 new EAs
 was completed, the minimum sample size still had not
 yet been reached. To accommodate the dropped 132 EAs
 and the additional EAs needed to ensure that the partici-
 pant enrolment targets were met, in total, 177 additional
 EAs were selected, following the process described in step
 3—totaling 295 EAs. After enrolment into baseline data
 collection, two EAs were dropped because baseline data
 were not collected from any participants in those EAs.
 Eventually, after baseline data collection was completed,
 participants from 293 EAs (148 education treatment EAs
 and 145 education control EAs) were enrolled in the
 study. Endline data were collected from 292 EAs (one EA
 was not part of endline data collection because all partic-
 ipants in that EA either dropped out of the study or were
 loss to follow-­up during endline data collection). See
 
<section> area. 
<section> figure 1 describing the cluster level filtering and rando-
 misation process.
 At the individual level, a random sample of girls and
 young women from the lists of in-­school and out-­of-­school
 AGYW was selected and invited to participate in the study.
 In EAs where it was not possible to enrol 12 participants
 per cluster, additional EAs were selected from either the
 treatment or control list of oversampled EAs. The same
 ‘EA adjacent criterion’ described in step 4 above was
 followed to ensure that no control or treatment EAs were
 adjacent to each other. Eventually, participants from
 EAs were enrolled in the study. Average cluster size was
 20 participants (maximum 42).
 All randomisation procedures for the education incen-
 tives were computer implemented by the study statisti-
 cian in Stata.
 
<section> b) For the raffle incentives conditional on testing negative for
 
<section> syphilis and TV
 
<section> This individual randomisation was facilitated by the study
 staff at the time of study enrolment: participants were
 asked to draw a ball from a closed bag with four blue and
 four red balls in it—blue signalled raffle enrolment and
 red signalled no raffle enrolment.
 
<section> Allocation concealment mechanism and blinding
 Due to the nature of the interventions relying on
 incentives, there was no masking of intervention status
 to the recipients either at the cluster or the individual
 level. Data capturers determining a participant’s school
 attendance every quarter, data collectors administering
 the education status and behavioural questionnaire and
 counsellors providing HIV testing at study data collection
 points at baseline, midline and endline, were blinded to a
 participant’s assignment to a study subarm.
 
<section> Statistical methods
 Recruitment and data collection
 The study took place from November 2015 until April
 2019. Participants were enrolled into the study between
 November 2015 and March 2016. Due to delayed imple-
 mentation in the first year, the impact evaluation was
 extended for a third year after obtaining IRB clearance
 to do so. Therefore, participants who consented to being
 part of the third year of implementation were followed
 up over 3 years. All study participants were tested for HIV
 prior to enrolment and at different timepoints in the
 study. More specifically, testing, screening and surveys
 were conducted at baseline (November 2015 to March
 2016), midline (November 2017 to March 2018) and
 endline (November 2018 to April 2019) to determine
 HIV, syphilis and TV status and elicit information on
 education status, household characteristics, sexual and
 dating behaviour, employment status, levels of knowl-
 edge, risk-­taking behaviour, access to other programmes,
 gender-­ based violence incidence and related informa-
 tion. Raffle participation and education participation
 data were also collected from intervention data and
 school registers, respectively.
 
<section> Data analysis
 
<section> Stata V.15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) was used
 to analyse the data on an intention-­to-­treat (ITT) basis.
 Loss to follow-­up included participants who refused, with-
 drew, were reported to be deceased or out of Eswatini
 or could not be contacted/traced. Absolute measures of
 HIV incidence, defined as seroconversion between base-
 line and endline, were calculated for each study group
 and categorical variables. Random effects logistic regres-
 sion models with EA as a cluster were used to estimate
 unadjusted and adjusted ORs. In online supplemental
 table S1, we also fit generalised linear models to express
 the main intervention effects as risk ratios and inci-
 dence rate ratios. Adjusted regression models controlled
 for the following baseline variables: schooling status
 at baseline; rural/urban locality; region of residence;
 highest schooling level attained; participant age; asset-­
 based social economic status 23 and risk behaviour pref-
 erence 16 24 as measured at endline were also estimated.
 Cluster robust SEs were computed.
 
<section> Sensitivity analysis
 Sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the missing
 at random (MAR) assumption using pattern-­ mixture
 multiple imputation model approach was conducted,
 see online supplemental figure S1 and table S2. The
 analysis showed nearly identical results with no change
 in interpretation of the MAR analytical results, and, thus,
 only the MAR results from complete case analyses are
 reported.
 
<section> Ethics
 
<section> All potential participants and their legal guardians (for
 minor adolescent girls) were informed of the purpose
 of the study, the outcomes and process, and the confi-
 dentiality of their responses. They received an informa-
 tion sheet detailing the risks and benefits of enrolment
 and were then invited to participate in the study, and
 their informed consent was sought. All participants
 could refuse to participate or leave the study at any time.
 Communities were sensitised to the study via public and
 radio announcements. Guardians were not informed of
 HIV testing for minors as the age of consent for testing in
 Eswatini is 12 years. This was implemented to minimise
 the chance that guardians would be able to deduce that
 the minor was excluded due to their HIV status for those
 minors who do not wish to disclose their status to their
 guardians.
 HIV-­positive participants were referred for HIV care at
 baseline and during the study, and follow-­up was done
 with all positive participants to assess levels of uptake of
 linkage to care. STI treatment was offered for the partic-
 ipant and her sexual partner. In the raffle incentive
 treatment group, every STI-­positive participant was also 
<section> retested 2 weeks after treatment and if STI negative, she
 was eligible for the next raffle round.
 
<section> Patient and public involvement
 This study was launched after extensive discussions with
 HIV stakeholders in the country including the Ministry of
 Health, Ministry of Education and Training, the Office of
 the Deputy Prime Minister that coordinates programmes
 for and help with orphans and vulnerable children
 and the Department of social welfare, the Ministry of
 Tinkhundla Administration and Development, NERCHA,
 Central Statistics Office and civil society organisations
 supporting and representing youth groups, UN agencies,
 other researchers working on HIV in the country, and
 other development partners—to determine the most
 pertinent research questions, implementation modali-
 ties and focus of the study. The study further involved
 traditional leaders and local leaders in all four regions
 of Eswatini to ensure that the study was well understood
 and that their concerns were taken into account. More-
 over, the study team obtained feedback from and held
 conversations with parents, teachers and school adminis-
 tration staff and the regional education officers to both
 understand the challenges in school access, what can be
 done to address it and how to best implement the study
 in ways that would be perceived as fair by the parents
 and teachers. The survey questionnaires were piloted
 with typical study participants to improve the wording of
 the questions in the local language. Prior to designing
 the research, the study team also conducted qualitative
 research using ethnography methods to understand the
 range and type of sexual relationships and behaviours
 in the country and how people in local vernacular refer
 to them. During the study, a helpdesk was established
 to ensure that study participants had access to the study
 team for any questions or concerns. During the time of
 recruitment of study participants, posters about the study
 were put up in public places in the community and infor-
 mation shared with local leaders, including about the
 study sites and their purpose. Study progress and results
 were also shared with these stakeholders.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Participant flow
 Due to a lower number of participants enrolling in the
 study per cluster than assumed during the study design,
 a total of 293 clusters were eventually included in the
 study: 148 education incentive treatment clusters and
 145 education incentive control clusters, enrolling 4389
 participants. From 4389 recruited participants, 2159 were
 in 148 randomly selected clusters eligible for the educa-
 tion incentive. Individual randomisation for the raffle
 incentive distributed participants into four subarms: no
 intervention (n=1068), raffle incentive (n=1162), educa-
 tion incentive (n=1088) and raffle and education incen-
 tive (n=1071). There was no opportunity to enrol after
 baseline. Midline participation rates were 84.2% overall
 
<section> (3695/4389), 81.1% in the no-­intervention group, 86.1%
 in the raffle incentive group, 85.6% in the education
 incentive group and 83.8% in the raffle and education
 incentive group. Endline participation rates were 86.3%
 overall (3786/4389), 85.1% in the no-­intervention group,
 85.6% in the raffle incentive group, 87% in the education
 incentive group and 87.3% in the raffle and education
 incentive group (see participant flow in figure 2). Four-
 teen endline participants did not have HIV test results
 that is, 14/3786=0.37%.
 The differential loss-­ to-­ follow-­ up was not statistically
 significant, p=0.085. Sensitivity analysis assessing the MAR
 assumption in the ITT complete case analysis at endline
 showed that estimates were almost identical and, thus,
 there were little to no effect of attrition on estimates, see
 online supplemental table S2.
 
<section> Baseline data
 
<section> Table 3 shows that there were no statistically signifi-
 cant differences between the education treatment and
 education control arms at baseline and endline on the
 following variables: schooling status at baseline, urban/
 rural locality, baseline highest education level and age at
 enrolment and attitudes towards risk, while differences
 were observed by region and for baseline wealth quin-
 tiles using an asset-­based measure. 17 The proportion of
 enrolled participants from each region was retained at
 endline.
 
<section> Intervention exposure
 Fifty nine per cent (1274/2159) of all participants in the
 education treatment arm received at least one incentive
 payment during the implementation period. Across all
 rounds, education incentive payment varied between
 88% and 100% of all participants whose school partici-
 pants had been verified. The proportion of participants
 verified and paid was higher in calendar year 2018 (98%–
 100%) compared with calendar years 2016 and 2017
 (88%–99%). The primary reason for non-­ payment of
 verified participants was due to non-­contact, see Table S3.
 Raffle payments for participants who were randomly
 sampled, tested negative for TV and syphilis, and selected
 for a raffle prize, was between 95.0% and 98.7%. Non-­
 payment to the raffle ‘winners’ was due to non-­contact
 of raffle ‘winners’ after a negative STI test, see Table S4.
 
<section> Outcomes and estimation: HIV incidence
 At endline, 272 participants from 3772 analysed had sero-
 converted to HIV.
 
<section> HIV incidence in education incentive control arm: HIV
 incidence among participants in the education incentive
 control arm over 3 years averages to about 2.7% per year,
 or 8.1% over the study period (see table 4).
 
<section> HIV incidence by education incentive treatment arm:
 across the study period, HIV incidence among partic-
 ipants in the education incentive treatment arm was
 6.3%, statistically significantly lower than among those
 in the education incentive control arm (8.1%), p=0.039.

 had 23.4% lower odds of acquiring HIV over the study
 period compared with those in the education incen-

 After adjusting for other key variables, participants in the
 education incentive treatment arm had a 24.6% lower
 odds of HIV infection (aOR: 0.754 (0.585 to 0.972),
 p=0.029) (see table 4).
 
<section> HIV incidence by raffle treatment arm: although not
 significant at the 5% level, HIV incidence was lower in
 the raffle incentive arm compared with those in the raffle
 control arm, 6.61% versus 7.83%, p=0.086. Participants
 in the raffle incentive arm had 17.3% lower odds of
 acquiring HIV compared with those in the raffle control
 arm (OR: 0.827 (95% CI 0.645 to 1.060), p=0.133).
 The unadjusted and adjusted odds of acquiring HIV
 was lower for participants in any of the three subarms
 compared with those in the no intervention subarm.
 Those in the education incentive and raffle subarm had
 36.6% lower chance of acquiring HIV over the imple-
 mentation period compared with those in the no-­inter-
 vention subarm (OR: 0.634 (0.443 to 0.907), p=0.013),

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> The Sitakhela Likusasa study is a rigorous cluster
 randomised control trial to evaluate financial incentives
 conditional on education attendance and raffle incen-
 tives conditional on remaining STI negative. The find-
 ings indicate that financial incentives conditional on
 education participation significantly reduced the odds
 of acquiring HIV infection among AGYW in Eswatini by
 24.6%. While raffle incentives on their own did not lead
 to a statistically significant reduction in HIV incidence,
 the combination of raffle and education incentives statis-
 tically significantly reduced the odds of acquiring HIV
 infection by 37.8%.
 Not only these are significant reductions in the odds of
 acquiring HIV, but the study was implemented (a) in a
 public sector education system and (b) managed to enrol
 and incentivise even study participants who were out of

 The measure of risk preference (‘Risk lover attitude’) was constructed as an indicator variable taking value 0 for respondents who preferred a fixed
 amount of money below or equal to the expected value (of 250 Emalangani) instead of a lottery with 50% chance of winning 500 Emalangani, and
 1 otherwise. The asset-­based socio-­economic status measure is based on four questions: access to electricity, access to water in own dwelling,
 ownership of a car or truck and whether the household experienced problems in satisfying the food needs of the household. The answers to those
 questions were used to create an index—later divided in five quintiles, using principal component analysis, following Vyas and Kumaranayake.

 to engage in other alternative forms of learning.
 The results among the study population are represen-
 tative of the AGYW population in Eswatini, writ large,
 because of three reasons. (a) the HIV incidence in the
 education incentive control group was comparable to
 the HIV incidence among women 15–24 in Eswatini
 measured through a population-­ based biobehavioural
 survey in 2015/2016 (at the same time as enrolment into
 
<section> BMJ Global Health
 
<section> Sitakhela Likusasa study), namely, the second SHIMS;
 (b) the HIV incidence of 2.7% in the education incentive
 control arm is within the 95% CI limits of the SHIMS2
 estimate, 26 suggesting that the study population is compa-
 rable to the Eswatini population; (c) with 30% of partic-
 ipants from urban areas and 70% from rural areas, the
 study sample reflected the distribution of the population
 of Eswatini.

<section> BMJ Global Health 
<section> The Sitakhela Likusasa results are consistent with a
 study conducted in Malawi 9 that showed that cash trans-
 fers conditional on education participation reduced HIV
 prevalence, but they stand in contrast with the results of
 the CAPRISA 10 and HPTN068 11 studies, both of which
 also tested financial incentives conditional on schooling
 but reported a lack of statistically significant impact
 among their study populations. A key difference between
 these two studies and Sitakhela Likusasa is that in these
 two studies, most study participants were AGYW already
 in school and living in urban areas while the Sitakhela
 Likusasa study enrolled 50% of AGYW who were out-­
 of-­school at baseline, following the hypothesis that they
 would be more at risk and also potentially more likely to
 change their behaviour in response to incentives.
 These results are an important contribution to the
 ongoing debate about the relevance of structural and
 social programmes for HIV prevention. To date, the
 impact of structural interventions (ie, interventions that
 address social determinants of HIV infection, or what is
 termed ‘social vaccine’-type initiatives including financial
 incentives for HIV prevention) has yielded mixed results
 in terms of its impact on HIV infection prevention.
 According to Baum et al, a term ‘social vaccine’ in the
 context of public health efforts was coined to ‘encourage
 the biomedically orientated health sector to recognise
 the legitimacy of action on the distal social and economic
 determinants of health’. 28 The potential of structural
 HIV prevention programmes (like secondary education
 programmes) as a ‘social vaccine’ has been postulated
 numerous times 29 30 and shown in natural experiments
 to be effective (such as an estimated 8.1 percentage
 point decrease in HIV prevalence for every added year of
 schooling in Botswana). 31 But, experimental evidence has
 been scarce, sometimes because of limitations in study
 design: interventions were tested using self-­ reported
 behavioural outcomes and not HIV incidence, and some
 were small-­scale evaluations without sufficient power to
 detect a statistically significant result.
 In this regard, Sitakhela Likusasa aimed to provide
 rigorous evidence about the potential of a structural
 intervention to be a ‘social vaccine’ for HIV prevention.
 For a structural intervention to be deemed as a ‘social
 vaccine’, it would require that such an intervention has
 experimental results with a similar effect size to that of
 a biomedical intervention. Contrasting the effect sizes
 in the Sitakhela Likusasa results with studies evaluating
 universal (HIV) test-­and-­treat strategies (UTT)—which
 put persons on HIV treatment immediately on an HIV-­
 positive diagnosis—provides such a comparison. Out of
 five UTT trials, two studies 32 33 showed a reduction in HIV
 incidence, 34 with effect sizes around 30%, comparable to
 Sitakhela Likusasa. This shows that ‘social vaccine’-type
 HIV prevention programmes (such as the interventions
 evaluated in Sitakhela Likusasa) that also address other,
 wider human capital challenges (education drop out and
 incompletion), can have an effect of similar magnitude
 to that of biomedical/drug-­based HIV prevention strate-
 gies like test-­and-­treat.
 The following study limitations should be considered
 in interpreting the results: attrition, especially for the
 no-­intervention group, and difficulties in verifying school
 attendance on a regular basis were identified at the outset
 as potential study limitations. The attrition challenge was
 satisfactorily addressed by the establishment of a study
 helpdesk tasked with regularly updating contact details
 of all participants. Due to challenges in verifying school
 attendance, the payment of education incentives started
 slowly in the first year. For that reason, the study imple-
 mentation period was extended by 1 year. The education
 incentives were reinforced during the last year. A further
 limitation of the study is the lack of power to detect
 differences in effects between study subarms. While this
 study was conducted at a relatively large scale for Eswatini
 and with direct involvement of the Government of Eswa-
 tini, some of the interventions were supported outside
 the national administrative system and externally funded,
 raising issues about scalability and sustainability. In partic-
 ular, the programmatic implementation of regular raffle
 incentives might be challenging to scale-­up, even though
 our design which randomly selected the participants
 taking part in each raffle round minimised the testing
 costs. The findings reported in this paper focused solely
 on the impact of the intervention on HIV incidence and
 did not account for potential health and education bene-
 fits of the intervention (which might have been suffi-
 cient to justify the implementation of such a safety net
 supporting human capital challenges among AGYW in
 Eswatini, regardless of the HIV outcome).
 
<section> CONCLUSIONS
 The study results have shown that financially empow-
 ering AGYW likely gave them more opportunities to
 decline risky sexual encounters and incentivising them
 to attend school offered them productive occupations
 and long-­term aspirations. Keeping AGYW in education
 significantly reduces HIV incidence and is essential for
 the HIV response in contexts like Eswatini with high HIV
 prevalence and elevated risk among AGYW; the added
 benefit of this intervention is not just that it is a social
 and behavioural intervention requiring no medication to
 be successful but also that it has benefits far beyond the
 health benefit alone. Promoting access to and comple-
 tion of more years of schooling is a critical component to
 forming human capital in Eswatini and more generally
 in all low and middle-­income countries. 35 While finan-
 cial incentives and other behavioural interventions have
 shown mixed results in HIV prevention, the use of finan-
 cial incentives for education appears to be promising tool
 to reduce HIV incidence and achieve better education,
 health and opportunities for AGYW in Eswatini and other
 high HIV prevalence settings.
 The absence of statistically significant effect of the raffle
 incentives on their own could potentially be explained by
 the fact that their salience might have been eclipsed by the 
<section> education incentives. However, raffle incentives amplified
 the education incentives’ effect since the strongest reduc-
 tion in HIV incidence was found for participants eligible for
 both types of incentives. While the study was not powered
 to detect differences across subarms, together with previous
 results from Lesotho, 16 this suggests that raffle or lottery-­
 based incentives conditional on being STI negative should
 be further explored as a prevention tool for HIV in combi-
 nation with education incentives.
 The study results have shown that an incentivised
 behavioural intervention can work at scale in a context
 such as Eswatini where HIV incidence among AGYW
 and the high school dropout rate are both very high. In
 contexts with hyperendemic HIV epidemics and high
 HIV incidence among AGYW, this study has shown that
 behavioural interventions remain an important tool for
 HIV prevention strategies for the AGYW population.

 invaluable help in ensuring the study team’s access to schools to collect the
 necessary class attendance records. Thanks are also due to Edwin Simelane from
 UNESCO who provided ongoing support and assisted the Ministry of Education
 and Training team involved in the study. The authors would like to thank the
 head teachers (principals) of schools that study participants were enrolled at.
 The authors wish to thank the team at SWAGAA (Swaziland Action Group Against
 Abuse), in particular Cebile Manzini-­Henwood and Gcinaphi Ndlovu, who provided
 inputs to the gender-­based violence aspects of the study questionnaires, and
 who provided counselling to any study participants who sought their assistance.
 The authors would like to thank the team at the National Research Laboratory
 (Swaziland Health Laboratory Services, as part of the Ministry of Health) that
 provided technical advice to ensure adherence to the country’s sexually transmitted
 infection guidelines and HIV testing protocols, conducted quality assurance
 in relation to the HIV and STI testing aspects of the study, and that performed
 confirmatory Trichomonas vaginalis testing (using the Cepheid Xpert TV test) during
 endline data collection. The authors wish to acknowledge the support of Cepheid
 for providing the Trichomonas vaginalis confirmatory test kits (Xpert TV) and
 trained the Swaziland Health Laboratory Services staff in how to use these tests
 on the GeneXpert platform. The authors acknowledge the support of the Lancet
 Laboratories in Eswatini that conducted the Trichomonas vaginalis confirmatory
 testing during the raffle rounds and midline data collection. The authors would also
 like to thank the institutions and individuals involved in managing the payments to
 study participants, in particular the team at the Institute for Health Measurement
 Southern Africa (IHM), supported by Nontobeko Fakudze, Melusi Sacolo, Mbongeni
 Dube, and members of the Sitakhela Likusasa Study Implementation Help Desk
 (Thobile Ndzabandzaba and Lindelwa Hlophe), all under the leadership of the CEO,
 Kelvin Sikwibele. The authors also thank the teams of field workers and the team
 of nurses who undertook the biomedical testing, the counsellors who provided HIV
 testing and counselling support, the research assistants who interviewed the study
 participants in the field, and the drivers who transported them. Acknowledgement
 is due to the team from Enhancing Care Foundation (ECF) led by Dr Sandy Pillay,
 and to Janan Dietrich, Gugulethu Tshabalala and Mamakiri Mulaudzi at the Bio-­
 Behavioural Research Division of the Perinatal HIV Research Unit (PHRU), a division
 of the Wits Health Consortium, who were both contracted by the World Bank to
 code and analyze the qualitative data collected for the Sitakhela Likusasa Impact
 Evaluation’s Qualitative Research component. The authors would like to thank the
 wider team at the National Emergency Response Council on HIV/AIDS in Eswatini
 (NERCHA), namely Futhi Dennis (who led from NERHCA’s side the study design
 and implementation before leaving for postgraduate studies), as well as Bheka
 Mziyako, Nsindiso Dlamini and Bongani Dube. The authors want to thank the World
 Bank team initially involved in different stages of the study: (a) the study’s first
 co-­Principal Investigator who was involved in the study conceptualisation and
 design and who left for an academic position before the study started to enrol
 participants, Dr Andrea Low, (b) World Bank staff involved in study design, Pandu
 Harimurti and Emiko Masaki, (c) World Bank staff providing support to the study’s
 implementation and analyses (Susan Sebastian, Silu Feng, Nigel Herath, Jasmine
 Vicencio, Laura Ruiz, and Tommy Wilkinson), and (d) consultant to the World Bank,
 Dr Audrey Pettifor, who consulted on the design and analysis of the qualitative
 research component of the study. Finally, and most importantly, the authors thank
 all the study participants who consented and their parents who assented to their
 involvement in the Sitakhela Likusasa Impact Evaluation, for their willingness to
 participate in the Sitakhela Likusasa Impact Evaluation. All the study partners
 appreciate the willingness of every individual participant who contributed to this
 important research and greatly value their participation and readiness to share
 personal experiences and information. The authors have written a reflexivity
