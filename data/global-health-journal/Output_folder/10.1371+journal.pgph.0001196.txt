<section> Abstract
 
<section> Reporting of HIV self-test results to encourage linkage to HIV care for those who receive a
 positive test result is a common challenge faced by HIV self-testing programs. The impact
 self-testing programs is diminished if individuals who obtain a self-test do not use the test
 seek confirmatory testing and initiate HIV treatment following a positive result. We con-
 ducted a cluster randomized trial of two interventions designed to increase reporting of HIV
 self-test results: a “plan and commit” intervention that leveraged insights from behavioral
 economics, and an enhanced usual care version of the standard HIV self-test community
 distribution protocol that promoted the importance of reporting results. The trial was con-
 ducted at community distribution sites for HIV self-tests in Tshwane Metropolitan Municipal-
 ity, Gauteng Province, South Africa. The primary outcome was reporting of self-test results
 via a WhatsApp messaging system. We recruited 1,478 participants at 13 distribution sites
 over 24 days. In the plan and commit condition, 63/731 participants (8.7%) reported their
 test results via WhatsApp, compared to 59/747 participants (7.9%) in the enhanced usual
 care condition (n.s., p = 0.61). During the study period, 101/3,199 individuals (3.1%) who
 received a self-test under the standard protocol reported test results via WhatsApp, a signifi-
 cant difference across the three arms (p < .00001). Our results suggest that boosting the
 reporting of self-test results can be done solely through increasing the salience of the impor-
 tance of reporting and a clear explanation of the procedure for reporting results.

<section> Competing interests: The authors have declared

<section> people living with HIV (PLHIV) and linking them to HIV care has proven challenging [2]. To
 increase testing coverage among hard-to-reach individuals at high risk of HIV infection, HIV
 self-testing (HIVST) has been widely used in recent years. Private and convenient, HIVST
 offers advantages over other testing modalities and can overcome barriers to testing for prior-
 ity populations who may be less likely to seek facility-based approaches [3,4]. The World
 Health Organization’s HIV testing guidelines recommend the scale-up of HIVST. In southern
 Africa, the STAR (Self-Test Africa) initiative, supported by UNITAID, has distributed over
 700,000 self-tests to date.
 Despite scale-up of this promising approach, behavioral barriers to self-test use and post-
 test results reporting linkage to care limit the effectiveness of HIVST [5]. The impact of HIVST
 programs is diminished if individuals pick up self-tests at distribution sites, but do not subse-
 quently use the test or seek confirmatory testing following a positive self-test result. While
 picking up a self-test at a community distribution site suggests an intention to use the test and
 seek appropriate health care, following up on those intentions may be challenging due to sev-
 eral behavioral factors. These include procrastination stemming from present-biased decision-
 making, competing priorities, hassle factors, fear of obtaining a positive test result, and stigma
 associated with seeking care. Similar to many other screening and prevention behaviors, there
 can be a large gap between intention and action in HIVST use and linkage decisions.
 Behavioral economics research suggests several low-cost interventions that can encourage
 individuals to follow through on their intentions to engage in specific health behaviors. Plan-
 ning prompts, which prompt individuals to make a plan for undertaking a behavior, have
 shown promise in closing the intention-action gap for diverse actions including voting [6],
 influenza vaccination [7] and HIV testing [8]. Planning prompts encourage behavioral
 rehearsal and facilitate the formation of specific implementation intentions [9–12]. Addition-
 ally, commitment devices, even when the commitment is private and unenforceable, leverage
 people’s intrinsic desire to maintain a consistent self-image and follow what they perceive to
 be the descriptive and injunctive norm [13]. Planning prompts and commitment devices are
 effective strategies for translating behavioral intentions into actions, particularly when barriers
 to the desired behavior include procrastination, prospective memory failures, and hassle fac-
 tors. In this pragmatic randomized trial, we assessed the effectiveness of a simple planning
 prompt and commitment device for increasing reporting of HIV self-test results by individuals
 who obtained self-tests at community distribution sites in South Africa.
 
<section> Materials and methods
 
<section> Ethics statement
 
<section> The STAR program was approved by the University of Witwatersrand. The study was
 approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board. A waiver of informed
 consent was granted under the umbrella STAR protocol. The trial was registered at clinical-
 trials.gov (NCT03898557).
 Design and setting. We conducted a cluster randomized trial of a planning and commit-
 ment prompt as part of the STAR-supported HIVST program in South Africa run by the
 Ezintsha unit of Wits RHI at the University of Witwatersrand. Ezintsha established a staffed
 WhatsApp mobile messaging line to enable self-testers to upload screening test results (includ-
 ing a photo of their completed test strip) and receive information about next steps: confirma-
 tory testing and linkage to care if positive, or advice about repeat testing if negative. However,
 usage of the WhatsApp line was initially low, with reporting rates below 5% in the early
 months of the program. 
<section> This study was conducted in 13 urban locations within Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality
 of Gauteng Province where Ezintsha’s STAR program operated. STAR distributed oral fluid-
 based HIV tests (Oraquick Advance, Orasure Technologies, Bethlehem, PA, USA) from mar-
 ket centers and other densely populated areas. Individuals passing by community fixed-point
 distribution sites, such as hotspots including taxi ranks and shopping areas, were offered infor-
 mation about HIVST and could obtain a self-test for personal use after receiving instructions
 and a demonstration of how to use the test.
 
<section> Recruitment and testing
 
<section> Community members who approached the STAR self-test distribution sites were eligible to
 participate in the study. Per the existing STAR protocol, inclusion criteria were that commu-
 nity members had to be �19 years of age and exclusion criteria was that they must not visibly
 intoxicated to receive a self-test. For each individual who accepted a test, program staff com-
 pleted a brief form collecting socio-demographic information and prior HIV testing history.
 Individuals who consented to follow-up by the STAR program were asked to provide their
 mobile phone number. Unique barcode stickers were placed on the self-test and on the form
 that linked the self-test to a specific individual. Individuals obtaining a self-test could either
 take the test with them for later use or complete the test immediately in a private portable tent.
 As mandated by South Africa’s National Department of Health, those who chose to take the
 self-test with them for later use were given a card with instructions for seeking confirmatory
 testing in the event of a positive self-test result. In the Ezintsha STAR program, this card also
 included the WhatsApp reporting number.
 
<section> Interventions
 
<section> We compared a plan and commit prompt (PC) to an enhanced usual care (EUC) version of
 the standard STAR distribution instructions, which were printed on cards and given to indi-
 viduals in their self-test packets. The EUC card explained how to report results via WhatsApp
 and emphasized the importance of reporting. The counselors’ verbal script similarly empha-
 sized the ease and confidentiality of WhatsApp reporting, and highlighted three reasons for
 reporting: 1. To ensure that the test was used correctly; 2. To get help interpreting the results;
 and 3. To get support and advice for linking to additional services and care if needed.
 The PC intervention differed from EUC in two ways: First, the printed card placed in the
 testing packet had additional spaces on the reverse side to make a plan to take the test (e.g.,
 location and timing of completing the test) and to commit to use the test by signing a brief
 statement. Second, the accompanying PC script pointed out the plan and commit features of
 the PC card and suggested how to use it. Importantly, the PC intervention did not require par-
 ticipants to complete the card at the time of test distribution nor did it require them to return
 the card to the testing staff. Completion of the card was entirely voluntary and was unobserved
 by the STAR program staff and the study team.
 
<section> Target population & power calculations
 
<section> Our target sample size of 1,320 self-test recipients (660 per arm) gave us power to detect a
 5-percentage point difference in WhatsApp reporting rates between the PC and EUC interven-
 tions, assuming a baseline reporting rate of 2.5% (as observed in previous iterations of the
 WhatsApp test result reporting initiative) and taking into account the clustered design with
 team-site-day as the unit of randomization. Each cluster of team-site-day pairs distributed self-
 tests until daily targets were met. 
<section> Randomization
 
<section> A cluster randomized design was used and the unit of randomization was the team-site-day.
 team consisted of two STAR program staff working together to distribute tests, demonstrate
 their use, and complete the data collection form. Two study teams worked simultaneously at
 selected testing site, in addition to other field staff distributing tests according to the standard
 protocol. Cluster randomization was used rather than individual randomization to ensure fea-
 sibility of intervention delivery and to align most closely with the existing test distribution pro-
 gramme. Each team pair distributed only EUC or PC cards in a given day.
 Using a computer-generated randomization scheme, the first author (AB) assigned each
 team-site-day to the EUC or PC intervention. After the trained study team distributed 30 tests
 according to the assigned EUC or PC condition in a given day at a given test site, the team
 reverted to the standard protocol for test distribution for the remainder of the day. Participants
 and the study team were not blinded as to condition.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome was test results reported to the program’s WhatsApp numbers as a pro-
 portion of tests distributed. The secondary outcome was the proportion of HIV-positive test
 results reported as proportion of tests distributed (i.e., reported yield). Outcomes were mea-
 sured by STAR program nurses who staffed the separate WhatsApp numbers for each of the
 two interventions. Nurses were not blinded as to condition of the WhatsApp number they
 were staffing, but were also not directly involved in the design of the study and were not famil-
 iar with the distinctions between arms.
 
<section> Analysis
 
<section> Following our pre-registered analysis plan, we compared test result reporting rates in the EUC
 and PC using chi-squared tests. As an exploratory analysis, we also compared the PC and EUC
 to the standard STAR protocol for test distributions during trial window using routine pro-
 gram data collected by the STAR program. Limitations in the recording of the WhatsApp
 results reporting meant that we were not able to assign individual results to clusters. In addi-
 tion, the routine program data do not follow a similar clustering. therefore, the confidence
 intervals and the chi-squared analyses are not adjusted for clustering. See the study protocol
 (S1 Text) for more details.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Between May 28 and June 18, 2019, 1,478 participants were recruited and accepted a self-test
 at 13 distribution sites (see Fig 1 for study flow diagram). The distribution of gender, age and
 testing history of the study participants is shown in Table 1 (left-hand columns). The sample
 was about half female, with the majority of participants aged 18–24. About one third of partici-
 pants had either never been tested for HIV or had not tested in the past year.
 In the PC condition, 63/731 participants (8.7%) reporter their test results via WhatsApp,
 compared to 59/747 participants (7.9%) in the EUC (n.s., p = 0.61) (see Fig 1). While the study
 was not powered to detect subgroup differences in response to the interventions, an explor-
 atory analysis by gender suggests that Plan & Commit was more effective then Enhanced
 Usual Control among women (35/365, 9.5%, vs. 26/398, 6.5%), while the opposite was true for
 men (28/361, 7.8%, vs. 33/348, 9.5%).
 During the study period, 101/3199 individuals (3.1%) who received a self-test under the
 standard protocol reported test results via WhatsApp, a significant difference across the three

<section> arms (p < .00001). No HIV-positive test results were reported PC and EUC intervention
 groups. Among the 3,199 other self-tests distributed under the standard protocol during the
 interventions period, no positive tests were reported (see Fig 2).
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> In this pragmatic randomized field trial, we tested two interventions hypothesized to increase
 the likelihood that individuals receiving HIV self-tests would report their test results back to
 the testing program. An enhanced usual care intervention emphasized the importance of
 reporting results and explained the process for doing so, while a “plan and commit” interven-
 tion added a planning prompt and a voluntary commitment pledge to use the test and report
 self-test results. Both interventions had similar test result reporting rates that were more than
 double the reporting rates observed in the HIVST program’s standard protocol.
 Our results suggest that boosting the reporting of self-test results can be done solely through
 increasing the salience of results reporting by emphasizing why reporting is important and by
 providing a clear explanation of the procedure for reporting results. The plan and commit
 intervention as implemented in this study did not significantly increase test result reporting

<section> above and beyond enhanced usual care. One conclusion from this study is that the mecha-
 nisms through which planning prompts and commitment devices work may be similar to
 those of a salience intervention: these strategies all drawing people’s attention to the impor-
 tance of the behavior and prompt them to complete the behavior at a future time. Our results

<section> participants). 
<section> are consistent with previous studies showing no changes in behavior due to planning prompts
 [14–17], and a recent trial that showed planning prompts resulted in small but statistically
 insignificant changes in HIV testing uptake by men in Uganda [8]. However, they are in con-
 trast with other studies demonstrating the effectiveness of planning prompts over and above
 reminders, information provision, or education [18].
 Our study has some important limitations. To maximize feasibility and generalizability,
 participants were not asked to complete the planning and commitment prompts at the time
 self-test distribution. Completing the prompts at the distribution site might result in higher
 test result reporting rates. We were also unable to assess whether participants who did not
 report test results had used the self-test but not reported results, or if they did not use the self-
 tests at all. Some challenges with linking WhatsApp reporting results to test distribution also
 meant that we were unable to evaluate additional outcomes of interest including time to test
 result reporting, and prior testing history as a predictor of results reporting or as a treatment
 modifier. Finally, our decision to distribute tests following the Plan & Commit and Enhanced
 Usual Care protocols at the beginning of the testing day, followed by the standard protocol
 once the requisite number of intervention tests had been distributed, could potentially intro-
 duce a biased comparison of the two interventions to the standard protocol if community
 members stopping by the test distribution site at the beginning of the day were systematically
 different from those arriving later in the day. However, this would only affect the results of our
 exploratory analysis, and the risk of bias is attenuated by the fact that many standard protocol
 tests were distributed at sites that were not an intervention site in any given day and were
 therefore distributed throughout the full testing day.
 A strength of the study is the light-touch, very low-cost interventions that are both feasible
 to incorporate into HIVST programs and easy to evaluate, with only 13 days in the field
 needed to accrue the desired sample size. This underscores the potential to rapidly design and
 evaluate similar low-cost, light-touch “nudges” that can contribute to progress on reaching the
 UNAIDS 2025 targets.
 HIVST has shown considerable potential to close gaps in the HIV care cascade and com-
 munity-based distribution of self-tests can enable programs to “reach people where they are.”
 However, to maximize the effectiveness of HIVST, it will be necessary for self-tests to be used
 by PLHIV who are unaware of their status and persons at high risk of HIV infection. It will
 also be essential for those who obtain positive results to seek confirmatory testing and follow-
 up care. Interventions informed by behavioral economics can be easily incorporated into exist-
 ing HIVST programs and warrant further testing as part of efforts to improve the effectiveness
 of HIVST.
