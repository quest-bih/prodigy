<section> Research in context
 
<section> Evidence before this study
 There are no systematic reviews of interventions to prevent
 violence against children by school staff. We searched the
 Cochrane and Psychinfo databases from the first record to
 May 1, 2020 using the terms “corporal punishment’, “physical
 punishment”, “violence against children”, “physical discipline”,
 “violence”, and “school”. We found three randomised trials that
 assessed teachers’ use of violence against children, one done in
 secondary schools and two in primary schools. The most
 rigorous trial was an evaluation of the Good School Toolkit in
 Ugandan primary schools that found a 42% reduction in
 past-week violence against children by school staff in the
 group allocated to the toolkit.
 
<section> A systematic review of interventions for disruptive behaviour
 problems in low and middle-income countries (LMIC)
 identified three school-based trials published up to
 November 2016, targeting preschool age children. We
 searched the Cochrane and Psychinfo databases to identify
 school-based, randomised trials with preschool-age children
 in LMIC from Nov 12, 2016, to May 1, 2020, with the terms
 “aggression”, “disruptive behaviour”, “conduct problems”,
 “externalising disorders”, and “school”. One further trial from
 Uganda was identified. Three of the four trials were small-
 scale and done in ten schools or fewer. The largest study was
 an efficacy trial in 24 Jamaican preschools that reported
 reductions in behavioural problems of preschoolers at high
 risk for antisocial behaviour by independent observation and
 reports from teachers and parents.
 
<section> violence-prevention programmes with quantitative
 measures of teachers’ use of violence against children
 have been done in primary and secondary schools. 5–7
 Early-onset conduct problems are the most common
 mental health concerns in children and predict juvenile
 delinquency, and crime and violence in adulthood; these
 disruptive behaviour problems are reduced through early
 preventive interventions. 8 However, few trials have been
 done in LMICs, especially in the pre-primary years. 3,9,10
 The Irie Classroom Toolbox 11 is a universal, early child­
 hood, violence-prevention teacher-training pro­ gramme
 designed for use in LMICs, that aims to reduce violence
 against children by teachers and prevent the early
 development of antisocial behaviour in children aged
 3–8 years. The Toolbox also aims to improve the quality of
 the classroom environment and to promote child mental
 health, self-regulation, and prosocial skills. In this study we
 evaluated the effectiveness of the Irie Classroom Toolbox in
 a cluster-randomised trial in inner-city Jamaican preschools.
 
<section> Methods
 Study design and participants
 We did a two-arm, single-blind, cluster-randomised trial
 with parallel assignment in community preschools
 
<section> Added value of this study
 This is the first study of a preschool violence-prevention
 programme with direct measurements of teachers’ use of
 violence against children and the first trial in any school setting
 to include follow-up measurements of this outcome. The
 teacher-training programme led to large and sustained
 reductions in teachers’ use of violence against children.
 We found no benefits with this programme on child aggression
 at the classroom level. However, the intervention led to benefits
 for a wide range of secondary outcomes at the level of (1) the
 classroom (ie, the quality of the classroom environment and
 class-wide child pro-social behaviour); (2) the teacher
 (ie, teachers’ wellbeing and retention); and (3) the children
 (ie, child inhibitory control and mental health of high-risk
 children). The results inform the provision of in-service training
 initiatives for preschool teachers in LMIC to prevent child
 maltreatment and improve child functioning.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 School-based violence-prevention programmes implemented in
 LMIC are an effective strategy to reduce teachers’ use of violence
 against children. Further research is required to identify a broader
 set of strategies to eliminate child maltreatment in schools.
 Research is also needed on how to fully integrate school-based
 interventions into ongoing pre-service and in-service teacher
 training and other school improvement initiatives with sufficient
 quality to maintain effectiveness, and to identify how the
 changes to teacher behaviour can be sustained over time.

 Parents pay a small fee and provide school supplies.
 Preschool was the unit of randomisation to prevent
 contamination among teachers. Inclusion criteria for
 preschools were two to four classes of children, at least
 ten children per class, situated in urban areas of
 Kingston and St Andrew, and all teachers consenting to
 participate in the trial. We assessed 173 preschools for
 eligibility and 120 preschools met the inclusion criteria;
 76 of these eligible preschools were randomly selected to
 participate in the study using simple randomisation
 with a computer-generated random number sequence
 (figure). Within each school, we used simple randomi­
 sation (with a random number table) to select up to
 12 children aged 4 years for evaluation of child outcomes.
 In preschools with 12 or fewer children aged 4 years and
 in schools with 13 eligible children, all children were
 recruited. We selected children in the 4-year-old classes
 only because children in the 5-year-old classes were
 transitioning to primary school before the start of the
 intervention and some children in the 3-year-old class

<section> The Irie Classroom Toolbox intervention
 
<section> Content and materials
 The Irie Classroom Toolbox consists of four modules:
 (1) creating an emotionally supportive classroom environment;
 (2) preventing and managing child behaviour problems;
 (3) teaching social and emotional skills; and (4) individual and
 class-wide behaviour planning.
 
<section> Intervention materials for teachers include (1) a tools book
 that provides simple guidelines on how to use each strategy
 and the underpinning rationale; (2) an activity book of songs,
 games, activities, lesson plans, and behaviour planning forms;
 (3) three sets of picture cards to help teachers teach classroom
 rules, friendship skills, and understanding emotions; and (4) a
 problem-solving stories book consisting of 14 pictorial stories
 depicting common classroom problems that children
 encounter in school, and strategies that children can use to
 overcome them (eg, how to work together as a team, and how
 to share classroom materials). All materials are available
 
<section> For the 
<section> Irie Classroom Toolbox 
<section> online.
 
<section> materials see
 
<section> www.irietoolbox.com 
<section> Procedures
 The teacher-training workshops include the use of
 brainstorms, live and videotape modelling, role-play and
 rehearsal, discussions, card-sorting activities, and small group
 activities. In our study, five full-day workshops were
 undertaken, and full details of the content and process for
 each workshop were provided in a training manual. Eight
 in-class support sessions were designed to support the
 content covered in workshops. Guidelines for the in-class
 support sessions were given in a coaching manual. All
 sessions included three steps: (1) a brief 5-min planning
 discussion with the teacher; (2) supporting the teacher in the
 classroom by modelling the strategies, prompting the teacher
 to use them, providing supportive feedback, and helping the
 teacher to problem-solve (around 45 min); and (3) debriefing
 and goal-setting (around 10 min). Teachers also received
 practical classroom assignments to be completed after each
 in-class support session. Fortnightly phone text messages
 were sent to all intervention teachers using an SMS service.
 
<section> Who provided the Toolbox intervention?
 Eight female staff assisted in delivery of the intervention;
 when recruited, all staff had a Masters’ degree but no or little
 experience in child-behaviour management and early
 childhood education. Each teacher-training workshop was
 done by one facilitator and one co-facilitator who received
 2–3 days of training for each day of workshop delivered
 (a total of 12 days). Teachers were divided into four groups,
 based on geographical location, and workshops were done
 with groups of 24–35 participants. The four co-facilitators of
 the workshops provided in-class support, and each was
 responsible for 9–10 preschools (around 30 teachers). The
 co-facilitators were supervised by two of the workshop
 facilitators who supported them in field visits and met with
 them individually approximately once a month to discuss the
 progress of each teacher. Weekly group supervision meetings
 lasting around 1 h were held to problem-solve common
 issues faced and to discuss and practice each session before
 implementation.
 
<section> Further details for the Toolbox intervention
 Teacher training workshops were done in community centres
 (eg, preschools and church halls) in urban areas of Kingston,
 Jamaica. Teachers were given a small stipend to cover
 transportation costs (US $4 per workshop) and lunch was also
 provided.
 Teachers attended five full-day (6 h) workshops over one
 school year. 3 days of workshop were done in the summer
 holiday before the start of term, one workshop day was held in
 the half-term break in October, and the remaining workshop
 day was held in the half-term break in February. In-class
 support was provided to each intervention teacher once per
 month for 8 months from September to April, for
 approximately 1 h each session. Teachers in the intervention
 schools were offered one additional training workshop in the
 summer holiday as a refresher before the start of the next
 school year; 50% of teachers opted to attend this additional
 workshop.
 
<section> The intervention was manualised and largely implemented in
 a standard way with all teachers. Workshops were fully
 scripted and done as planned with minimal modifications.
 All teachers were offered the same number of in-class support
 sessions. During these sessions, the content was the same for
 all teachers, although teachers would receive different types
 of assistance in the classroom depending on their needs,
 competence, and engagement with the intervention.
 The workshop facilitators completed a training protocol and
 self-evaluation questionnaire after each workshop; all of the
 prescribed workshop content was covered. Teachers rated
 their opinion of the content, videos, facilitator skills, group
 discussion, role plays or demonstrations, and small-group
 work on a six-point scale from not at all helpful (0) to
 extremely helpful (5). The mean score across all workshops
 was 27·1 (out of a maximum score of 30), showing a high
 level of teacher satisfaction with the workshops. 52 teachers
 (48%) in the intervention group attended all five workshops;
 98 (91%) attended three or more. Facilitators similarly
 covered all prescribed content in the in-class support sessions;
 100 teachers (93%) participated in all eight in-class support
 sessions; 105 (97%) participated in seven or more. Teachers
 were given classroom assignments after the first seven
 in-class support sessions. 53 teachers (49%) did four or more
 of these assignments; 89 (82%) did two or more.

<section> Results
 
<section> Between June 22, 2015, and April 29, 2016, after
 baseline measurements were completed, we assigned
 38 preschools (with 119 teachers) to the Toolbox
 intervention and 38 (with 110 teachers) to control.
 preschools were followed up at post-intervention and
 1-year follow-up (figure). Because of teacher turnover,
 29 teachers (13%) were lost at post-intervention
 
<section> (11 intervention, 18 control) and 39 teachers (17%) were
 lost at 1-year follow-up (14 intervention, 25 control).
 865 children were recruited; 441 in the Toolbox
 intervention schools and 424 in the control schools
 (figure). 82 children selected for evaluation (9%) were
 lost at post-intervention (43 intervention, 39 control);
 reasons for loss are in the figure. There were no
 significant differences between teachers and children
 lost and those retained on any of the baseline outcome
 measures (appendix p 3). However, teachers lost had been
 teaching at their current school for fewer years than
 those retained. Compared with intervention-assigned
 teachers, more of the control teachers lost at post-
 intervention had completed high school (17 [94%] control
 vs seven [64%] intervention) and more control teachers
 lost at post-intervention and at follow-up were trained
 teachers (11 [61%] control vs two [18%] intervention; and
 ten [40%] control vs one [7%] intervention, respectively).
 There were no significant differences between the study
 groups on child and teacher characteristics. Classrooms
 in intervention schools had significantly more children
 than classrooms in control schools (table 2).
 Intervention teachers attended a mean 4·11 full-day
 workshops (SD 1·19) and participated in a mean 7·89
 in-class support sessions (0·56). All prescribed content
 was covered, and teachers reported high levels of
 satisfaction with the intervention (panel).
 There were no significant baseline differences between
 the groups for the raw data for all outcomes (tables 3, 4).
 2). At baseline, there were a median seven instances of
 violence against children over one school day in both
 groups (IQR 2–15 Toolbox, 1–18 control, respectively);
 27 teachers (12% of all teachers) used no violence over
 2 days of observation. The most commonly used form of
 to violence was physical violence, which usually involved
 for hitting a child with the hand. Threatening children with
 the physical punishment was the most common form of
 for verbal abuse. Scores for observed class-wide child
 aggression and class-wide prosocial behaviour were in
 no the low range. Scores for quality of the classroom
 environment were in the mid-range for emotional
 is support and classroom organisation, and in the low
 range for instructional support. 152 children (18%) were
 in the abnormal range for behaviour difficulties by
 teacher report.
 In the Toolbox intervention group there were
 significantly fewer counts of violence against children by
 teachers over one school day compared with the control
 group at both post-intervention and 1-year follow-up (post-
 intervention: Toolbox group median counts 3 [IQR 0–11] vs
 control group median counts 15 [3–35]; effect size
 –67·12%, 95% CI –80·71 to –53·52, p<0·0001; 1-year
 follow-up: Toolbox median counts 3 [IQR 0–9] vs control
 All median counts 6 [1–16]; effect size –53·86%, 95% CI
 –71·08 to –36·65, p<0·0001; table 5). There were no
 differences between the groups in class-wide child
 aggression at post-intervention (effect size 0·07, 95% CI

<insert> also significantly greater in the intervention group at this
 point compared with control. At 1-year follow-up there
 were no between-group differences in scores for class-
 wide prosocial behaviour, instructional support, or
 teachers’ use of violence against children over 2 days.
 Children in intervention schools had higher scores in
 tests of inhibitory control (table 5) and had reduced odds
 of clinical-level behaviour problems at post-intervention.
 There were no significant between-group differences in

 follow-up, and primary outcomes measured through

 that intervention teachers behaved differently during the
 observational assessments. How­ever, when observations
 are done over a full day, teacher reactivity to being
 observed is minimised. 30 In this study, teachers were
 observed over two full school days at each data collection
 period, with the continuous measurements of violence
 against children by teachers done on the second day. The
 structural conditions of community preschools, with
 classrooms usually sharing a common space and high
 noise levels, reduce any intrusiveness of the observer.
 Furthermore, our data show that intervention effects on
 violence against children by teachers did not significantly
 differ across the school day (appendix p 5). The psycho­
 metric properties of the outcome measures were good,
 except for the low stability of observations of class-wide
 prosocial behaviour and instructional support over 1 year.
 Study limitations included the differential teacher
 attrition across study groups, indicating that the
 intervention reduced teacher turnover. Contamination
 was minimised through the use of a cluster design;
 however, schools were situated in a common geographical
 region and it is possible that some sharing occurred.
 Schools with fewer than two and more than four
 classrooms, and schools with fewer than ten children per
 class were excluded for logistical reasons related to the
 evaluation; it is likely that the intervention would have
 similar effects in these community preschools in
 Jamaica. Children with poor attendance were ineligible
 for the evaluation and it is probable that poor attendance
 would reduce the benefits of intervention. However, only
 around 3% of children were excluded for poor attendance.
 The Irie Classroom Toolbox is suitable for teachers of
 children aged 3–8 years and was designed for use with
 undertrained teachers working in low-resource contexts.
 The Toolbox was developed by linking evidence-based
 content and behaviour change techniques to the enablers
 and barriers of intervention implementation by early-
 childhood teachers. 11 The process of development has
 been described in detail previously 11 and provides a
 framework for adapting the Toolbox to early childhood
 educational settings in other LMIC. Adaptation would
 involve identifying to what extent the enablers and
 barriers to intervention implementation differ in the
 new context and making changes to the content,
 structure, materials, or process of delivery as needed.
 Adaptations would also need to be made to the visual
 aids used with the children to ensure that they reflect the
 cultural context. As the Toolbox is theory informed,
 incorporates empirically derived content and behaviour
 change techniques, and was developed to be adaptable
 and feasible in low-resources settings, we anticipate that
 it has potential for effectiveness in early childhood
 educational contexts in other LMIC. This needs to be
 tested in future trials. The Toolbox is suitable for use in
 pre-service and in-service teacher-training and all teacher
 manuals and materials are available online.
