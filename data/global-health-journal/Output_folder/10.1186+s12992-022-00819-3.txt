<section> Background
 The adolescent period marks a transitional phase
 between childhood and adulthood where a depend-
 ent vulnerable child is transformed into a strong inde-
 pendent adult. The World Health Organization (WHO)
 defines adolescents as the age group between 10 and
 19 years [1]. The United Nations defines “youth” as
 persons aged between 15 and 24 years and “young peo-
 ple” as persons aged between 10 and 24 years [1]. This
 characterizes the time period starting from puberty
 to an economically independent adult [2]. Within this
 age group adolescents can struggle to cope with physi-
 cal, psychological, and emotional development. They
 are often subject to peer pressure, school achievement
 pressure, parental expectations, social affirmation,
 and bombarded by technology. Adolescents engag-
 ing in these struggles run the risk of being labelled
 troublemakers and uncontrollable by school teachers,
 and unmanageable and irresponsible by their parents
 and the society. These issues can also be compounded
 within a post-conflict situation where adolescents may
 have been exposed to traumatic events which can lead
 to worsening of emotional and behavioural problems
 [1].
 The WHO’s “Health for the world’s adolescents”
 report indicates that the predominant cause of illness in
 boys and girls aged 10- 19 years is depression [2]. Glob-
 ally, the top 3 causes of adolescent death are road traffic
 accidents, Human Immuno Defficiency Virus/Aquired
 Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and suicide
 [2–5]. The Youth Risk Behaviour Surveillance study
 carried out by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC)
 revealed 7 major risk behaviours for adolescents [6].
 
<section> Risk factors included: un-intentional injuries, violence,
 tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, unhealthy sex-
 ual behaviours leading to unwanted pregnancies and
 sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), inadequate diet,
 poor physical activity [6].
 Behavioural disorders in adolescents can be classified
 as follows; anxiety disorders, severe depression, bipolar
 disorders, attention –deficit/hyperactivity disorders,
 learning disorders, conduct disorders, and adjustment
 problems of adolescents with themselves, with parents,
 with their school discipline and the community [4, 5].
 Behavioural problems among school-going adolescents
 are multi-factorial in nature and can go unnoticed by
 parents and teachers, and are therefore early interven-
 tion is not engaged with. When behavioural problems
 of adolescents go unidentified or are left untreated it
 
<section> problems, Yoga-based intervention
 
<section> may lead to several negative health consequences such
 as obesity, high blood pressure, stroke, unhealthy lipid
 profiles, and diabetes over the long term [5].
 Sri Lanka’s total population is 21.4 million. Adolescents
 (10- 19 years) comprise 16% of the total population. Out
 of this 71% of the adolescents are school going and 21.9%
 of them are non-school going [7]. There are approxi-
 mately 4 million children studying in 10,000 schools
 across Sri Lanka [7]. Sri Lanka provides primary and sec-
 ondary prevention programs for the physical and mental
 health of students. From 1983 until 2009, Sri Lanka was
 engaged in a civil conflict which displaced approximately
 800,000 people [8]. This conflict had a significant impact
 on individual health along with disrupting family and
 community structures resulting in collective trauma [8].
 A previous study on mental health issues of 13-15 year-
 old school students in the Jaffna district revealed that
 30% of the students had mental health issues [9]. This is
 three times higher than the rest of the country, as well
 as when compared to other South East Asian countries
 [9]. Currently, within the school system in Northern Sri
 Lanka there are no guidelines for how to handle behav-
 ioural issues in adolescents. The present best practice to
 is to refer adolescents with behavioural issues to a psy-
 chiatrist through their local primary care physician or
 pediatrician.
 Yoga is described in Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras of 900 B.
 C and originated in India. The meaning of Yoga in San-
 skrit language is yoke or bridge. Yoga unites the body and
 mind or man and God. The umbrella term yoga includes
 1) different physical postures (asanas), 2) breathing con-
 trol (pranayamas), 3) deep relaxation (yoganidra) 4) body
 cleansing techniques (kriyas) and 5) meditation. A study
 found significant reduction in tension and anxiety after
 30 min of yoga 2-3 times per week for 11 weeks in chil-
 dren and adolescents [10]. It also had significant impact
 on self-esteem, better memory performance, anger con-
 trol, reduced fatigue and inertia [11].
 Yoga taught in schools in other settings has shown
 improved physical and mental wellbeing of the young
 people by down regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-
 adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system [12]. This
 helped reduce stress and improves self-regulation skills,
 self- confidence and self-awareness [12]. Physiologically
 slowing breathing reduces the sympathetic drive thereby
 reducing anxiety through a feedback mechanism the par-
 asympathetic nervous system gets activated inducing a
 calm and relaxed state of mind [13]. This effect is imme-
 diate as well as sustainable therefore, it is a significantly 
<section> helpful tool to regulate emotional, social and spiritual
 wellbeing in practicing adolescents [13]. Currently, yoga
 is not part of policy or practice within the school system
 in Northern Sri Lanka.
 This study, then built on previous research to develop
 and implement a yoga-based intervention package to
 address behavioural issues in school-going adolescents in
 the post-conflict region of Jaffna, Sri Lanka.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> This study was a non-randomized controlled trial carried
 out in 4 educational zones in Jaffna, Northern Province,
 Sri Lanka over a 6-month period.
 The sampling frame was determined using informa-
 tion from the Northern Province Education Ministry
 website. There are 5 educational zones in Jaffna district.
 The Island zone consists of an area where the socioeco-
 nomic situation and family support is poor, however the
 other 4 zones are equal in socioeconomic and family sup-
 port. Therefore, to reduce bias the Island zone was not
 included. The sample size was calculated using the fol-
 lowing formula [14]. The number of participants in this
 study per cluster was set as (m) =
 
<section> 2  Z a/2 + Z b  2  s 2  1 + (m − 1)r 
 
<section> N 
<section> =
 
<section> (m 1 − m 2 )
 
<section> The calculated sample size for each arm was 331 grade
 8 students (ages 13-15). After adding 10% for possible
 non-responders the final sample was 365 in each arm.
 As per the cluster size of 15, 25 clusters were randomly
 selected: 11 schools for each arm in the designated edu-
 cational zones were recruited for the study. 584 students
 were included in the intervention arm and 499 in the con-
 trol group. Vadamaradchi and Valikamum educational
 zones schools were selected as controls as they were not
 exposed to any type of regular yoga-based program over
 the past 2 years, and geographic proximity. Jaffna and
 Thenmaradchi zones were selected for the yoga-based
 intervention due to geographic proximity. Within each
 school allocated to intervention, a grade 8 class (cluster)
 was randomly selected to be in the intervention group.
 Within each school allocated to control, a grade 8 (clus-
 ter) was randomly selected to be in the control. Students
 within the clusters were not randomized.
 
<section> Inclusion criteria for both arms: grade 8 school stu-
 dents (13-14 years old) studying in Jaffna and Then-
 maradchi educational zones for 6 months (intervention
 group) or studying in the Valikamam and Vadamaradchi
 educational zones for 6 months (control group), without
 any diagnosed mental health disorders or spine abnor-
 malities. Exclusion criteria for both arms: cognitive or
 learning impairment, or mental health issue so severe
 consent could not be gained.
 The yoga-based intervention package was developed
 with a panel of experts including a consultant psychia-
 trist, religious leaders, consultant community physi-
 cians, and an official from the Ministry of Education.
 It was determined the yoga-based intervention would
 be delivered in the selected schools from 7:30 am to
 7:50 am, Monday to Thursday for 6 months (2 school
 terms). Below is a detailed description of the yoga-based
 intervention.
 
<section> 1. Two types of slow breathing techniques (Suga- pra-
 nayama (normal deep breathing), Nadi sudhi (alter-
 nate nostril) pranayama) for 5-6 min.
 2. Surya-namaskaram for 6-8 min.
 3. Mindfulness meditation for 5-6 min.
 
<section> Students in the control group continued with their
 normal school “keep fit” physical exercise routine. This
 “keep fit routine” consists of 20 min of dancing to music
 Mondays to Thursdays across all schools. Those in the
 intervention group participated in the yoga-based pack-
 age while those in the controls remained in their “keep
 fit” routine classes.
 The yoga-based intervention was delivered by local
 yoga teachers who were hired for the first 2 weeks of the
 intervention. To increase sustainability after the 2-week
 period student leaders took over the program under
 supervision of the sports science teachers or counselling
 teachers.
 The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)
 was used pre/post for both groups and had already been
 validated for use [15]. The SDQ was chosen as it is a brief
 behavioural screening questionnaire for 3–16-year-olds.
 The SDQ consists of 25 items divided between 5 scales:
 emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/
 inattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial
 behaviour. Scores on each scale are added together to
 generate a total difficulties score (based on 20 items). The
 SDQ used to quantify baseline behaviour of school-going
 adolescent participants from respective perspectives of
 students, parents and teachers.
 Assessments were conducted at baseline and at
 6 months post yoga intervention for the intervention arm
 and the control arm. The SDQ was administered to stu-
 dents face-to-face, while teachers and parents completed
 in their own time. It takes 5-10 min to complete the SDQ.
 Pre-test questionnaire data collection took 2 weeks and
 post-test questionnaire data collection took 3 weeks (due
 to students forgetting to return their parents assessments
 from home).

 intervention trial 
<iend>

 At 6 months post-baseline, two focus group discus-
 sions were carried with participants in the intervention
 arm out in two selected educational zones [Jaffna Hindu
 Ladies College (n = 16) and Chavakatcheri Ladies College
 (n = 20)] to explore participant opinions on the interven-
 tion program. Focus group were used to deepen under-
 standing of the impact the intervention had. Example
 questions included, “How do you feel about your edu-
 cational achievements now?” and “have you noticed any
 changes in dynamics with your family?” Focus groups
 lasted 40-45 min each and were run over 2 consecutive
 days.
 A pilot study was carried out for 2 weeks in a different
 district within Jaffna, Northern Province to identify and
 overcome any technical issues in the intervention pack-
 age. Revisions were made as necessary before implement-
 ing the full study. The full study was conducted from
 January-July 2018 in four educational zones of Jaffna,
 Northern Province, Sri Lanka.
 
<section> Primary outcomes
 1) Parent and teacher assessments of externalizing prob-
 lems (conduct problem, hyperactivity) and internalizing
 problems (emotional issues, peer problems), total diffi-
 culty scores and prosocial social scores as measured by
 the SDQ in both intervention and control groups.
 2) Student self-assessments of externalizing problems
 (conduct problem, hyperactivity) and internalizing prob-
 lems (emotional issues, peer problems), total difficulty
 scores and prosocial social scores as measured by the
 SDQ in both intervention and control groups.
 3). Focus group with students in the intervention group
 who wished to participate to qualitatively investigate
 any changes in health, school achievement, and family
 dynamics.
 
<section> Analysis
 
<section> Paired t-test and independent t-test were completed for
 both arms of the study population using SPSS21. A com-
 parison of post-test scores between the intervention and
 control arms was completed to understand any signifi-
 cant intervention effect differences. Compliance with the
 implementation of yoga-based intervention was moni-
 tored by the designated teachers in the schools as well as
 by the principal investigator by a record system. Focus
 groups were analysed using thematic analysis to under-
 stand common themes across the intervention group.
 
<section> Ethics approval
 Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the
 Ethics review committee of the Faculty of Medicine,
 University of Kelaniya (P/217/08/2017). The trial was
 registered with the Sri Lanka trial registry (Registration
 
<section> No: SLCTR/ 2018/002 Date of Registration: 23rd Janu-
 ary 2018). Parents indicated written consent for students,
 and students indicated assent to participate in the study.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Sociodemographic characteristics
 There were 535 male, 549 female (N = 1084) students in
 the study. 1056 students were 13 years of age and 28 were
 14 years old. 1065 of the students were of Tamil ethnic-
 ity, with 19 identifying as non-Tamil. 933 students were
 of Hindu faith, 132 Christian, and 19 Islamic. There was
 no significant difference in the age and sex distribution in
 the intervention and control arms (Table 1).
 Despite not matching intervention and control group
 participants, each group was very similar to each other
 in regards to sociodemographics (49.3% male in con-
 trol, 49.4% male in intervention; 50.7 female in control;
 50.6% female in intervention). This pattern of similarity
 extended to ethnicity, age, and religion (Table 1). There
 was no loss to follow-up in either participant groups over
 the 6-month time period (Fig. 1).
 
<section> Intervention group results
 Baseline and the post-intervention SDQ scores from par-
 ents, teachers and students were analysed using paired
 t-tests (Table 2). The parent assessment indicated stu-
 dents’ total difficulty score, as well as emotional con-
 duct, hyperactivity and peer problems reduced after
 6 months of participating in the yoga-based intervention,
 the reduction was highly significant. Student’s prosocial
 score also significantly increased after 6 months of the
 yoga-based intervention.

 Parents’ assessments indicate conduct problems and
 hyperactivity problems were reduced and this was sta-
 tistically significant [conduct problems t (585) = 33.37,
 p = 0.001; hyperactivity problems t(584) = 28.08,
 p = 0.001]. Similarly, scores for internalizing problems
 also reduced and this was statistically significant [emo-
 tional problems t(584) = 11.41, p = 0.001; peer prob-
 lems t(584) = 6.71, p = 0.001]. The total difficulty scores
 also reduced after the intervention and this was statisti-
 cally significant [t(584) = 28.12, p = 0.001]. The prosocial
 score was improved and this was statistically significant
 [t(584) = − 30.16, p = 0.001].
 Teachers’ assessments for externalizing problems,
 namely conduct problem and hyperactivity problems
 were reduced and this was statistically significant [con-
 duct problem t(584) = 20.5, p = 0.001; hyperactivity
 problems t(584) = 17.5, p = 0.001]. Similarly, scores for
 internalizing problems were reduced but the reduc-
 tion was statistically significant only for peer problems
 (emotional problems t(584) = 1.6, p = 0.12; peer prob-
 lems t(584) = 16.9, p = 0.001]. Total difficulty scores
 reduced after the intervention and this was statisti-
 cally significant [t(584) = 19.9, p = 0.001). The proso-
 cial score improvement was also statistically significant
 [t(584) = − 28.5, p = 0.001).
 Students’ self-assessment for externalizing problems,
 namely conduct problem and hyperactivity problems
 were reduced and this was statistically significant [con-
 duct problems t(584) = 31.9, p = 0.001; hyperactivity
 problems t(584) = 13.7, p = 0.001]. Scores for internal-
 izing problems were reduced and this was statistically
 significant [emotional problems t(584) = 6.4, p = 0.001;
 peer problems t(584) = 14.4, p = 0.001]. Total difficulty
 scores also reduced after the intervention and this was
 statistically significant [t(584) = 21.2, p = 0.001]. The
 prosocial score improvement was statistically signifi-
 cant [t(584) = − 36.5, p = 0.001). Please see Table 2 for

<section> Control group results
 The schools in the control group continued with their
 routine keep fit exercises and results can be found in
 Table 3. Pre- and post-assessment scores revealed the
 total difficulty scores and emotion, conduct, hyperactiv-
 ity, and peer problems worsened. Results found higher
 scores for each of the sub scales by parents, teach-
 ers and students themselves at the end of the 6-month
 period, and this was highly significant. Parents’ perspec-
 tives increased on conduct problems [t(499) = − 25.9,
 p = 0.001], hyperactivity problems [t(499) = − 51.4,
 p = 0.001). Similarly, scores for internalizing prob-
 lems increased and the increase was statistically sig-
 nificant. Emotional problems increased [t(499) = − 65.6,
 p = 0.001], along with peer problems [t(499) = − 47.6,
 p = 0.001]. Total difficulty scores increased after 6 months
 in the control group and the increase was statistically sig-
 nificant [t(499) = − 80.3, p = 0.001]. The prosocial score
 was reduced and the reduction was also statistically sig-
 nificant [t(499) = 43.1, p = 0.001].
 
<section> Teachers’ assessment for externalizing problems,
 namely conduct problems [t(499) = − 22.4, p = 0.001]
 and hyperactivity problems [t(499) = − 5.8, p = 0.001]
 increased significantly. Similarly, scores for internalizing
 problems such as emotional problems [t(499) = − 9.5,
 p = 0.001], and peer problems [t(499) = − 19.2, p = 0.001].
 Total difficulty scores increased post-intervention and
 this increase was statistically significant [t(499) = − 22.0,
 p = 0.001]. The prosocial score was reduced and this was
 statistically significant [t(499) = 13.5, p = 0.001].
 Students’ self-assessment for externalizing problems,
 such as conduct problems [t(499) = − 30.2, p = 0.001],
 and hyperactivity problems [t(499) = − 28.5, p = 0.001]
 increased significantly. Similarly, scores for internalizing
 problems such as emotional problems [t(499) = − 27.1,
 p = 0.001], and peer problems [t(499) = − 31.4,
 p = 0.001] increased significantly. Total difficulty scores
 increased significantly post-intervention [t(499) = − 47.9,
 p = 0.001]. The prosocial score also increased signifi-
 cantly [t(499) = 13.1, p = 0.001].

<section> Comparison of intervention and controls
 A statistically significant difference can be seen between
 the two groups in the post-test (Table 4). It should be
 noted the control group had consistently lower scores at
 baseline.
 Between groups parent post-test assessment of exter-
 nalizing behaviour showed a significant increase in
 conduct problems [t (557) = 11.71, p = 0.001] and
 hyperactivity [t (557) = 10.75, p = 0.001]. Parent post-
 test assessment of emotional problems [t (557) = 4.18,
 p = 0.001] and peer problems [t (557) = 16.72, p = 001]
 increased significantly. Total difficulty scores also
 increased [t (557 = 14.89, p = 0.001], while pro social
 scores decreased [t (557) = − 14.47, p = 0.001].
 Between groups teacher post-assessment of external-
 izing behaviour showed a significant increase in conduct
 problems [t (557) = 12.43, p = 0.001], and hyperactivity [t
 
<section> (557) = 10.90, p = 0.001]. Internalizing behaviours such
 as emotional problems also increased [t (557) = 8.22,
 p = 0.001], along with peer problems [t (557) = 20.75,
 p = 0.001]. Total difficult scores also increased [t
 
<section> (557) = 16.22, p = 0.001] while pro social scores decreased
 [t (557) = − 15.93, p = 0.001].
 Between group results from students’ assess-
 ments found externalizing behaviours such as
 conduct problems [t (557) = 3.13, p = 0.001] and hyper-
 activity [t (557) = 1.49, p = 0.001] increased. Internal-
 izing behaviours such as emotional problems increased
 [t (557) = 6.89, p = 0.001] along with peer problems [t
 
<section> (557) = 12.55, p = 0.001]. Total difficulty scores increased
 [t (557) = 7.80, p = 0.001] while pro social scores
 decreased [t (557) = − 4.28, p = 0.001].
 
<section> Focus group results
 Results found from the focus groups found students
 found the yoga program had a positive impact on their
 health, school achievements and family dynamics. A
 majority of students noted they felt their stress levels had
 been significantly reduced, with one student noting, “my
 mind has quieted a lot now”. Students also noted they
 felt, “problem solving is relatively easy for me now” and
 reported feeling less fatigued, “I used to get tired after ­ rd

 subject in school but now I am motivated to learn until
 the last period of school.” Students also noted a signifi-
 cant reduction in asthmatic attacks, “after this program
 I have not visited the hospital for nebulization.” General
 health also appeared to improve post-intervention with
 one student noting, “complaints about body pains have
 reduce quite a lot now”. Students also shared that they
 felt more confident noting, “I can quickly complete my
 homework easily.” Finally, students noted they felt their
 ability to handle family dynamics had improved, “I am
 able to tolerate others views without heated argument”,
 and “I have reduced fighting with my siblings now”.
 
<section> Discussion
 The current study used a cluster, non-randomized study
 to evaluate the implementation of a yoga-based inter-
 vention package in grade 8 school children (early adoles-
 cents) to address behavioural problems. The study was
 conducted in the post-conflict region of Jaffna, Sri Lanka.
 The period of adolescence can be difficult both physi-
 cally and psychologically. Issues can be compounded in
 an area that has been exposed to conflict and trauma [8,
 9]. Behavioural issues in school-going adolescents can go
 unnoticed by parents and teachers and if left unidentified
 or untreated can lead to negative health consequences
 [5]. The use of yoga within school settings can help to
 address behavioural issues and reduce risk of future
 health issues. Practicing Surya-namaskaram, breathing
 control techniques and mindfulness meditation reduces
 both externalizing symptoms (conduct problems and
 hyperactivity) as well as internalizing symptom (emo-
 tional problem and peer problems).
 Our results indicate that within the intervention group
 there was a significant positive impact of yoga on exter-
 nalizing behaviours (conduct problems, hyperactivity)
 and internalizing behaviours (emotional problems, peer
 problems) when assessed by parents, teachers and stu-
 dents. Prosocial scores (good behaviour) also increased
 significantly in the intervention arm and total difficult
 scores reduced across all assessments. The control group
 findings indicate the routine ‘keep fit’ exercises routinely
 engaged with at school sites did not have any significant 
<section> impact on externalizing or internalizing behaviours. It
 needs to be noted that comparison of post-test scores
 between groups did not indicate any meaningful effect.
 This could be due to lower observed baseline control
 group scores or could be due to control and intervention
 groups not being matched from the outset. The effect size
 of the intervention could not be calculated as the linear-
 ity and homogeneity assumptions for Analysis of covari-
 ates (ANCOVA) could not be fulfilled. This does limit
 our results, however our findings within the intervention
 group are still important to report.
 Our findings agree with findings of several other simi-
 lar studies. A systematic review revealed pre- and post-
 yoga intervention scores in children and adolescents aged
 5–18 years old showed significant reduction in their ten-
 sion and anxiety after performing 30 min of yoga prac-
 tice, 2-3 times per week for 11 weeks [11]. The children
 demonstrated greater self-esteem and better memory
 performance. Whereas the controls continued to worsen
 over time [11]. Mindfulness has also been shown to pro-
 mote psychological health and well-being in children and
 adolescents [16]. In an urban school in the U. S, 37 chil-
 dren who were identified as having emotional and behav-
 ioural disorders (EBD) were offered yoga training for
 ½ months [17]. The findings of pre- and post- interven-
 tion assessments by the students’ parents and their teach-
 ers suggested that children who were trained in yoga
 improved their attention in class and adaptive skills, and
 their depressive and behavioural symptoms were reduced
 significantly [17]. A meta-analysis suggests that yoga
 taught in schools improves physical and mental wellbe-
 ing of the young people by down-regulating the Hypotha-
 lamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis (HPA) and the sympathetic
 nervous system. This physiological change improves their
 emotional balance, mood, resilience and their self-reg-
 ulation skills [12]. An 8-week mindfulness-based stress
 reduction programme in a U. S medical school revealed
 that the meditators brain had an increased concentration
 of grey matter in the hippocampal area (centre for learn-
 ing, memory and emotional regulation), and a reduced
 concentration of grey matter in the amygdala (centre for
 fear, anxiety and stress) [18] of an individual when com-
 pared to the controls.
 This study found the practice of yoga (asana) and
 breath control improves attention and reduces behav-
 ioural symptoms in school-going children. Results indi-
 cate this intervention had a positive effect on student
 health, confidence, school achievement, and improved
 family dynamics. It is recommended this program be
 scaled up across Sri Lanka to reach all school-going chil-
 dren across the country. It is also recommended that this
 type of intervention be implemented in other, similar
 post-conflict settings.
 
<section> Strengths and limitations
 To reduce contamination, two education zones that were
 geographically close were selected as controls and the
 other two selected as trial zones. Schools within the con-
 trol and trial zones were selected randomly minimizing
 selection bias. Although yoga teachers were employed in
 the first 2 weeks, the students took leadership on a roster
 basis and continued over the 6-month period making the
 program cost-efficient and sustainable.
 To reduce overall bias rigorous criteria were used for
 participant selection, the four education zones were cho-
 sen to ensure participants in both intervention and con-
 trol groups originated from similar general population,
 and validated assessment instruments were used. Bias
 was reduced in the analysis as the data set was complete
 and there were no outliers found.
 Urban, rural schools or grade 1AB (with Advanced level
 Science included), 1C (Advanced level Arts Commerce
 included) and 1C (schools with only up to Ordinary level
 (grade 11) schools were not compared separately during
 the analysis and there could have been significant differ-
 ences missed. Intervention and control groups were not
 randomized and researchers were not blind to group
 allocation which could have introduced selection bias.
 Focus group discussions were only conducted with the
 intervention group, if focus groups were also conducted
 with control groups important information on current
 school exercise programs could have been gained. Focus
 groups were also quite large (n = 16; n = 20) and this may
 have limited people’s ability to share observations and
 insights. Further, both groups were female only which
 limits generalizability.
 
<section> Recommendations for future research
 Future research should include the deprived Island edu-
 cational zone as there may be specific student behavioural
 issues to address in this region. Further, findings from
 urban, rural schools or grade 1AB (with Advanced level
 Science included), 1C (Advanced level Arts Commerce
 included) and 1C (schools with only up to Ordinary
 level (grade 11) schools should be compared separately
 to understand any significant differences. Focus group
 work should be completed with smaller numbers of par-
 ticipants and with a more generalizable sample. Future
 research should also include scaling up implementation
 of the yoga-based intervention across other regions of
 the country to address potential unmet need within the
 school system.
 The comparison of post-test scores between interven-
 tion and control groups was not found to be meaningful
 perhaps due to lower baseline scores of the control group
 or because the groups were not matched from the out-
 set. Further, the effect size could not be calculated as the 
<section> linearity and homogeneity assumptions for ANCOVA
 could not be fulfilled. Future research should address
 these important limitations regarding effect size.
 
<section> Conclusions
 
<section> This school-based yoga program appears to help to
 reduce negative behaviours and promote positive behav-
 iours in school-going children in the post-conflict region
 of Jaffna, Sri Lanka. This intervention helped equip chil-
 dren to develop healthy coping skills to reduce risk of
 behavioural problems and negative health consequences
 in the future. This intervention is low-cost, simple to
 implement, and could be an effective strategy for school-
 going children in similar post-conflict situations.
