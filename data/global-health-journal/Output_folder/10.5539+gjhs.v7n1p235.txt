<section> Abstract
 
<section> Background: Helicobacter pylori infection is a common chronic human bacterial infection. Triple- therapy
 regimen containing a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, and either amoxicillin or metronidazole is
 commonly used as first-line treatment for its eradication. However, it may not provide the acceptable eradication
 rate. The present study was designed to evaluated efficacy of low dose furazolidone with amoxicillin and
 omeprazole for eradication of H- pylori.
 
<section> Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty patients with non- ulcer dyspepsia or peptic ulcer confirmed by
 upper GI endoscopy, plus H- pylori infection confirmed by rapid urease test were included in the study. They
 were randomly divided into two groups, and then received clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and omeprazole, or
 furazolidone (100 mg PO bid), amoxicillin, and omeprazole. They were evaluated using urea breath test at the
 end of the study.
 
<section> Findings: The eradication rates were 57.6% and 78.8% in clarithromycin and furazolidone groups, respectively.
 Their difference was statistically significant (P value 0.013). No side effect was seen in the furazolidone group.
 
<section> Conclusion: Low dose furazolidone rather than clarithromycin can be used as low- cost and effective drug for
 eradication of H- pylori, in combination with amoxicillin and omeprazole.

<section> 1. Introduction
 
<section> Helicobacter pylori (H- pylori) infection is one of the most common chronic human bacterial infections. It is
 responsible for the most frequent and persistent bacterial infections worldwide. H- pylori infection affects nearly
 half of the world’s population (Garza-González, Perez-Perez, Maldonado-Garza, & Bosques-Padilla, 2014). The
 consequences of the infection are chronic gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, gastric cancer, and primary
 gastric lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type (MALT lymphoma). Eradication of H- pylori may
 cure dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, and MALT lymphoma (Peedikayi, AlSohaibani, & Alkhenizan, 2014).
 The treatment programs for the implementation of H- pylori eradication therapy should be based on patient
 compliance, antibiotic medication history, and local antibiotic resistance. The common treatment programs
 included triple therapy, quadruple therapy (containing bismuth), sequential therapy, concomitant therapy with
 proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole for 10–14 days (Rongli & Liya,
 2014). However, H- pylori eradication treatments following these regimens produce cure rates lower than 80%,
 mainly due to an increase in clarithromycin resistance (Chuah, Tsay, Hsu, & Wu, 2011; Ayala,
 Escobedo-Hinojosa, de la Cruz-Herrera, & Romero, 2014). Multiple bacterial factors are influencing eradication
 therapy success rate, with the development of resistance to antibiotics as the most important. Moreover, poor
 patient compliance due to adverse reactions to the medications, the cost of the drugs, or patient difficulties
 complying with the therapy regimen should not be ignored (Song &Ang, 2014). Recently, the efficacy of triple
 therapy decreased globally due to the increased rate of clarithromycin resistance (Talebi Bezmin Abadi, 2014). A
 recent multicenter study showed that resistance rates have been 17.5% for clarithromycin, 14.1% for
 levofloxacin and 34.9% for metronidazol (Kanizaj & Kunac, 2014). So, investigation for other treatment
 regimens has been noticed (Federico, Gravina, Miranda, Loguercio, & Romano, 2014).

 Furazolidone is a synthetic nitrofuran derivative with bactericidal
 and Gram-negative bacteria. It is well absorbed in the

<section> 4. Discussion
 
<section> The present study suggested that furazolidone can be use as first line drug for eradication of H- pylori instead of
 clarithromycin. We reached the eradication rate near 80%, even though we have used low dose furazolidone (100
 mg per dose rather than 200 mg per dose that had been used in earlier similar studies).
 There are many schemes for treating H- pylori infection. However, an optimal treatment has not been defined,
 and there is not a single antibiotic treatment that can eradicate it (Garza-González et al., 2014). Undeniably, the
 H- pylori treatment story is far from complete. The current sharp fall in eradication rate of therapy has sobered to
 be careful in this topic (Talebi Bezmin Abadi, 2014). The effectiveness of the most commonly used therapies has
 been increasingly compromised by the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of H- pylori and by poor
 adherence to treatment by patients (Garza-González et al., 2014). The reason for the decrease in the efficacy of
 standard triple therapy is mainly due to the increase in the resistance against clarithromycin (lee & Kim, 2014).
 In general, several international guidelines for treating patients diagnosed with H- pylori infections are consistent
 with the use of triple therapy as the first-line treatment. This treatment consists of the administration of a proton
 pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin for 7-14 d (Ayala G et al., 2014). However, recent reports
 indicate that this regimen does not achieve acceptable eradication rate. The most important cause for the reduced
 success of standard triple therapy is the increasing rate of H- pylori clarithromycin/ metronidazole resistance
 (Peedikayi et al., 2014). The contributory factors to treatment failure are multidimensional and complex. Host
 genetic factors, H- pylori virulent factors, antibiotic resistant H- pylori strains, smoking habits, compliance to
 therapy and duration of therapy all affect the treatment outcome (Song & Ang, 2014). Clinical experience in Iran
 has demonstrated that the eradication rate of H- pylori with the standard therapy is much lower than the rate
 reported from western and developed countries, and a high rate of metronidazole resistance (37%) and an
 increasing rate of resistance to clarithromycin have emerged (Ghadir et al., 2011). So, research for more suitable
 therapy necessitates.
 
<section> Eisig and his colleagues (2005) have used quadruple therapy consisted of furazolidone, tetracycline, omeprazole,
 and bismuth for 7 days in patients with previous treatment failure. They have reported 67% eradication rate. He
 has studied another drug combination with furazolidone, levofloxacin, and lansoprazole in his later research,
 again in patients with previous treatment failure (Eisig et al., 2009). He has reported 88% eradication rate with
 this regimen. Isakov and his coworkers (2002) have evaluated efficacy of furazolidone, tetracycline, and
 omeprazole in eradication of H- pylori in patients with first-line treatment failure. They reached to 90%
 eradication rate. Combination of furazolidone and amoxicillin plus omeprazole has been evaluated by Felga and
 his collaborators (2008) in patients with first-line treatment failure. They have reported 68% eradication rate.
 The above mentioned studies have been performed on patients with previous treatment failure. All of them had
 used furazolidone 200 mg twice a day for 1 to 2 weeks. However, the main concern regarding use of
 furazolidone is the adverse effects observed, especially among individuals who do not adhere to the dietary
 restrictions recommended, since this drug belongs to the group of the MAO inhibitors. So, we used half of this
 dose in our study. We wanted to clarify the eradication rate with this dosage of the drug. This dosage has been
 used by Cheng and Hu (2009) in combination with amoxicillin, bismuth, and rebaprazole with the reported 82%
 eradication rate. The present study reached to the nearly same rate, though we did not used bismuth, and used
 omeprazole instead of rebaprazole. The eradication rate in the present study is comparable to studies of Eisig
 (2009), Isakov (2002), and Felga (2008); despite the fact that we had used half-dose furazolidone in combination
 with the low cost drugs (amoxicillin and omeprazole). The eradication rate was higher than that of the higher
 cost drug, clarithromycin. 
<section> 5. Conclusion
 
<section> The present study suggests that low- dose furazolidone can effectively be used for treatment of H- pylori to
 prevent the side effects of the drug.
