<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) produced by A. flavus and A. par-
 asiticus, can lead to death from aflatoxicosis when
 consumed in high doses and is a potent carcinogen.
 
<section> ► Observational studies showing an association be-

 confounding.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► This study is the first randomised controlled design
 to examine the impact of reducing aflatoxin exposure
 on child linear growth and serum aflatoxin levels.
 
<section> ► The intervention significantly and substantially re-
 duced serum aflatoxin levels, but had no effect on
 child linear growth at endline (primary outcomes).
 
<section> What do the new findings imply?
 
<section> ► The midline effect on linear growth (secondary out-
 come) suggests that future studies should explore
 these age-varying effects.
 
<section> plants are stressed. 1 AFs can be produced
 when these fungus-contaminated crops are
 not sufficiently dried before they are put in
 storage or when stored under humid condi-
 tions. 2 High doses of AFB , the type of AF
 produced by A. flavus and A. parasiticus, can
 lead to death from aflatoxicosis. 3 AFB is also
 1
 a potent carcinogen: chronic exposure can
 lead to hepatocellular carcinoma, especially
 in combination with hepatitis B infection.
 AF exposure has been hypothesised to lead
 to mucosal damage and subsequent nutrient
 malabsorption and increased intestinal
 permeability and immunomodulation. 1 4 A
 number of observational studies have shown
 an association between AFB exposure and
 1
 reduced linear growth in utero and in infants
 and young children. 5–8 An inherent limita-
 tion of these observational studies is that they
 cannot fully exclude confounding by factors 
<section> such as poverty, which is associated with poor cropping,
 harvesting, postharvest and storage practices, all of which
 can contribute to AF contamination of crops. 9 Recent
 evidence from Kenya shows that the serum AF levels in
 poor rural women with the worst socioeconomic back-
 ground was 4.7 to 7.1 times higher than those in women
 who were less poor. 10 Poverty is also associated with
 low-quality diets and frequent infections in children,
 both of which are associated with growth retardation.
 This study used a randomised controlled design to
 examine the impact of reducing AF exposure on child
 linear growth and serum AF levels in Eastern Kenya. More
 specifically, we hypothesised that reducing exposure to
 AF-contaminated maize would increase linear growth and
 reduce serum AFB -lysine adduct level in children under
 24 months of age. The Mitigating Aflatoxin Exposure to
 Improve Child Growth in Eastern Kenya (MAICE) study
 reported here is the first randomised controlled trial to
 evaluate the effect of reducing AF exposure on child
 linear growth.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> The study protocol was published previously. 12 A summary
 of the study methods is provided below.
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> A cluster randomised longitudinal trial design was used.
 Clusters were defined as villages, typically consisting of
 50 to 175 households (mean of 95, median of 86). The
 study was conducted in rural areas within Meru and
 Tharaka-Nithi counties in Kenya, an area where maize
 is the predominant crop and frequent aflatoxicosis
 outbreaks and widespread contamination of maize have
 been reported. 13–17 A total of 56 villages were randomly
 selected for inclusion in the study.
 A detailed data analysis plan was approved by the trial
 steering committee. Both the published protocol 12 and
 the data analysis plan were added to the public trial
 registry.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> Enrolment into the study was conducted in six waves,
 each 4 months apart (figure 1). In each wave, women in
 the fifth to final month of pregnancy (by the woman’s
 estimate) were invited to enrol in the study. One newly
 born child of each pregnant woman became part of the
 
<section> Figure 1 Study timeline.
 
<section> study. In case of twins or triplets, the names of children
 were ranked alphabetically, and the first was selected
 to be the study child. The child was followed until
 months after study enrolment during pregnancy.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 Using Stata, Kelly Jones assigned each village a random
 number from a uniform [0,1] distribution. Villages with
 a random number ≤0.5 were assigned to the intervention
 group; all others were assigned to the control group. Due
 to the nature of the intervention, assignment could not
 be masked.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> The MAICE intervention consisted of a swapping and a
 stockist component. In the swapping component, house-
 holds were offered monthly rapid maize testing at home
 by trained local staff. If the household agreed, any stored
 maize that the household was planning to consume over
 the next 2 months was tested using the US Grain Inspec-
 tion, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA)
 verified Romer AgraStrip rapid test with a 10 parts per
 billion (ppb) detection threshold, according to manufac-
 turer instructions. 12 Stored maize found to contain over
 10 ppb AF (the Kenyan regulatory limit for AF contam-
 ination) was replaced with an equal amount of “safe”
 maize, that is, maize tested to be under the regulatory
 limit. This component of the intervention was started in
 July 2013, shortly, after the second enrolment wave and
 several months after the originally planned interven-
 tion start date due to contracting and logistical delays
 (figure 1). In the first months of the trial, we observed
 that households acquired the majority of the maize they
 consumed through the market and not from own produc-
 tion. This was unexpected (based on the formative study,
 we conducted with 30 maize farmers in Meru county in
 2012) and was due to an unusually poor maize harvest in
 the study area in 2013. Since household maize purchases
 were typically small and frequent (more than once per
 month as originally hypothesised), the swapping compo-
 nent was less effective in reducing household AF expo-
 sure than anticipated. To increase intervention effec-
 tiveness, the stockist component was rolled out between
 January and March 2014, that is, after trial commence-
 ment. In this component, maize containing less than
 ppb AF was supplied to at least one shopkeeper in each of 
<section> the intervention villages; study household were encour-
 aged at an initial village meeting, and monthly during
 the swapping visits, to purchase this clean maize from the
 local stockist as needed.
 Since wave 1 participants were possibly not exposed to
 both components of the intervention long enough for
 it to have an impact (figure 1), a sixth enrolment wave
 was added to the five originally included in the study
 design. Per the original protocol, wave 1 households
 in the MAICE intervention group continued to receive
 the intervention for a 2-year period, but this group was
 excluded from follow-up data collection, in line with the
 registered, and subsequently published, study protocol.
 All data collection occurred at study participants’
 homes through face-to-face interviews using computer-as-
 sisted personal interview software on handheld tablets.
 The expectant mother was interviewed immediately after
 enrolment, and her height and weight were measured.
 A similar survey was repeated at endline, that is, at
 months, after enrolment of the pregnant mothers. At
 the time that the endline survey was conducted among
 the wave 3 participants, a midline survey was conducted
 among participants enrolled in the fourth through sixth
 waves, per the published protocol (figure 1). At each
 follow-up visit (midline for waves 4 through six and
 endline for all waves), the length and weight of the index
 child (the child the mother was expecting at enrolment)
 was measured using standard methods. 18 A venous blood
 sample was taken from the child for serum AFB -lysine
 adduct analysis. In addition to collecting data on the
 primary and secondary outcomes, data were collected
 on household demographics, education level of house-
 hold members, household food insecurity, 19 household
 dietary diversity using the Food and Nutrition Technical
 Assistance (FANTA) Household Dietary Diversity Score,
 household asset ownership and maternal height.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcomes were child length-for-age Z-score
 (LAZ, both as a continuous variable and as the prevalence
 of stunting) and child serum AFB -lysine adduct level at
 endline (24 months after enrolment of their pregnant
 mother, when children were on average 22 months old).
 Child LAZ, the prevalence of stunting and child serum
 AFB -lysine adduct level at midline (11 to 19 months after
 enrolment, when average child age was 13.3±3.6 months)
 were considered secondary outcomes.
 Anthropometric Z-scores were calculated using the
 2006 WHO growth standards. 21 Stunting was defined as
 LAZ below −2 SD of the age and sex-specific median of
 the growth standard. To determine serum AFB -lysine
 adduct level, serum samples were analysed using the
 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fluo-
 rescence method. Details on the HPLC analytic method
 used in this study have been published previously.
 Serum AFB -lysine adduct level was log transformed for
 the analyses.
 
<section> Statistical analyses
 Based on the magnitude of effect sizes of known effective
 nutrition interventions on linear growth, 22 the minimum
 detectable effect (MDE) for exposure to the intervention
 for the full 24-month period was set to 0.3 LAZ. This was
 then adjusted downward taking into account, the partial
 exposure to the intervention of participants recruited
 in waves 2 and 3 (prior to introduction of the stockist
 component) to give an MDE of 0.281. Other sample size
 parameters were a one-sided alpha of 0.05, 80% power
 and a SD of LAZ of 1.28. We first calculated the required
 sample size under the assumption of individual rando-
 misation. Next, we adjusted the calculations for an intr-
 acluster correlation of 0.05% and 9% attrition, and we
 assumed that 15% of variation in the outcome would
 be explained by baseline covariates. The estimated total
 number of participants required to achieve the study
 objectives was 924 across 56 villages. This sample size
 provides sufficient statistical power to detect an effect size
 of approximately 0.2 on serum AF.
 Data analysis followed the statistical analysis plan.
 All analyses were conducted using Stata V.15.0. In line
 with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
 (CONSORT) 2010 guidelines, no formal comparison of
 baseline means between the intervention and control
 arm was conducted. 23 Intention-to-treat analysis was used
 to assess the impact of the intervention. The impact on
 linear growth and serum AF levels at endline was assessed
 for all enrolment waves (excluding wave 1) combined.
 Ordinary least squares regression analysis was used to
 estimate the impact of the intervention. We estimated
 models that controlled for the complete set of prespec-
 ified baseline covariates, and reduced models, that is,
 models retaining only those socioeconomic covariates
 that were statistically significant. At the household level,
 the covariates included household food insecurity (using
 FANTA’s Household Food Insecurity Access Scale ),
 household dietary diversity (using FANTA’s Household
 Dietary Diversity Score ), household assets (a simple
 count of the total number of assets owned, proxy for
 household wealth) and the number of adult equivalents
 in the household. At the individual level, the models
 controlled for child sex and age (in months), maternal
 age, height and education and the educational level of
 the head of household. Finally, we controlled for study
 enrolment wave and birth season (for the linear growth
 outcomes) and season of measurement (for the serum
 AF outcome). Following the CONSORT guidelines, we
 also present impact analyses unadjusted for socioeco-
 nomic covariates (these estimates do control for biolog-
 ical covariates such as child age and sex).
 Two types of sensitivity analyses were conducted for
 the primary outcome analyses. To assess the importance
 of observations lost to follow-up, we estimated the prob-
 ability of dropout using an augmented set of baseline
 variables (ie, the covariates included in the impact model
 and a number of other variables possibly related to loss
 to follow-up). The predicted linear probability (ie, the 
<section> predicted log odds) was then added as a covariate to
 the regression model used to estimate the impact of the
 intervention. Second, we used multiple imputation to fill
 in missing values for observations that did not dropout,
 but had some missing information. Sequential imputa-
 tion using chained equations (Stata’s mi command) was
 used. Once values were imputed, the impact regression
 model was estimated. The standard errors in all analyses
 were adjusted for the (potential) lack of independence
 between observations in the same village. A p value of
 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Given the
 clear a priori hypothesis of the trial, and in line with the
 sample size calculation and data analysis plan, one-sided
 tests were used to assess the significance of the interven-
 tion on all outcomes.
 In addition to the analyses to assess the impact of the
 intervention, we present additional exploratory analyses
 as online supporting material to help with the interpreta-
 tion of the findings. These include changes over time in
 mothers’ serum AFB1-lysine adduct level at enrolment,
 control group children’s serum AFB1-lysine adduct level
 at endline and the proportion of households with maize
 samples above the 10 ppb AF testing threshold.

 ciation's registry for randomised controlled trials as
 AEARCTR-0000105 on November 6, 2013 and updated in
 2014 to reflect the addition of the stockist intervention,

<section> Results
 
<section> Enrolment exceeded the minimum sample size indi-
 cated by power calculations due to higher than expected
 fertility rates in the study villages (figure 2). This was
 offset by higher than expected loss to follow-up. Of
 the 1219 (687 intervention, 532 control) unborn chil-
 dren enrolled in the study, 881 (72%) were included in
 the LAZ and 798 (65%) in the serum AFB analysis. A
 1
 total of 251 (148 intervention, 118 control) were lost to
 follow-up; an additional 72 children (50 intervention,
 control) and 155 children (103 intervention, 52 control)
 had incomplete data for the LAZ and AFB analyses at
 endline, respectively. The discrepancy in completeness of
 follow-up data between intervention and control groups
 was driven by very low rates of interview completion in

 The exploratory analyses online supplementary figure

 to a spike in the proportion of households in treatment

 with contaminated maize and serum lys-AFB levels are
 considerably lower. Child serum AFB -lysine adduct levels

<section> Discussion
 
<section> This study, carried out in Eastern Kenya, is the first
 cluster randomised controlled trial to test whether AF
 exposure stunts child linear growth. Reducing AF expo-
 sure through a swapping and stockist intervention signif-
 icantly lowered serum AF levels: at study endline (24
 months after study enrolment during pregnancy), chil-
 dren in intervention communities had serum AF levels
 that were 27% lower than in the control communities.
 The intervention, however, did not improve child linear
 growth at this prespecified study endline.
 The effect on serum AF indicates that the lack of impact
 on growth is not a consequence of a failure to reduce AF
 exposure. In addition, AF exposure levels were similar
 or higher than those in previous observational studies
 documenting associations between AF and child linear
 growth. 6 8 25 Serum AF levels in pregnant women at enrol-
 ment waves 2 to 4 (June 2013 through February 2014)
 ranged from 3.8 to 8.4 pg/mg albumin (online supple-
 mentary figure 1), similar to those reported by Turner
 et al in pregnant women (5.3 pg/mg after adjusting for
 the factors published by McCoy to account for different
 analytical methods). 6 25 During the final two enrolment
 waves for pregnant women (June and November 2014),
 however, exposure levels were considerably higher
 (the geometric mean of AFB -lysine adduct levels were
 between 35 and 40 pg/mg). Levels of AF detected in the
 intervention households’ stored maize followed a similar
 pattern. From September 2013 to May 2014, a period
 that spans the first three enrolment waves included in
 the study, the mean proportion of households who had
 maize in store that tested over 10 ppb (the Kenyan regu-
 latory threshold) was 4.6% (N=1163), and the geometric
 mean contamination in a subsample of those exceeding
 10 ppb was 36.7 ppb (N=48). From June to November
 2014, when the last two waves were enrolled, 19.5% of
 maize samples tested above 10 ppb (N=1668), and the
 geometric mean among a random subset from those over
 10 ppb was 563 ppb (N=51). This is much higher than
 levels typically observed in studies documenting crop AF
 prevalence. 26 27 The levels in children at endline (4.5 to
 8.3 pg/mg, August 2015 through October 2016) were
 comparable to those reported by Gong et al in children
 16 to 37 months of age (geometric mean 4.3 pg/mg,
 after adjustment using McCoy et al). 8
 A strength of our study is its design: it is the first to
 use a randomised trial to study the effects of reducing AF
 exposure. A key limitation (inherent to this type of study)
 is the different nature of our two primary outcomes:
 the effect of environmental insults on linear growth is
 cumulative and takes many months (or years) to become
 observable. Serum AFB -lysine adduct reflects exposure
 to AF in the past 3 months. The different response time
 of the two outcome variables and the known seasonal
 variation in AF exposure online supplementary figure
 1 may explain the apparent paradox in the findings
 at endline (reduction in serum AF levels; no effect on
 growth) and midline (no effect on serum levels; effect on
 growth). By-wave analysis of the impact of the interven-
 tion on serum AF levels (online supplementary table 4)
 shows that the impact of the intervention was limited to 
<section> endline waves 5 and 6, when serum AF was highest in the
 control group children. This suggests that AF exposure
 during the other waves of data collection may have been
 too low for a reduction to be detected.
 As a consequence of the difference in response time
 and seasonal variation, linking (reductions in) exposure
 to (improvements in) linear growth is challenging. Ideally,
 this would entail quarterly monitoring of serum AFB -ly-
 sine adduct, which was cost prohibitive for this study.
 The biological pathways that might explain the effect of
 AF exposure on linear growth are poorly understood:
 environmental enteric dysfunction, immunomodula-
 tion and changes in the hepatic metabolism of micronu-
 trients have been proposed as possible mechanisms. 4
 We did not collect biomarkers for any of these. Another
 limitation is the loss to follow-up in the study, which was
 relatively high. Our sensitivity analyses, however, do not
 suggest that this changed our results.
 The midline growth effect (secondary outcome) leads
 to important questions regarding the toxicity of AF for
 growth. The intervention appears to have had a large
 positive growth effect when these children were on
 average around 13 months old. No effect was found on
 serum AF levels at midline, which were relatively low in
 control group children at this time. The growth effect,
 however, was no longer observed in the same children
 (ie, children enrolled in waves 4, 5 and 6) at endline.
 To ensure that this finding was not due to differential
 dropout between midline and endline, we re-estimated
 the growth effects on a homogenous sample of children
 present at both time points and found that the results did
 not change (online supplementary table 5). The large
 effect at midline combined with the absence of an effect
 at endline indicate that the toxic effect of AF might vary by
 age. Our findings suggest that protection from the 2014
 AF spike early in life (ie, in utero or at very young ages, as
 was the case for wave 4, 5 and 6 children) was particularly
 beneficial (online supplementary figure 1). The disap-
 pearance of the impact between midline and endline
 could indicate that the relative (biological) importance
 of AF exposure as an inhibitor of linear growth decreases
 as children grow older. Larger reductions in AF exposure
 may also have been needed to result in a (continued)
 effect on linear growth. In addition, children’s nutrient
 intake between midline and endline might have been too
 deficient to sustain the growth advantage the children
 had accumulated by midline. These factors may have
 resulted in children regressing to the status of the chil-
 dren in the control group. Unfortunately, we do not have
 the necessary data to further explore these hypothesised
 pathways. Finally, the disappearance of the linear growth
 impact does not imply that the intervention did not
 confer other potentially permanent benefits to the chil-
 dren in the intervention group, such as improvements in
 neurocognitive development and immune function.
 The study confirms that exposure to AF can be substan-
 tially reduced through interventions (supplemental text
 on the uptake of the intervention). Given the complexity
 and cost of organising regular swapping and the stockist
 approach, the intervention tested here is not feasible
 for implementation at scale. Other solutions, however,
 are available. A postharvest intervention was shown to
 substantially reduce serum AF levels in Guinea. 26 Aflasafe,
 which inoculates the soil with non-toxicogenic Aspergillus
 strains, can be used in large scale programme.
 Our findings have implications for future studies and
 public health. First, as found in this study, AF exposure
 varies considerably over space and time. This means that
 the potential benefit of interventions aimed at reducing
 AF exposure is to a large extent outside the control of
 the researchers. Studies in multiple locations, during
 different seasons and for varying time periods will thus be
 needed to answer the AF-stunting question definitively.
 Second, our findings suggest that AF’s effect on growth
 may vary with age. Future studies should explore these
 age-varying effects. Third, even if future studies find no
 effect of AF on linear growth, research should focus on
 better understanding the (hypothesised) effects of AF
 exposure on environmental enteric dysfunction, systemic
 inflammation, immunomodulation and changes in the
 hepatic metabolism of micronutrients. 4 28 Several of these
 pathways are likely to affect other critical outcomes, such
 as child health and development.
 Finally, it must be noted that there are multiple bene-
 fits to AF control, which include agricultural productivity,
 access to domestic and export markets and health. Deci-
 sions about AF control should assess the joint benefits
 and not be limited to the potential effect on child linear
 growth.
