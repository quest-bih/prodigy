<section> Introduction
 Tuberculosis is one of the most common chronic
 infectious diseases in the world: in 2018, an estimated
 10 million people had tuberculosis and around
 1·5 million deaths were attributed to the disease.
 In 2017, about 85% of tuberculosis deaths occurred in
 Africa and southeast Asia where the prevalence of
 smoking is high. 1 In the absence of smoking cessation
 services to treat nicotine dependence, the general
 population in these regions remain at risk of premature
 death and disabilities due to smoking. Assuming that
 the relative prevalence of smoking and tuberculosis
 remain stable, it is estimated that more than 40 million
 potentially avoidable tuberculosis-related deaths will be

 access to health services and each contact with these

 integration of smoking cessation interventions within
 national and regional tuberculosis services in LMICs
 offers a viable solution to reduce the tuberculosis and
 tobacco-related disease burden.
 A tuberculosis treatment period of at least 6 months
 offers opportunities for health-care professionals to

 the addition of bupropion to the behavioural support

<section> tuberculosis because of concerns about their illness
 and associated consequences. 4 By reducing the risk of
 tuberculosis relapses and deaths and by preventing other
 tobacco-related chronic conditions, the potential health
 benefits of smoking cessation might be even higher
 among patients with tuberculosis than among smokers
 in the general population. 5 Offering smoking cessation
 interventions to patients with tubercu losis should be
 routine and has been shown to be feasible in many
 contexts, although such interventions are rarely provided
 in LMICs. 6,7 The scarcity of low-cost, effective, and safe
 smoking cessation treatment options in patients with
 tuberculosis, in addition to several other barriers, is

<section> 8,9
 Individual counselling, alone and in combination with
 pharmacotherapy, is an effective strategy for smoking
 cessation. 10 In our previous trial of 1955 patients attending
 tuberculosis clinics in Pakistan, we found that two-fifths
 of smokers attained continuous abstinence at 6 months
 with behavioural support offered by health professionals.
 However, the challenges of delivering 30–40 min of
 behavioural support within routine tuberculosis care
 including resource constraints, 9 led to the development of
 a shorter optimised behavioural support intervention.
 In addition to the provision of behavioural support,
 substantial evidence indicates that nicotine replacement
 therapy and treatment with nicotine receptor partial
 investigating the effect of cytisine for smoking cessation in
 such patients.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 We recruited a large sample of patients with tuberculosis in
 Bangladesh and Pakistan to assess the effectiveness of cytisine
 with behavioural support for smoking cessation compared with
 behavioural support alone. To the best of our knowledge, this is
 the largest trial of cytisine for smoking cessation to date, and it
 is the first such trial to be done across two countries. Although
 the proportion of patients who achieved abstinence at
 6 months was high in both groups, cytisine had no clinically or
 statistically significant advantage for smoking cessation when
 added to behavioural support in patients with tuberculosis.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 When offered behavioural support, a large proportion of
 patients with tuberculosis quit smoking, often more readily
 than general smokers. Patients who stop smoking are also
 more likely to recover from tuberculosis than those who do not.
 Compelling evidence supports advising and counselling
 patients with tuberculosis to quit smoking. However, current
 evidence does not support supplementation of behavioural
 support with pharmacological treatment in patients with
 tuberculosis. More research on strategies for the
 implementation of behavioural support for smoking cessation
 in routine tuberculosis care in LMICs is needed.
 
<section> agonists (bupropion, cytisine, and varenicline) are effec-
 tive strategies to aid smoking cessation in the general
 population. 11 The plant-based alkaloid cytisine is recom-
 mended as an affordable intervention, especially for
 LMICs. 12 The cost of cytisine is five to ten times lower
 than nicotine replacement therapy and varenicline, and
 has been found to be effective in moderate-to-heavy
 smokers. 12 However, the effectiveness of cytisine in
 patients with tuberculosis in LMICs remains unknown.
 We aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of
 cytisine when given in combination with brief behavioural
 support in patients with tuberculosis in Bangladesh and
 Pakistan.
 
<section> Methods
 Study design and participants
 We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
 trial at 32 health centres in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Sites
 were designated tuberculosis treatment centres run by the
 national tuberculosis control programmes of Bangladesh
 and Pakistan and were chosen on the basis of having the
 required resources and ability to recruit participants and
 take part in the research. The sites were 17 subdistrict
 hospitals in Bangladesh and 15 secondary care hospitals
 in Pakistan located in urban and rural areas.
 Eligible patients were adults (aged >18 years in
 Bangladesh; aged >15 years in Pakistan, defined per the

<section> www.desmoxan.pl who reported any moderate-to-severe symptoms were

 whether the event was associated with study treatment.
 The country coordinating office was notified of all serious
 adverse events within 24 h of site researchers becoming
 aware of an event, who in turn notified the York trial
 team within 24 h. Medically qualified staff at the country
 coordinating centres confirmed the causality and
 expectedness of events, and classified adverse events
 according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
 Activities (MedDRA).
 Data were initially collected on paper case report forms
 and then checked and entered at the country level
 through a web interface into a central trial database with
 inbuilt validation rules, hosted by York Trials Unit.
 Data were extracted periodically by the trial statisticians
 for the purpose of trial coordination and reporting to
 the independent oversight committees. Queries were
 resolved with country trial teams on an ongoing basis.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 On the basis of cessation rates reported in previous
 trials, 7,19 assuming an attrition rate of 10%, we calculated
 that a sample size of 1074 patients in the cytisine group
 and 1074 patients in the placebo group would provide
 80% power to detect a 6% difference in the proportion of
 patients who had achieved continuous abstinence rates
 at 6 months between cytisine and placebo groups. Thus,
 we aimed to recruit 1194 patients in each group.
 The number and proportion of abstinent participants
 were reported by treatment group. The between-group
 difference was presented as the risk difference and
 relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs. A p value for the effect of
 allocation was derived using logistic regression, with trial
 sites included as random-effects using robust SEs.
 Missing primary outcome data were treated as a negative
 outcome (ie, not abstinent). Any primary outcome data
 collected more than 4 weeks before or after the 6-month
 follow-up were also treated as a negative outcome.
 Secondary outcomes were analysed in the same manner.
 Since a carbon monoxide cutoff of less than 10 ppm
 was used for biochemical verification of self-reports of
 abstinence, participants reporting continuous abstinence
 at 6 months post-randomisation with a carbon monoxide
 reading of 10 ppm or more, could not be verified. We
 regarded these participants as not abstinent; their high
 carbon monoxide reading indicated that they were most
 likely still smoking despite reporting abstinence.
 Continuous tuberculosis outcomes and nicotine
 dependency were analysed using linear mixed-effect
 regression models for all available timepoints. The
 number of adverse events (serious and non-serious),
 patients with any adverse event, and adverse events per
 patient in the two groups was compared using a χ² test.
 Adherence to study medication was categorised as
 good (≥80%), moderate (≥50%) and poor (<50%), 13 on the
 basis of the number of days participants self-reported to
 have taken medications as prescribed.
 The costs of treatment for behavioural support and trial
 medications were collected in local currencies and
 converted to purchasing power parity (PPP) to pool the
 results across the two countries. Placebo medications
 were considered at zero cost. Costs were presented as
 purchasing power parity US$ (PPP US$) 2017 values.
 Missing values were imputed using multiple imputation.
 The imputation model included other health-care costs
 and quality of life for economic evaluation, which will be
 reported elsewhere.
 All prespecified primary, secondary and safety analyses
 were done by intention to treat whereby patients were
 analysed according to their allocated treatment group
 regardless of their compliance with the study drug
 schedule. Two-sided p values of less than 0·05 were
 considered to indicate statistical significance. All statis-
 tical analysis were done using Stata (version 16.0).
 This trial is registered with the International Standard
 Randomised Clinical Trial Registry, ISRCTN43811467.

<section> Results
 
<section> Between June 6, 2017, and April 30, 2018, of 13 934 (18%)
 patients with tuberculosis assessed, 2472 patients
 (1527 patients from Bangladesh; 945 patients from
 Pakistan) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive
 behavioural support plus either cytisine (n=1239) or
 placebo (n=1233; figure; appendix 3 p 12). 11 462 (82%)
 patients with tuberculosis were excluded, predominantly
 because they were not daily smokers. Of the 2472 patients
 enrolled, 1142 (92%) of 1239 patients in the cytisine group
 and 1130 (92%) of 1233 patients in the placebo group
 completed the 6-month follow-up assessment (figure).
 Baseline characteristics were balanced between the
 two treatment groups (table 1). Most participants were
 men (2448 [99%] of 2472 patients) and had smoked a
 mean of 11·1 cigarettes per day (SD 8·6) for the previous
 23 years, with a quarter reporting they had previously
 attempted to quit.
 At 6 months, 675 (54·5%) of 1239 participants in the
 cytisine group and 644 (52·2%) of 1233 participants in the

<section> had no additional benefit for smoking cessation in
 patients with tuberculosis. The risk difference in
 6-month continuous abstinence rates between the
 two treatment groups (2·68%) was less than the
 difference of 6% that would represent a clinically
 significant difference. Moreover, the observed risk
 difference was not statistically significant, although the
 upper limit of the 95% CI was above 6%. This finding
 was consistent across all secondary tobacco cessation
 outcomes. The number of adverse events were balanced
 between the two groups. No serious adverse events were
 attributed to study medication, and cytisine seemed
 to be well-tolerated. The proportion of patients with
 available data for continuous abstinence (92%) was high
 and similar in both groups.
 A 2018 meta-analysis of all cytisine trials (n=4216;
 sample size range 150–1214) showed that smoking
 cessation rates among patients given cytisine improved
 by 75% compared with patients given placebo. 12 Add-
 itionally, a non-inferiority trial found cytisine to be more
 effective than nicotine replacement therapy. 20 However,
 the absolute difference in cessation rates between
 cytisine and placebo in our trial was lower than that
 reported in previous trials, possibly due to certain
 contextual and population differences. In subgroup
 analyses, a non-significant difference in cessation rates
 in favour of cytisine was noted in those who smoked
 exclusively (34% in the cytisine group vs 31% in the
 placebo group). By contrast to our trial, previous trials
 recruited healthy participants. The participants included
 in our study were recently diagnosed with pulmonary
 tuberculosis and, as part of behavioural support, learned
 about the association between smoking and their
 condition. The proportion of patients in the placebo
 group who met the primary endpoint (29·7%) indicates
 that the participants had a strong motivation to quit.
 In our previous trial of patients presenting with
 tuberculosis symptoms, 41% of participants achieved
 abstinence by 6 months with behavioural support;
 however, the sessions were longer in duration
 (30–45 min) than those in the current study. This
 difference in intrinsic motivation between specific
 groups and the general population is also exemplified
 during pregnancy when high quit rates are achieved
 with behavioural support alone. 21 Another key difference
 between our participants and those included in the
 previous cytisine trials is the extent of nicotine addiction.
 The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day in
 previous cytisine trials were higher (19·3 cigarettes per
 day [SD 11·9]; 20 23·0 cigarettes per day [8·7] ) than in
 our trial (11·1 cigarettes per day [8·1]). Generally, heavy
 smokers with high nicotine dependence are more
 likely to benefit from medication 23 by attenuating
 their withdrawal symptoms than are light smokers.
 However, the proportion of participants in Pakistan
 (who smoked a mean 12·9 cigarettes per day) who had
 achieved abstinence by 6 months (33% in the cystine
 group vs 27% in the placebo group) did not signifi-
 cantly differ from the proportion in Bangladesh
 (mean 9·8 cigarettes per day; 32% achieved abstinence
 in the cystine group vs 31% achieved abstinence in the
 placebo group). Moreover, our pragmatic trial was done
 in clinical settings where some loss of effectiveness is
 expected when compared with explanatory trials.
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest trial of
 cytisine for smoking cessation to date, and is the first
 such trial to be done across two countries. Bangladesh
 and Pakistan were selected because of existing partner-
 ships with academics and tuberculosis programmes,
 local knowledge, and previous experience of doing trials
 in these countries. With the exception of a small trial
 (n=171) in Kyrgyzstan, 24 this is the first trial of cytisine
 and one of the few smoking cessation trials to be done in
 LMIC settings. Other strengths of this study were the
 rigor and quality with which the trial was done and
 the assessment of abstinence at 12 months, which
 represents a longer follow-up than is usually done in
 smoking cessation trials, and tubercu losis outcomes.
 Approximately, 42% of participants who self-reported
 continuous abstinence at 6 months could not be verified
 biochemically. This finding is consistent with the
 accuracy of self-report from other smoking cessation
 clinical trials 25 and our previous trial in patients
 suspected to have tuberculosis in Pakistan, where about
 half (49%) of the self-reports could be biochemically
 validated. This difference could be explained by multiple
 factors including social desirability in response to
 participation in a smoking cessation trial or wanting to
 avoid stigma that might be associated with continued
 smoking considering that it will worsen tuberculosis
 outcomes, 25 and poor air quality that is likely to be a
 contributor to higher carbon monoxide levels than the
 cutoff used.
 Our trial had some limitations. First, our assessment
 of adherence to the trial medication was self-reported.
 Considering the complexity of the cytisine dosing
 schedule and anti-tuberculosis comedication, adherence
 to study medication might have been lower than
 reported. Although a lower level of adherence would
 not influence the difference between the cytisine and
 placebo groups, it might have resulted in a lower
 proportion of patients achieving abstinence across the
 two groups. Second, the stability and pharmacovigilance
 of cytisine have not yet been assessed in non-European
 climates. Although we ensured medication storage
 conditions were within the manufacturer’s recom men-
 dations, exposures to high temperatures or humidity
 might have led to instability and loss of efficacy.
 Third, our trial was not powered to detect differences
 in secondary tuberculosis outcomes or for subgroup
 analysis. Fourth, only a small number of women were
 recruited, which might limit the generalisability of our
 findings; however, this is likely to be due to low smoking
 prevalence among women in south Asia and might also
