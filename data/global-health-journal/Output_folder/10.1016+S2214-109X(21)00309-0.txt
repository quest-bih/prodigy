<section> Evidence before this study
 In the absence of a more effective vaccine for tuberculosis there is
 renewed interest in BCG vaccination and revaccination. Two large
 trials, in Malawi and Brazil, have reported no overall protection
 against tuberculosis by repeat BCG. However, a trial in South
 Africa suggested protection against persistent infection.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 This extended follow-up of the Malawi repeat BCG trial greatly
 increased the power of the study and allowed investigation by
 subgroup. The lack of overall protection was confirmed, but
 there were suggestions of delayed protection in those
 vaccinated as children, among those who were HIV negative,
 developed tuberculosis in the repeat BCG versus placebo
 groups of the trial, which allows us to explore patterns by
 time and to test several hypotheses drawn from the
 tuberculosis literature.
 Experience with primary BCG vaccination led us to
 expect that vaccine efficacy would be greater in those who
 were younger at repeat vaccination. 6,9–11 Those vaccinated
 as young children would have been relatively naive of
 mycobacterial exposure and in the age range of relatively
 low tuberculosis incidence at the time of the previous
 analysis. We expected vaccine efficacy to be higher in
 those who were tuberculin skin test (TST) negative at
 repeat vaccination. 2,9 We collected data on tuberculin
 reactivity for a subset of the population, but this has not
 been explored in the trial until now. It has been suggested
 that vaccine efficacy might vary by M tuberculosis
 lineage: 12,13 we have genetic sequence data on a high
 proportion of the M tuberculosis isolates, including all four
 major lineages. We expected greater protection against
 extrapulmonary than against pulmonary tuberculosis.
 We expected greater protection in HIV-negative indi­
 viduals. In our previous analysis there was some
 evidence that repeat BCG actually increased the risk
 for HIV-positive tuberculosis. Numbers were small but
 it is important to assess this possibility. Vaccine trials
 for tuberculosis have been restricted to HIV-negative
 individuals. 2,14 Although we expected waning vaccine
 efficacy with time, studies from countries where BCG is
 protective show evidence of protection for at least 20 years
 
<section> after vaccination.

<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> This was a 30-year follow-up of a large, randomised,
 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The background,
 design, and methods of the Karonga Prevention Trial in
 northern Malawi have been described in detail. 16,17
 The trial involved both BCG scar-negative and
 scar-positive individuals and evaluated vaccination with
 BCG and with a combined vaccine composed of BCG
 and against extrapulmonary disease. There was no difference in
 protection by tuberculin sensitivity at baseline, or by
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 The patterns by age and time are consistent with those in Brazil
 for repeat BCG, and in south India for first BCG. However, any
 protection was weak, and these results support WHO’s policy
 not to recommend repeat BCG. Development of a more
 effective vaccine against tuberculosis remains a high priority
 challenge for research. Patterns revealed in this long-term
 follow-up should be considered in future evaluations of
 mycobacterial vaccines.
 
<section> plus killed M leprae, with endpoints of tuberculosis and
 leprosy. BCG scar-negative individuals received either
 BCG alone, or BCG plus killed M leprae at two different
 doses. BCG scar-positive individuals received BCG alone,
 placebo, or BCG plus killed M leprae (figure 1). In this
 report, we concentrate on the effect of repeat BCG, and
 therefore on the comparison of BCG alone versus
 placebo in those who were scar-positive at recruitment.
 We emphasise tuberculosis, since there were few further
 cases of leprosy after the initial analysis. Additional
 results on all vaccine combinations, and both diseases,
 are shown in the appendix. The protocol was approved by
 the Health Sciences Research Committee of the Malawi
 Ministry of Health, the Standing Committee on Research
 in Human Subjects of WHO, and the Ethics Committee
 of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
 The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry,
 ISRCTN11311670.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> Virtually the entire population of Karonga District (a
 small area in the south was excluded), a rural area in
 northern Malawi, was surveyed between Jan 9, 1986, and
 Oct 28, 1989, by field teams of trained interviewers,
 paramedical leprosy control assistants and vaccinators,
 who visited households systematically. All individuals
 were questioned about cough, with sputum collection
 from all reporting a chronic cough or haemoptysis, and
 were examined for leprosy. Eligible individuals (over
 3 months of age and born after 1913, with no evidence of
 tuberculosis, leprosy, or other serious disease) were
 invited to participate in the trial, and any reason for
 exclusion or refusal was recorded. Individuals born
 before 1914 could request to be included.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 Individuals were randomly assigned to a vaccine
 depending on their scar status, with individuals with
 doubtful scar status considered as scar positive. Identical
 ten-dose vials containing the different trial vaccines were

 At the time of recruitment, all participants in selected
 areas of the district were skin tested with tuberculin
 (RT23, 2IU). 18 Skin tests were placed on the volar surface
 of a forearm (side recorded) and read 48–72 h later, with
 induration diameters recorded along and across the
 arm. Average induration diameter was used in all
 analyses.
 Follow-up of the trial population for tuberculosis
 and leprosy outcomes was by a mixture of active and
 enhanced passive surveillance, and continued until
 Dec 31, 2018. The active component included house-to-
 house surveys in four areas of the district, each with
 5000–10 000 population, done in 1991–94. In addition, all
 individuals known to be first-degree relatives, or to have
 lived in the household, of a known patient with leprosy
 since 1980 were traced and examined in 1995. As part of
 the routine procedures for all studies in the district,
 including the baseline census for a demographic
 surveillance site in 2002–04, covering 19 471 (16%) of
 121 267 of the trial population, participants were asked
 about chronic cough, and specimens taken if indicated. 19,20
 All participants living in the demographic surveillance
 site area have been followed up regularly. In addition,
 until 2007, project staff were stationed at health centres
 in the district to screen all attendees for chronic cough
 and skin lesions. 19 Since 2007, with the exception of
 regular follow-up of those in the demographic
 surveillance population, surveillance has relied on
 self-reporting to the district health services.
 All individuals with suspected tuberculosis or leprosy,
 regardless of how they were initially detected, were seen
 by project staff, in conjunction with the National
 Tuberculosis Programme, and specimens were processed
 in the project laboratory. Sputum samples were examined
 by fluorescence microscopy and cultured on acidified
 Lowenstein-Jensen medium with or without pyruvate.
 GeneXpert (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) has been
 available at the district hospital since 2013. Positive
 cultures with growth macroscopically consistent with
 mycobacteria were sent to the UK Public Health
 Laboratory Service–Public Health England Mycobacterial
 Reference Laboratory for species confirmation, and
 biopsy specimens were sent to a histopathologist in the
 UK. 19 All available M tuberculosis isolates up to 2014
 were genotyped by means of spoligotyping, restriction
 fragment length polymorphism, or whole genome
 sequencing, including stored samples back to 1986. 20–23
 Individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis and older than
 15 years were tested for HIV, after counselling, and if
 consent was given. HIV serology was carried out by
 ELISA (HIV-1–HIV-2) and particle agglutination assays
 and in later years by parallel rapid tests in line with
 the national testing strategy; serum samples with
 inconsistent results were tested by additional methods.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was considered
 certain if culture, GeneXpert, or genotyping showed
 
<section> M tuberculosis, with at least one other specimen positive
 on culture, GeneXpert, genotyping, or microscopy. The
 diagnosis was considered probable if culture, GeneXpert,
 genotyping, or microscopy was positive but not fulfilling
 the criteria for certainty, and excluding those with only a
 single scanty sputum smear (ie, fewer than ten bacilli
 per 100 fields). Smears for which the corresponding
 culture or genotype showed non-tuberculous mycobacteria
 were excluded. A diagnosis of extrapulmonary disease was
 considered certain if the histology was certain or an
 aspirate was positive on culture, GeneXpert, genotyping,
 or microscopy (excluding any single scanty smears), and
 probable if histology was probable or the aspirate had only
 a scanty positive smear.
 Anyone with self-reported or documentary evidence of
 diagnosed tuberculosis before vaccination was excluded
 from the analysis for tuberculosis outcomes. Tuberculosis
 cases arising in the first 6 months (182 days) after
 vaccination were excluded to ensure onset was post-
 vaccination. Only the first episode of certain or probable
 tuberculosis post-vaccination was considered in the
 analysis.
 Diagnostic criteria for leprosy were based on an
 algorithm incorporating all clinical and histopathological
 data (see appendix p 17).
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 The main analysis examined the efficacy of repeat BCG
 (BCG versus placebo among scar-positives), with
 diagnostically certain and probable tuberculosis as the
 endpoint. This included all tuberculosis cases and then
 considered pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis
 separately. We prespecified subgroup analyses for
 pulmonary tuberculosis, by TST status at vaccination
 (<5 mm, 5–16 mm, ≥17 mm), by age at vaccination
 (<5 years, 5–14 years, 15–24 years, ≥25 years), and by time
 since vaccination (<10 years, 10–19 years, ≥20 years). We
 also prespecified analyses by HIV status at diagnosis
 (negative, positive and on antiretrovirals for <3 months,
 positive and on antiretrovirals for ≥3 months) and (for all
 tuberculosis) by M tuberculosis lineage.
 In the 1995 analysis, incidence rates were calculated
 with person-years denominators. Given the length of
 the follow-up, more than half the trial population are
 now likely to have died or left the district, so incidence
 rates cannot be used. However, follow-up by vaccine
 group should not be biased. This was tested formally
 for that portion of the trial population in the demo­
 graphic surveillance area and showed no evidence of
 differential mortality or emigration between vaccine
 groups (appendix p 3). The analyses therefore use
 logistic regression, adjusting for vaccine batch (where
 possible), and we report odds ratios (ORs) with their
 associated 95% CIs, and two-sided p values, from the 
<insert> in figure 2. The OR for all certain and probable
 tuberculosis was 0·92 (95% CI 0·80–1·05). It was 0·93
 (0·81–1·07) for pulmonary tuberculosis alone, and 0·60
 (0·31–1·17) for lymph node tuberculosis. Only one

<section> CI) The protective effect of repeat BCG on pulmonary
 tuberculosis was only seen in those vaccinated at
 younger than 15 years, and followed up for at least
 20 years (figure 3). Separating the analyses by HIV status
 (figure 4) reveals lower ORs (further from 1) among
 
<section> (0·46–1·89) HIV-negative individuals for all subgroups, with the
 
<section> (0·84–1·63) exception of those with tuberculin reactivity of less than

<section> (0·76–1·29) individuals (0·52 [0·31–0·88]).
 
<section> (0·47–0·90) For the per-protocol analysis, 3888 individuals (60 of
 
<section> (0·73–1·53) whom developed tuberculosis) were excluded, mostly
 due to doubtful scar status (details in appendix p 9). The
 OR for all tuberculosis was 0·87 (0·76–1·01) and 0·88
 
<section> risk (0·76–1·02) for pulmonary tuberculosis (appendix p 14).
 The results by TST status, age, years since vaccination,
 HIV status, and lineage were similar to the main analysis.
 When the outcome was changed to diagnostically
 certain tuberculosis, the ORs were 0·95 (0·80–1·13) for
 all tuberculosis (538 cases) and 0·98 (0·82–1·17) for
 pulmonary tuberculosis (503 cases) in the intention-to-

 randomised, placebo-controlled trial of repeat BCG in
 
<section> (0·53–1·00) Karonga District, Malawi, we found no evidence of
 
<section> (0·83–1·41) protection against pulmonary tuberculosis overall, and

<section> (0·26–1·83) We hypothesised that there might be more protection
 in those vaccinated as children because they would have
 been less exposed to tuberculosis and to the mycobacterial

<section> recent decades). 29 In the Karonga context this decline has
 been evident since 1980. It is likely to have been
 influenced by the control programme introduced into
 the population by the British Leprosy Relief Association
 (Lepra) in 1974, and aggressive case finding and
 treatment within the context of two total population
 surveys by the Lepra Evaluation Project in the 1980s. 17,30
 Beyond that, the decline was also encouraged by the
 introduction of BCG within the Expanded Programme
 on Immunisation in the late 1970s and the fact that the
 Karonga Prevention Trial ensured that almost everyone

<section> DATA.00002443 fact have received the most intensive leprosy control
 efforts of any leprosy endemic population in the world,
 with the evident result that the incidence has been
 reduced to near zero.
 The Karonga trial recruited without restriction by age
 or previous TST status because an important motive was
 to evaluate protection by repeating a BCG vaccination
 against disease in all ages; and it was planned and
 initiated before HIV was known in the population.
 The identification procedures established more than
 40 years ago have allowed individuals with diagnosed
 tuberculosis and leprosy in the district to continue to be
 linked reliably to the trial population. 30 All project staff
 remained masked to the interventions throughout the
 follow-up. Passive follow-up means that the incidence of
 tuberculosis and leprosy is doubtless underestimated.
 But as the vaccine groups were randomly assigned, this
 should not introduce bias into the relative risks reported
 here. The data from the demographic surveillance area
 within the district confirm that there was no differential
 mortality or emigration from the area by vaccine group
 (appendix p 3). We thus present these analyses in
 considerable detail, here and in the appendix, as this
 long and detailed follow-up provides a unique resource
 for the continued effort to develop and evaluate
 mycobacterial vaccines.
 In conclusion, we find no evidence of a strong protective
 effect of repeat BCG on all tuberculosis in this rural
 African population, with a high prevalence of HIV, but a
 suggestion of modest protection against HIV-negative
 tuberculosis, and of protection when the second vaccine
 was given in childhood. Protection against leprosy was
 strongest in individuals without tuberculin reactivity at
 time of vaccination, but appeared to decline by 10 years
 post-vaccination. These patterns, based on the longest
 detailed follow-up of a mycobacteria vaccine trial to date,
 are consistent with much that is known about BCG and
 cumulative exposure to mycobacterial antigens, from
 trials and observational studies, and should be considered
 in the planning, analysis, and interpretation of future
 mycobacterial vaccine trials.
