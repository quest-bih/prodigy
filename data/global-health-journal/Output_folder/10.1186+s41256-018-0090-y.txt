<section> Abstract
 
<section> Background: The National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) was introduced in Ghana in 2003, enrolment is still far
 from the desired target of universal coverage. Low community engagement in the design and management of the
 system was identified as one of the main barriers. The aim of the current study was to explore the role of social
 capital in NHIS enrolment in two regions of Ghana, Western and Greater Accra.
 
<section> Methods: The study involved a cluster-randomised controlled trial of 3246 clients of 64 healthcare facilities who
 completed both a baseline and a follow-up survey. Thirty-two facilities were randomly selected to receive two types
 of intervention. The remaining facilities served as control. The interventions were co-designed with stakeholders.
 Baseline and follow up surveys included measures of different types of social capital, as well as enrolment in the
 health insurance scheme.
 
<section> Results: The study found that the interventions encouraged NHIS enrolment (from 40.29 to 49.39% (intervention group)
 versus 36.49 to 36.75% (control group)). Secondly, certain types of social capital are associated with increased enrolment
 (log-odds ratios (p-values) of three types of vertical social capital are 0.127 (< 0.01), 0.0952 (< 0.1) and 0.15 (< 0.01)).
 Effectiveness of the interventions was found dependent on initial levels of social capital: respondents with
 lowest measured level of interpersonal trust in the intervention group were about 25% more likely to be
 insured than similar respondents in the control group. Among highly trusting respondents this difference was
 insignificant. There was however no evidence that the interventions effect social capital. Limitations of the
 study are discussed.
 
<section> Conclusion: We showed that the interventions helped to increase enrolment but that the positive effect was
 not realized by changes in social capital that we hypothesised based on result of the first phase of our study.
 Future research should aim to identify other community factors that are part of the enrolment process, whether other
 interventions to improve the quality of services could help to increase enrolment and, as a result, could provide
 community benefits in terms of social capital.
 Our findings can guide the NHIS in Ghana and other health organizations to enhance enrolment.

<section> Introduction
 Ghana introduced the National Health Insurance
 Scheme (NHIS) in 2003 to improve access to universal
 quality healthcare. It replaced a cash and carry system
 that required upfront payment from individuals at the
 point of service usage. Membership of the NHIS provide
 access to health services from both credentialed public
 and private healthcare providers throughout the country,
 and are financially covered for about 95% of Ghana’s
 health problems. Members pay an annual premium for
 active membership unless they fall under one of several
 exemption categories [1]. The scheme increased the
 number of people with access to health insurance, but
 enrolment levels have stayed well below the desired uni-
 versal coverage target. A decade after its implementa-
 tion, only about 34% of Ghana’s population were active
 card bearing members [2–4]. Several barriers to enrol-
 ment have been identified, relating to the scheme’s af-
 fordability, the supply of NHIS membership cards, poor
 attitudes of healthcare staff, perceived preferential treat-
 ment for fee-paying patients, and substandard informa-
 tion provision [5–10]. In addition, communities with
 low levels of social trust and trust in healthcare service
 have been found to have below average active member-
 ship [8], suggesting that social capital may play role in
 NHIS enrolment in Ghana.
 Social capital is a multifaceted concept that has been
 used extensively in health research over the past two de-
 cades [11–14]. Social capital can be defined in different
 ways [15, 16], but is in the health literature mostly used
 as an indication of ‘social cohesion’ – whereby social
 capital is seen as a property of groups, with resources
 such as trust, norms and the exercise of sanctions, avail-
 able to individual members in that group; or of a ‘net-
 work’ – whereby resources, such as social support,
 information channels, social credentials, are embedded
 within an individual’s social network [17]. Szreter and
 Woolcock [18] distinguish between different types of so-
 cial capital, i.e. bonding, bridging and linking, reflecting
 different social links that exist in society. While Bonding
 social capital reflect ties between individuals with a rela-
 tively high degree of network closure, such as in families,
 close relatives, friends, neighbors, often associated with
 strong norms and trust, Bridging social capital concerns
 ties between individuals across social and economic di-
 vides, or between groups or associations, such as trade
 unions, professional groups, women groups. Bridging so-
 cial capital may not involve many shared norms but is
 often associated with reciprocity and ‘thin trust’ [16]. In
 contrast to bonding and bridging social capital, which
 are both seen as reflecting horizontal social ties within
 and across social groups, linking social capital (some-
 times referred to as vertical social capital) concerns
 norms of respect and networks of trusting relationships
 across explicit, formal, or institutionalized power or au-
 thority gradients in society [16, 18].
 Like in many African countries, social capital, in par-
 ticular bonding social capital, is believed to be an im-
 portant aspect of community life in Ghana [19, 20].
 Strong bonding ties exist in the extended families, where
 patriarchs lead important decisions [19]. Further,
 well-organized community groups, such as women
 groups, church communities, professional groups, and
 saving groups, exist in both urban and rural areas. These
 bonding community networks of trust and reciprocity
 play an important role in individual day-to-day
 decision-making, including health decisions [21, 22], and
 have been linked to a series of health outcomes [23–26,
 27, 28]. The question is whether social capital may also
 be linked to other health seeking behaviors, including
 enrolment in health insurance schemes.
 This paper reports on the study on enrollment in the
 NHIS in Ghana, and the role of social capital therein.
 The study consisted of a cluster randomized controlled
 trial to test two social-capital informed interventions to
 increase enrolment (see section “Methods” below). The
 interventions were innovative in that it aimed to pro-
 mote health insurance enrollment through increasing so-
 cial capital.
 The study has shown in a previous publication that
 there are high levels of social capital in Ghana, and iden-
 tified different types of social capital [8]. In particular, it
 found two types horizontal social capital, reflecting trust
 and solidarity, and collective action within the commu-
 nity; and two types of vertical social capita, reflecting
 trust in the healthcare provider and the NHIS respect-
 ively (Fig. 1).
 Community trust and solidarity, as well as trust in
 the healthcare provider and health insure were all
 associated with active enrollment in the NHIS. Based
 on these results, two social-capital informed interven-
 tions were developed with the intention to increase
 enrolment (see section “Design of interventions”). 
<section> In the current paper we report the results of the ran-
 domized controlled trial. In particular, we examined (1)
 the effectiveness of the interventions on active member-
 ship in the NHIS, (2) whether the interventions helped
 to increase levels of social capital, and (3) whether the
 effectiveness of the interventions was dependent on ini-
 tial levels of social capital. We expected that 1) the inter-
 ventions increase enrollment in the NHIS; 2) the
 interventions increase levels of social capital; and 3) the
 effectiveness of the intervention depends on initial levels
 of social capital. In addition, we expect that 4) the inter-
 ventions will be the most effective n communities with
 initial low levels of trust and solidarity and where com-
 munity members are less likely to encourage each other
 
<section> to enroll,
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> This clustered randomized controlled trial was conducted
 in 2011–2014 among NHIS insured and non-insured cli-
 ents of primary healthcare facilities in the predominantly
 urban region Greater Accra and the more rural Western
 Region in Ghana.
 
<section> Sampling
 
<section> The study used a multi-stage sampling strategy. The first
 stage of the multi-stage sampling strategy was the pur-
 posive selection of 16 NHIS district schemes (8 in each
 region) based on total population, NHIS enrolment
 coverage, NHIA accreditation status, and geographical
 location (urban – rural). In the second stage, 64 primary
 healthcare facilities (32 in each region) were selected on
 the basis of their ownership (public/private), location
 (rural/urban), and NHIS accreditation quality scores. A
 third stage of sampling was conducted to collect data
 from 1903 randomly selected households in both
 regions. Thirty households were sampled from within a
 radius of 10 km around each of the 64 selected primary
 healthcare facilities. In total data of 7097 individuals in
 the sampled households was collected in the baseline
 survey, which took place in April 2012.
 For the intervention, 32 health facilities (from the 64)
 were randomly selected to receive the interventions,
 while the remaining 32 facilities served as controls with-
 out an intervention [29–31]. A follow-up survey was
 conducted among 6971 individuals from the 64 facilities,
 which took place between March and June 2014 after
 the interventions were completed.
 
<section> Design of interventions
 The two interventions were designed through an itera-
 tive participatory process based on the results of the
 baseline survey. Stakeholders (the healthcare clients,
 healthcare providers, and the National Health Insurance
 Authority (NHIA)) gave their input to derive to the key
 components for the intervention [8]. The participatory
 approach, whereby stakeholders co-design the interven-
 tion, was chosen to facilitate interaction, mutual learn-
 ing, empowerment and trust-building between the
 different stakeholder groups. The rationale of co-design
 is that stakeholders know their context and interest best
 and can help define an appropriate, acceptable and feas-
 ible intervention which has a better chance to achieve
 result. Both interventions were also based on the con-
 cept of social capital.
 
<section> Intervention 1 (the light version), conducted in
 facilities, engaged existing community groups, identified
 with help of the district authorities, to monitor health-
 care and health insurance services and suggest improve-
 ments (See step by step process below and Fig. 2). This
 process was facilitated by a trained community health
 worker (CHW). The intervention included also two
 meetings between the community groups and the
 healthcare provider and district NHIS staff to discuss
 monitoring results and suggestions for improvement.
 We reason this process builds social capital (horizontal)
 by giving an important role to the group in improving
 health services in their community. Through informa-
 tion sharing and discussions between the group mem-
 bers, the CHW and the healthcare provider and NHIS
 staff, social capital (vertical) can be built.
 
<section> Intervention 2 (the intensive version), conducted in
 facilities, engaged individual clients, identified by the
 CHW during their visit to the clinic. The CHW subse-
 quently visited the individual client at his/her home
 within 6 days, assuring a short recall-period that would
 lead to more accurate responses than in intervention
 where group members of existing groups may not have
 used services for some time. Recall periods in health
 
<section> Fig. 2 The six steps of the intervention design 
<section> have been studied by other researchers [32, 33]. To
 minimize recall bias one should consider methodological
 approaches such as using well-structured standardized
 questions [32]. For intervention 2 we used structured
 questions and locally produced illustrative pictures. We
 adopted the conceptual model of the validated assess-
 ment test used in TB-care [34]. This TB Quote instru-
 ment uses a 6 days recall period. This period is also
 practical: it allows the community worker to follow the
 patient in the community more easily than when using a
 period of a month or longer. Secondly, it allows the pro-
 ject to proceed, analyse and validate the data and design
 an improvement plan with the stakeholders.
 The second interventions also included group meet-
 ings of the same clients that were first interviewed indi-
 vidually. In the group they discussed their monitoring
 findings and suggestions with healthcare and district
 NHIS staff. We reasoned that although this interven-
 tion may tap slightly less on the horizontal social
 capital (engaging individuals and not existing commu-
 nity groups), it does stimulate empowerment and
 strengthens vertical social capital through the inter-
 action with the health facility and NHIS staff.
 Both interventions thus entailed participatory monitor-
 ing of services and service improvement. In the monitor-
 ing, participants focused on ten service aspects
 (indicators) that derived from the baseline study in
 which we explored clients’ definition and perception on
 quality of services. Related to the healthcare provider
 these aspects were 1) Attitude of staff; 2) Punctuality of
 staff; 3) Information provision; 4) Availability of drugs;
 5) Queuing system; 6) Opportunity to provide feedback.
 
<section> For the NHIS these were: 7) Information provision; 8)
 Enrollment process; 9) Delivering services that are
 promised; 10) Opportunity to provide feedback. We
 applied a mixed methodology of scoring, using a scale
 from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent), and narrative responses.
 In addition, the Net Promotor Score (NPS) was used to
 measure the willingness of clients to promote the
 services (of health care provider or NHIS) to neighbors
 and friends, using a scale of 1 (very unlikely) to 4 (very
 likely).
 Intervention 2 comprised of six steps as presented in
 Fig. 2, while the intervention 1 comprised of five steps,
 making intervention 2 more intensive than intervention
 1. Both interventions were implemented and evaluated
 concurrently in the period May 2013 to February 2014.
 Results of these interventions are published by Alhassan
 et al. [29], Duku et al. [30] and Fenenga et al. [31] and.
 The following section briefly describes the engagement
 steps.
 
<section> Step 1 involved the recruitment of healthcare clients at
 the exit of a healthcare facility; Step 2 involved individual
 face-to-face interviews with clients in their own homes
 to obtain information about their experiences and views
 on healthcare facilities and health insurance. The results
 from the interviews were used as basis for a focus group
 discussion in Step 3. The focus group discussions were
 used to share information among group members about
 the assessment of the 10 mentioned aspects and NPS,
 but also to validate the findings of Step 2. Focus group
 discussions are usually more dynamic and generate new
 information through action-reaction responses. Step
 consisted of written and verbal reports to provide feed-
 back to healthcare providers and district insurance of-
 fices. A joint stakeholder meeting was convened in Step
 5. The meetings served as an open dialogue forum,
 involving different stakeholders to develop action plans
 to improve the services and make them more client
 focused. The final step (Step 6) was included to evaluate
 the implemented actions. Plaques of honor and small
 financial incentives were used to reward improved
 services of the healthcare provider and district NHIS
 office.
 
<section> Respondents and measures
 As discussed above, the number of respondents were
 7097 and 6971 in the baseline and follow-up surveys,
 respectively. In total, 3246 individuals were identified
 who filled out both surveys and were above the age of
 18. Additional file 1: Figure A.1 presents a flow diagram
 showing the inclusion of observations in the final sam-
 ple. As Additional file 1: Table A.1 suggests, respondents
 removed from the sample are largely similar to those
 included in the final sample. There are slight differences
 in terms of education profile and experience with paying
 for consultation and drugs. The only major difference is
 that the majority of removed individuals were from the
 Greater Accra region.
 While there were two types of interventions, they were
 combined for the analyses because they produced similar
 effects (the analyses with the two interventions separ-
 ately, with essentially similar results to the analysis with
 the combined group are presented in Additional file 1).
 Table 1 shows that the control and the combined inter-
 vention group of the final sample differ in a number of
 aspects. The Western region is somewhat underrepre-
 sented in the control group. The share of respondents
 evaluating their health status worse compared to other
 people similar to them is higher in the control group,
 while the probability of considering health status the
 same is higher in the intervention group. People in the
 control group were more likely to have paid for consult-
 ation in the past. These factors were included in the stat-
 istical models as controls.
 The main outcome variable of this study was enrol-
 ment in any health insurance scheme (survey question:
 “Are you currently enrolled in any health insurance

 scheme?”). A descriptive analysis on this variable is
 found in Section “The impacts of the intervention on
 social capital”.
 
<section> Social capital was measured by items consisting of
 statements. Respondents were asked to what extent they
 agreed or disagreed with the statements. They could re-
 spond using a five-point Likert scale from strongly dis-
 agree (with the value of 1) to strongly agree (with the
 value of 5). The items were developed using the theoret-
 ical framework as outlined in Fenenga et al. [8], covering
 the topics of trust, solidarity, community action, and
 trust in healthcare and NHIS services. A principal com-
 ponents analysis with Varimax rotation found that five
 social capital factors accounted for 66.8% of the original
 variance in the data (Additional file 1: Table B.1). The
 first factor comprised items related to trust in people in
 the community. This factor was labelled “horizontal so-
 cial capital – trust” (HC_trust), reflecting bonding social
 capital (see Fig. 1). The second factor, labelled “vertical
 social capital – provider 1” (VC_prov1) contained items
 related to attitudes to personnel and fairness of the
 queuing system in the facility. The third factor was la-
 belled “Horizontal social capital – action” (HC_action),
 and can be considered to reflect aspects of both bonding
 and bridging capital (see Fig. 1). The fourth factor, la-
 belled “Vertical social capital – provider 2” (VC_prov2)
 reflects views on the quality of the facilities. The last fac-
 tor “Vertical social capital – NHIS” (VC_nhis) captures
 the trustworthiness and adequacy of the National Health
 Insurance Scheme. The items and factor loading are pre-
 sented in Additional file 1: Table B.2.
 The socio-demographic sections of the questionnaire in-
 cluded questions on age, sex, region, religion, household
 wealth, and highest level of completed education.
 Household wealth is measured as the annual per capita
 food and non-food consumption expenditure. The
 questionnaire further included question on health status
 (“Is your health better or worse than that of other people
 of the same sex and age you know in your community?”),
 and experiences with healthcare provider at the last visit

<section> Model specifications
 We used multilevel modelling to analyse the data con-
 sisting of individuals clustered within facilities. First, we
 constructed a set of two multilevel logit models to
 examine the effectiveness of the intervention in terms of
 enrolment in the NHIS insurance scheme. The first
 model included a dummy indicating the measurement
 occasion (follow-up versus baseline) and a dummy indi-
 cating the intervention group. The relative changes in
 the intervention group as compared to the control group
 were indicated by the interaction term of the two. The
 second model further included the five social capital fac-
 tors as described above.
 Second, we constructed a series of five multilevel
 regression models in which we used the social capital
 factors as the dependent variables. Just as for the first
 set of analyses, we included dummies indicating the
 measurement occasion, the intervention group, and the
 interaction between measurement occasion and the
 intervention group. Controls were also included.
 Third, we constructed a series of five multilevel
 models to determine whether the effectiveness of the
 interventions was dependent on initial levels of social
 capital. The dependent variable was enrolment in insur-
 ance at follow-up. The models contain insurance enrol-
 ment at baseline, a dummy for the intervention group
 and the socio-demographic controls. The variables of
 interest were the interactions between the intervention
 group and social capital aspects. Instead of presenting
 full tables, we report only the marginal effects of the
 intervention group (compared to control) at different
 initial social capital levels.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> The effectiveness of the intervention
 Figure 3 shows the differences of insurance coverage in
 the control and the combined intervention group at
 baseline and follow-up. The share of respondent with
 insurance coverage grew from 36.49 to 36.75% in the
 control group and from 40.29 to 49.39% in the (com-
 bined) intervention group. According to the independent
 t-test, the 4 percentage point higher insurance coverage
 of the intervention group at baseline is significant at the
 5% level (ΔM = − 3.80, p = 0.029). The difference be-
 tween the control and intervention group increased to
 about 12 percentage point by the time of the follow-up
 survey and the difference is significant at the 1% level
 
<section> (ΔM = − 11.74, p = 0.000). Changes over time were
 assessed with paired t-tests. While the small increase in
 the control group is statistically not significant (ΔM =
 
<section> 1.16, p = 0.424), the about 9 percentage point change in
 the treatment group is significant at the 1% level (ΔM =
 
<section> 9.10, p-value = 0.000). Figure 3 suggests that the inter-
 vention promoted insurance enrollment.
 The conclusion of Fig. 3 is confirmed by the first set
 of multilevel regressions in Table 2, with a significant in-
 teractions between the intervention and follow-up
 (Model 1). The interaction term remained significant
 when controlling for the different social capital variables
 (Model 2 in Table 2). The significant coefficients of

 models, suggesting that the intervention had no differen-
 tial effect on any of the social capital factors. In sum-
 mary, the similar social capital change patterns across
 the control and intervention group are confirmed by the
 multivariate regression models. The full table with the
 coefficients of socio-demographic controls is presented
 in Additional file 1: Table C.2.
 
<section> Initial levels of social capital and the effectiveness of the
 
<section> intervention
 We subsequently conducted a series of analyses introdu-
 cing interaction terms between the initial levels of social
 capital types and the intervention group types to explore
 whether the effectiveness of the interventions is
 dependent on social capital. Each model controls for be-
 ing insured at baseline, the intervention group and a set
 of socio-demographic controls. Moreover, each model
 contains the baseline level of one of the social capital as-
 pects and their interaction with the intervention group.
 All remaining variables are kept at their mean. The full
 regression table is reported in Additional file 1: Table
 C.3; here (Fig. 5) we present only the marginal effects
 estimated from Additional file 1: Table C.3. The lines in
 Fig. 5 can be interpreted as follows. Each circle of the
 line indicates how much higher or lower the probability
 of a respondent being insured in the intervention group
 compared to a similar other in the control group at vari-
 ous initial social capital levels.
 The general pattern suggests that the effectiveness of
 the intervention is greater at lower levels of “horizontal
 social capital – trust”, “horizontal social capital – action”
 and “vertical social capital – provider 2”. It also shows
 that beyond a certain level, the effects are independent
 of a person receiving the intervention or not. An indi-
 vidual with high levels of social capital in the interven-
 tion group then would have the same chance of
 enrolling in insurance as in the control group. “Vertical
 social capital – provider 1” seems to influence the effect-
 iveness of the intervention the opposite way. If we
 moved two people from control to the intervention
 group, the likelihood of enrolling into insurance of the
 one with higher “Vertical social capital – provider 1”
 would be increased to a greater extent.
 
<section> Discussion
 The sustainability of health insurance schemes that cur-
 rently arise in many low and middle-income countries
 to improve access to quality health care and lower the
 out-of-pocket expenses is challenged by a range of
 factors. These have been well described in the literature
 [35–39]. One important factor is realizing adequate en-
 rolment and retention of clients. In order to explore so-
 lutions that will support Ghana’s NHIS to increase its
 sustainability, this study explored whether and how cli-
 ent engagement would be an effective strategy.
 While various studies have demonstrated the potential
 value of social capital in influencing health seeking
 behaviour [23, 25], this study builds upon this know-
 ledge by testing whether client engagement in monitor-
 ing and improving healthcare and health insurance
 services positively influence clients’ trust in the NHIS
 and their willingness to enrol in the program. Reasoning
 that stakeholder participation in the design and imple-
 mentation of the interventions will strengthen commu-
 nication, information sharing, mutual understanding and
 relationship building, we hypothesized that social capital
 (horizontal and vertical) and subsequently insurance
 enrolment would increase as a result of the intervention.
 This paper presents the results of a cluster randomised
 controlled trial in which two interventions were tested
 to increase active membership of the Ghana NHIS. The
 study examined whether (1) the interventions were ef-
 fective at raising active membership in the NHIS, (2) the
 interventions helped to increase levels of social capital,
 and (3) the effectiveness of the interventions was
 dependent on initial levels of social capital. As the
 effects of the two interventions were comparable, they
 were combined in the analyses. Other papers published
 on these interventions focus on the effect on patient
 safety and risk reduction efforts in primary health facil-
 ities [29] and on healthcare utilization, frequency of ill-
 ness and perceptions on quality of healthcare [30]. Our
 first main finding is that the combined intervention was
 effective in increasing NHIS enrolment. The second
 main finding is the positive relationship between the ver-
 tical types of social capital and insurance enrolment. It
 reinforces previous findings in the literature [40, 41] that
 trustworthiness of providers and insurance schemes and
 positive attitudes of medical staff play an important role
 in people’s decision on joining insurance schemes. The
 third main finding is that the interventions are more
 effective where there is a low level of social capital. In
 practice, it means that in a low social capital environ-
 ment even light engagement interventions might be a
 cost-effective tool in increasing insurance enrolment.
 While we have shown that the interventions effectively
 increased enrolment, and that social capital has a posi-
 tive effect on enrolment, findings are inconclusive about
 the effect of the interventions on the different types of
 social capital. In other words, we can show that the
 combined intervention had a positive effect on enrol-
 ment but not that it affects social capital. Future re-
 search should aim to identify other community factors 
<section> that are part of the enrolment process, whether other in-
 terventions to improve the quality of services could help
 to increase enrolment and, as a result, could provide
 community benefits in terms of social capital. Our base-
 line and follow-up survey include a range of social cap-
 ital items, which could potentially be linked to the
 concept of social capital. Another direction is to identify
 and test potential channels other than social capital
 through which the intervention could impact enrolment.
 One explanation of the effectiveness of the intervention
 can be the increased attention on health insurance, en-
 couraging healthcare and health insurance providers to
 improve their services. Alhassan et al. concluded from
 this same study that healthcare staff efforts towards in-
 creasing patient safety and reducing risk improved sig-
 nificantly in intervention facilities especially in the areas
 
<section> of leadership/accountability [29].
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> In conclusion we can say that the intervention increases
 enrolment in the health insurance program. Although
 we did not find a change in social capital, we reason that
 the intervention effect of improved services in time will
 also influence clients’ trust in the service providers and
 thus increase the level of vertical social capital. It would
 be reasonable that such change require longer continu-
 
<section> ation of the intervention.
 
<section> Finally, findings can guide the NHIS in Ghana and
 other countries to realize more client engagement in the
 planning and implementation of their programs in order
 
<section> to enhance enrolment.
