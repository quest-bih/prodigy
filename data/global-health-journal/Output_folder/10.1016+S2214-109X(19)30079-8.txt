<section> Summary
 
<section> Background—Paediatric vaccination against influenza can result in indirect protection, by
 reducing transmission to their unvaccinated contacts. We investigated whether influenza
 vaccination of children would protect them and their household members in a resource-limited

<section> setting.
 
<section> Methods—We did a cluster-randomised, blinded, controlled study in three villages in India.
 
<section> Manuscript Clusters were defined as households (ie, dwellings that shared a courtyard), and children aged
 months to 10 years were eligible for vaccination as and when they became age-eligible throughout
 the study. Households were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-based system to intramuscular
 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) or a control of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in
 the beginning of the study; vaccination occurred once a year for 3 years. The primary efficacy
 outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza in a vaccinated child with febrile acute respiratory
 illness, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (ie, children who received at least

<section> Methods
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> This study was a prospective, household-randomised, controlled trial, done in three villages
 
<section> Manuscript in northern India (Dayalpur, Atali, and Chandawali). Clusters were defined as individual
 households—ie, dwellings (compounds) that shared a courtyard—situated within these
 villages. A cluster design was intentionally selected to measure household-level effects of
 vaccine. The protocol has been published. 
<section> 10 The All India Institute of Medical Sciences
 (AIIMS) Ethics Committee and University of Alabama Birmingham Institutional Review
 Board reviewed and approved the study. An independent data safety and monitoring board
 (DSMB) assessed safety during annual meetings.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> All residents of three study villages in northern India were eligible to participate in
 
<section> Author
 
<section> surveillance for FARI. For the vaccination component of the study, only children aged
 between 6 months and 10 years were eligible. Exclusion criteria from the vaccine
 
<section> Manuscript component of the study were known allergy to eggs, vaccine or vaccine component hyper
 sensitivity, acute severe febrile illness (temporary exclusion), or any other condition that
 would impose a health risk. Written or oral informed consent was obtained for both
 surveillance and vaccine study participants; parental consent was obtained for children, and
 depending on their age, the child’s assent was also requested. Families without vaccine-
 eligible children participated in the virological surveillance component of the study.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 Households were randomly assigned to either the trivalent influenza vaccine (IIV3;
 
<section> Author intervention) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV; control) group (1:1), via a computer-
 based randomisation program in STATA. Randomisation was done for all households in the
 villages irrespective of presence of children and before enrolment. This approach allowed
 
<section> Manuscript families who might have had children after enrolment to be eligible for vaccination and
 inclusion. The allocation to IIV3 or IPV remained fixed throughout the entire study period.
 No stratification or restriction criteria were used. To reduce risk of unblinding, an AIIMS
 statistician developed multiple vaccine codes for each vaccine allocation. One vaccine code
 was assigned to each randomised vaccine-eligible child for each vaccination round. The 
<section> vaccine codes represented either IPV or IIV3 and, therefore, were based on the household
 
<section> Author randomisation. Each child received vaccine and individual codes so that they could be
 correctly identified during immunisation. Lists containing vaccine codes and child identifiers
 were provided to a dedicated team responsible for the vaccination. The study statistician had
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> no direct contact with either vaccination or surveillance teams and provided data to the
 DSMB in sealed envelopes for their review of adverse events. People delivering vaccination
 were hired solely for the vaccination campaign and were separate from the field assessment
 teams. Labels were applied by a pharmacist not involved in other aspects of the study that
 showed the vaccine code and obscured the underlying labels of the pre-filled vaccine
 syringes. All investigators, observers, laboratory staff, and participants were masked to the
 vaccine assignment.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> Author At the time of study initiation, influenza virus circulation in India was poorly understood.
 Furthermore, only influenza vaccines with a northern hemisphere formulation were available
 in India; therefore, we used northern hemisphere vaccine formulations for the study.
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> Enrolled children were vaccinated in the following periods: year 1 (Nov 24, 2009, to Jan 17,
 2010), year 2 (Oct 13, 2010, to Dec 13, 2010), and year 3 (Oct 7, 2011, to Dec 18, 2011).
 Children were re-vaccinated in years 2 and 3 if they remained in the eligible study age
 range. Intramuscular, northern hemisphere seasonal inactivated split-virion IIV3 (Vaxigrip
 Junior [0·25 mL dose, 7·5 μg of each haemagglutinin antigen for children aged 6–35
 months] or Vaxigrip [0·5 mL dose, 15 μg of each haemagglutinin antigen for children aged
 3–10 years]), and IPV (Imovax Polio, 0·5 mL dose for all children) were purchased from
 Sanofi Pasteur (India). 
<section> 10 Two doses of the study vaccines were planned for year 1 (2009–10)
 and one dose in subsequent years for patients aged between 6 months and 8 years, and only
 
<section> Author one dose yearly for those aged 9–10 years. However, in response to the 2009 emergence of
 influenza A/California/7/2009 (H1N1pdm09) virus, two doses of vaccine (for both IIV3 and
 IPV groups) were administered to children between 6 months and 8 years of age in year
 
<section> Manuscript (2010), even if vaccinated in year 11 In year 1 (2009–10), vaccine comprised influenza A/
 Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria
 lineage) strains, and in years 2 and 3, influenza A/California/7/2009 (H1N1pdm09), A/
 Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage).
 
<section> Adverse events (both expected and unexpected), including serious events, were monitored
 and recorded. At time of vaccination, children were observed for immediate adverse events
 for 30 min and received follow-up visits by study staff at days 1, 7, and 30 after vaccination.
 Any reports of a child’s admission to hospital or death during the entire study period were
 
<section> Author evaluated and assessed for a relationship with vaccination.
 
<section> Year-round active surveillance for FARI was done via weekly household visits from
 
<section> Manuscript November, 2009, until April, 2012. 
<section> 11 Year 3 included only a partial year of surveillance
 (ended on May 1, 2012), because of the initiation of a second phase of this study with pre-
 monsoon (June) vaccination beginning in 2012. 
<section> 11 FARI was defined as reported fever and
 any respiratory complaint (cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, earache, or
 difficulty breathing) with onset in the previous week; measurement of temperature was not 
<section> required. An episode of FARI was considered a new event if 2 weeks had passed from the
 
<section> Author onset of a previous episode. Throat and nasal swabs were collected (nasal swabs alone in
 infants), from all participants with FARI, placed in transport medium, and maintained at 4°C
 for up to 24 h until transported to the laboratory.
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> Specimens were tested by real-time RT-PCR for influenza A and B viruses, 
<section> 12 and, if
 positive, the subtype was determined with the same method. A subset of influenza B viruses
 were classified into Victoria and Yamagata lineages by real-time RT-PCR as previously
 described. 
<section> 12 A third of the real-time RT-PCR-positive specimens were inoculated into
 Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells for virus isolation; isolates were subtyped by use of
 WHO kits for haemagglutination inhibition and guinea pig red blood cells.

 not included in the protocol, but decided before starting the study) immunogenicity study

<section> (appendix). The first 531 age-eligible children in the three villages whose parents consented
 to blood draw were selected to participate in this substudy and 1–2 mL of venous blood was
 
<section> Manuscript collected before vaccination. Approximately half of the children provided a second blood
 sample 4 weeks after the first dose, and the other half 4 weeks after the second dose of the
 vaccine. Serum samples were tested for influenza antibodies by use of a haemagglutination
 inhibition assay with turkey red blood cells and vaccine-matched antigens following WHO
 protocols. 
<section> 13 For influenza B virus, ether-treated antigen was used. Seroprotection was
 defined as a titre of 1:40 or more, seroconversion as a prevaccination titre of less than 1:10,
 and a post-vaccination titre of 1:40 or more; or a prevaccination titre of 1:10 or more and at
 least a 4-fold rise in post-vaccination antibody titre.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> Author
 
<section> The primary outcome for total efficacy was laboratory-confirmed influenza in a vaccinated
 child with FARI. Total efficacy reflects both the direct protection provided by vaccination
 
<section> Manuscript and an indirect effect from vaccination of other children in the household and community.
 The secondary outcome for indirect effectiveness (surveillance study) was FARI with
 laboratory-confirmed influenza in an unvaccinated household member of a vaccine study
 participant.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> Three sets of data were linked through unique identifiers: electronic database with
 demographic information for residents, field data forms scanned into a database (TeleForm
 software, Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and laboratory data.

<section> Manuscript
 
<section> vaccine efficacy and indirect vaccine effectiveness. 
<section> 15 A child was analysed as part of the
 IIV3 or IPV group according to the vaccine that the child first received in the study,
 irrespective of which vaccine they received later (eg, even in the cases of receiving the
 wrong vaccine through inadvertent protocol deviation or missed doses). Eligible children
 who did not receive any vaccine, those who were never in surveillance, and those who had

<section> Author Sample size estimations (assuming influenza attack rate of 5% per year in the control group,

<section> 10 were 785 households or 1570 individuals per group
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> to assess total protection and 893 households or 4465 individuals for indirect protection.
 These estimates were based on a conservative assumption of an intracluster coefficient of
 variation of 0.25; with about two vaccine-eligible children per household, only a small
 proportion of households were expected to have more than one confirmed child case, with
 resulting low within-household correlation. Vaccine efficacy was estimated for each year
 separately using a Cox proportional hazards model accounting for random-effect clustering
 by household (frailty model). 
<section> 17,18 The initial statistical analysis plan included a pooled
 multi-year estimate, as well as use of a Poisson model for vaccine efficacy estimation, but
 was changed per input from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
 
<section> Author statistician (PG; appendix). Both statistical analysis plan and results of the Poisson model
 are provided in the appendix.
 
<section> Manuscript Children were included in the analysis 15 days after receiving their last dose of vaccine that
 year, until the first of the following censoring events: infection with influenza virus
 (censored by any influenza infection for analysis of protection against any influenza
 infection, or by the specific virus type or subtype for analysis of virus type-specific and
 subtype-specific protection), last follow-up visit of that year, death, reaching 11 years of age,
 receiving a vaccination for the subsequent study year, or end of observation period. Vaccine
 efficacy estimates were stratified by predetermined subgroups: age group, sex, and time
 from vaccination (first and second halves of each annual surveillance period). Age was
 stratified into three groups: 6–35 months (two doses of 0·25 mL of IIV3), 36 months to
 years (two doses of 0·5 mL of IIV3), and 9–10 years (one dose of 0·5 mL of IIV3). Indirect
 
<section> Author
 
<section> effectiveness was analysed similarly; unvaccinated individuals were included in the analysis
 if they belonged to a household in which at least one child received one or more doses of
 
<section> Manuscript vaccine for a given study year. The analysis period for all unvaccinated individuals began
 days after the last dose of vaccine was received among all vaccinated children in the
 household that year. No correction for multiple comparisons was made. The analysis code
 was written (in SAS Enterprise) and applied blindly first to all the data with no information
 on vaccine allocation to generate tables and examine balance between subgroups and
 categories. Then the code was applied to the unblinded data with no further modification to
 the code for exploratory analyses.

<section> Results
 
<section> Author
 
<section> From Sept 3, 2009, to May 1, 2012, a total of 3208 households were enrolled in the
 surveillance study, of which 1959 households had vaccine-eligible children. In year 1, 1680
 
<section> Manuscript households in the three villages had vaccine-eligible children, with 835 households allocated
 to IIV3 and 845 households allocated to IPV. Similarly, 1713 (859 IIV3 and 854 IPV)
 households had vaccine-eligible children in year 2 and 1686 (864 IIV3 and 822 IPV) in year
 3 of the study. The number of children eligible for vaccination was similar in all years
 (figures 1, 2). At time of enrolment, children and household members in the IIV3 and IPV
 groups were similar in age, sex, household make-up, number of vaccinated children in the
 household, and school participation (table 1). Year-to-year comparison of vaccinated
 children and other household members in the IIV3 and IPV groups are provided in the
 appendix.
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus emerged during year 1, and was not a component of the
 2009–10 vaccine administered that year (figure 3). Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus did not
 
<section> Manuscript occur substantially in years 2 or 3 (figure 3). Influenza A(H3N2) virus was observed
 primarily in year 2 and influenza B virus was detected throughout the 3 study years (figure
 3). Of 493 identified influenza B virus strains among vaccine recipients, 337 (68%) were
 further characterised and, of these, 287 (85%) were B/Victoria-like (antigenically similar to
 vaccine strain), and the remainder were of Yamagata lineage. Distribution of influenza virus
 types was similar among those in the indirect protection group (data not shown).
 
<section> In year 1, influenza virus was detected in 151 (10%) of 1572 IIV3 recipients and 206 (13%)
 of 1633 of IPV recipients, with a total vaccine efficacy of 25·6% (95% CI 6·8–40·6,
 p=0·010; table 2) against FARI due to any influenza virus. In year 2, influenza virus was
 
<section> Author detected in 105 (6%) of 1705 IIV3 recipients and 182 (10%) of 1814 IPV recipients; total
 vaccine efficacy was 41·0% (24·1–54·1; p<0·0001). In year 3, influenza virus was detected
 in 20 (1%) of 1670 IIV3 recipients and 81 (5%) of 1786 IPV recipients; total vaccine
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> efficacy was 74·2% (57·8–84·3; p<0·0001). Poisson analysis provided similar results
 (appendix). In year 1, total vaccine efficacy against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was not
 statistically significant. In year 2, however, total vaccine efficacy against antigentically
 matched influenza A(H3N2) virus was statistically significant. Total vaccine efficacy against
 influenza B virus varied by year, despite an antigenic match of the predominant B/Victoria
 lineage with the vaccine in all 3 years.
 
<section> Total vaccine efficacy was similar between boys and girls. Among age groups, total vaccine
 efficacy was statistically significant for patients aged between 36 months and 8 years for the
 
<section> Author 3 years of the study; vaccine efficacy was also significant for children aged 6–35 months
 during years 2 and 3, and for those aged 9–10 years for year 3 (table 2). In year 1, total
 vaccine efficacy for all vaccinees was not statistically significant for the period up to
 
<section> Manuscript months after vaccination (table 2) when influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was circulating,
 whereas for the period 6–11 months after vaccination, during which influenza B was
 circulating, total vaccine efficacy was statistically significant (table 2). Total vaccine efficacy
 stratified by time after vaccination could not be estimated in year 2 because too few 
<section> infections occurred in year 3 since the observation period was truncated in April, 2012 (table
 
<section> Author 2).
 
<section> Overall, indirect vaccine effectiveness was statistically significant only in year 3, with
 
<section> Manuscript influenza virus detected in 39 (1%) of 4323 household members in the IIV3 group and 60
 (1%) of 4121 household members in the IPV group. This indirect effect in year 3 was also
 significant for influenza B virus. The indirect vaccine effectiveness in year 2 for influenza B
 virus was similar to the efficacy in year 3, although the the 95% CIs narrowly crossed zero
 (36·2% [95% CI –0·2 to 59·4]; table 3). In years 1 and 2, no statistically significant indirect
 vaccine effectiveness was observed in any age group. In year 3, among household members
 aged 18–49 years, influenza virus was detected in 17 (1%) of 2736 in the IIV3 group and 31
 (1%) of 2627 in the IPV group for an indirect vaccine effectiveness of 47·3% (95% CI 4·8–
 70·8; table 3). Indirect vaccine effectiveness was not observed when analysed by sex in any
 
<section> Author study year (table 3).
 
<section> Safety was analysed among all participants who received with at least one dose of the
 
<section> Manuscript vaccine. Local and systemic reactions were uncommon and similar between the IIV3 and
 IPV groups (table 4). In the IIV3 group, 225 (14%) of 1632 children in year 1, 375 (22%) of
 1718 in year 2, and 209 (12%) of 1673 in year 3 had an adverse reaction (compared with
 216 [12%] of 1730, 380 [21%] of 1825, and 235 [13%] of 1796, respectively, in the IPV
 group). The most common reactions in both groups were fever and tenderness at site. No
 serious adverse events were reported. Over the study, eight deaths occurred in the IIV3
 cohort and seven in the IPV group; vaccine efficacy against any influenza virus infection did
 not change when these deaths were excluded from the analysis (data not shown).
 
<section> In year 1, few children in the IIV3 and IPV groups had seroprotective antibody titres against
 
<section> Author seasonal influenza A(H1N1; appendix) and influenza B viruses before vaccination, but more
 than half had seroprotective titres against influenza A(H3N2) virus before vaccination
 (appendix). After two doses of vaccine in year 1, 82·9% (95% CI 66·3–93·4) of children in
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> the IIV3 group showed seroprotective titres against the three influenza vaccine viruses. In
 year 2, 93·3% (85·9–97·5) of the children in the IIV3 group had titres of 1:40 or more after
 two doses of vaccine.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> This randomised controlled study among children in rural India showed a significant total
 (direct and indirect) vaccine efficacy of IIV3 against influenza-associated FARI, although
 with year-to-year variability. We also found significant indirect protection in year 3, the year
 when the vaccine-matched influenza B (Victoria lineage) predominated and when the
 
<section> Author
 
<section> vaccine efficacy among vaccinees was highest. Immunogenicity of influenza vaccination
 was also shown in this population. Despite these significant findings, total vaccine efficacy
 
<section> Manuscript varied substantially between years, even when vaccine was well matched (eg, vaccine
 efficacy against influenza B in year 2). One possible factor was the timing of vaccination in
 concordance with temperate northern hemisphere influenza seasonality, which is now known
 to be suboptimal for most regions in India. 
<section> 11 This variability in total and indirect protection 
<section> from year to year emphasises the importance of multiple year studies in assessing the true
 
<section> Author effect of influenza vaccines and informing public health policy in India.
 
<section> The effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines in children has been shown to vary by
 
<section> Manuscript year and study, hence direct comparisons of vaccine efficacy are challenging, particularly
 between countries with different seasonality. This variability is driven by many factors,
 including vaccination timing, how well matched the vaccine is to circulating viruses, and the
 age and underlying health status of the study population. 
<section> 19 A review 7 published in 2011
 reported only one randomised controlled trial of IIV3 in children as young as 6 months that
 used specific and sensitive tests for influenza virus. In this US study, IIV3 efficacy against
 acute otitis media was 66% in the first year; in the second year attack rates were very low
 and efficacy was difficult to evaluate. 
<section> 20 A more recent randomised controlled trial was done
 with children aged between 6 months and 72 months, in which one group received IIV3
 
<section> Author alone. Efficacy against all strains was 43% and against vaccine-matched strains was 45%;
 our results (range 25·66–74·2%) are similar. 
<section> 21 Similarly, a randomised controlled trial 
<section> 22 of
 children aged 3–8 years in several low-resourced countries showed a vaccine efficacy of
 
<section> Manuscript 59% from a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4) containing both influenza B virus lineages
 compared with a control vaccine. A study 
<section> 23 of trivalent cold-adapted influenza vaccine
 against culture-confirmed influenza in children showed efficacy during two consecutive
 influenza seasons at multiple sites in Asia (70% in year 1 and 64% in year 2, against any
 influenza strains). Two studies 
<section> 24,25 of Russian-backbone live attenuated influenza vaccine,
 from Senegal and Bangladesh, reported that vaccine efficacy for vaccine-matched strains
 was 58% in Bangladesh, whereas no efficacy was shown in Senegal.
 
<section> Vaccination of school children during an influenza outbreak has been shown to reduce
 illness in families compared with communities in which schoolchildren were not vaccinated.
 
<section> Author 5,26 In Japan, an ecological study suggested that all-age mortality due to pneumonia and
 influenza was reduced when mandatory influenza vaccination of school children was
 introduced and increased after vaccination was made optional. 
<section> 27 Community-level
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> protection (indirect effectiveness 61%) was shown in a cluster-randomised trial 6 of IIV3
 among children aged 36 months to 15 years in Hutterite communities in Canada, when using
 real-time RT-PCR for influenza virus detection. In our study, total protection in year 3,
 measured for only half a year, was roughly double that seen for indirect vaccine
 effectiveness (total 74·2% vs indirect 38·1%). This result might suggest a threshold level of
 protection was needed to show indirect effects, but in year 2, total vaccine efficacy for
 influenza A(H3N2) virus was 64·5% and no indirect vaccine effectiveness was observed.
 However, variability in factors affecting indirect vaccine effectiveness, such as social mixing
 patterns, makes comparison of these estimates across studies challenging. Randomisation at
 
<section> Author the community level would lead to an estimate of the maximal indirect vaccine effectiveness
 because the immediately surrounding population would be vaccinated (or unvaccinated). We
 deliberately randomised by household because we believed that, in a vaccination
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> programme, vaccinated individuals would tend to cluster in households because of a care-
 giver decision to vaccinate; however, this approach probably leads to a lower indirect
 vaccine effectiveness estimate than if a whole community was vaccinated because of
 opportunities for exposure to influenza-infected individuals from nearby households in
 which children were not vaccinated against influenza. 
<section> A subset of children were tested for antibodies to influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2),
 
<section> Author and influenza B. Among the IIV3 recipients, a large majority seroconverted and developed
 seroprotective antibody titres with rises in geometric mean titres. Seroprotection was defined
 as haemagglutination titres of 1:40 or more, which, in adults, corresponds to a 50%
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> reduction the risk of influenza virus infection. This standard definition might be too low to
 be an accurate correlate of protection for children. 
<section> 14,19,28 Our subset of children tested for
 immunogenicity was too small to analyse correlates of protection.
 
<section> Our study has several limitations. In year 1, vaccination took place during the winter, when
 influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus was already emerging as the predominant strain, and was
 not included in the study vaccine. Neither protection nor increased risk of influenza
 A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was seen among vaccinees. Because influenza seasonality in India
 was not well understood at the time, vaccination occurred 8–9 months before peak influenza
 
<section> Author circulation through out the study, which probably affected vaccine efficacy. In year 3, we
 were not able to analyse the possibility of declining protection over time from vaccination
 because the follow-up period stopped by May 1, 2012, with the start of a study of pre-
 
<section> Manuscript monsoon influenza vaccination. The lower number of events in year 3 than years 1 and 2,
 therefore, might have led to a lack of power to detect efficacy. Timing of influenza virus
 circulation might also be a factor in the poor total efficacy against an antigenically matched
 influenza B virus in year 2, which is otherwise difficult to explain. However, the indirect
 effects appeared quite high (although were not statistically significant) against influenza B
 virus that year. Since influenza B virus circulation occurred primarily at the end of the study
 year, children might have had waning of immunity. 
<section> 29 However, reduced protection for
 longer than 5 months after vaccination was not observed in year 1 for influenza B or in year
 2 for influenza A(H3N2) viruses.
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Vaccines are the primary tools in the prevention of influenza virus infection in young
 children. In a rural setting in India, we showed immunogenicity of IIV3, and moderate total
 and indirect vaccine effectiveness, which varied by study year, virus type, and virus subtype.
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> Prevention of influenza virus infection in India and similar tropical climates requires
 innovative approaches and recognition that optimal timing of vaccination differs from
 temperate parts of the world, and might also differ within the country by locality because of
 differences in climate and virus seasonality within a country. 
<section> 19 These data together with
 cost-effectiveness and burden estimates of influenza can inform policy in India, especially
 regarding the existing WHO recommendations for influenza vaccination of young children.
 However, further studies are required to better understand variability in vaccine efficacy in
 tropical settings and to inform global and national policy for influenza vaccination,
 particularly in children.

<section> Author
 
<section> Evidence before this study
 
<section> Manuscript We searched PubMed, on Jan 7, 2007, for studies done in developing countries on
 influenza vaccine efficacy in children and indirect protection after influenza vaccination
 of children. We used the search terms “influenza vaccine”, “child”, and “developing
 country”, for studies since database inception, for articles published in English.
 
<section> We found no such studies. Subsequently a study of cold-adapted influenza vaccine,
 trivalent against culture-confirmed influenza in children showed efficacy during two
 consecutive influenza seasons at multiple sites in Asia.
 
<section> A randomised controlled trial of children aged 3–8 years in several low-resource
 countries administered a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4) containing both influenza
 
<section> Author B lineages. Efficacy for the IIV4 vaccinated cohort was 39%. Two studies of Russian-
 backbone live-attenuated influenza vaccine, from Senegal and Bangladesh, reported that
 vaccine efficacy for vaccine-matched strains was 58% in Bangladesh, whereas no
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> efficacy was shown in Senegal.
 
<section> Thus, information about influenza vaccine efficacy in developing countries is scarce.
 Similarly, although vaccination of children against influenza is thought to reduce
 influenza transmission to other susceptible individuals, resulting in indirect protection,
 studies to estimate indirect effects are very scarce. In one randomised controlled trial
 done among Hutterite communities in Canada, among non-vaccinated individuals,
 vaccine effectiveness was 61% against real-time RT-PCR-confirmed influenza infections.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 
<section> Author
 
<section> We did a randomised controlled study in rural India over 3 years to measure total (direct
 and indirect) vaccine efficacy of IIV3 among children and indirect protection of
 
<section> Manuscript household members of all ages. This trial is the first randomised control trial designed to
 investigate indirect effects at household-level in any setting. Influenza virus was detected
 by sensitive and specific molecular assays. Total protection varied by year and by type of
 influenza that was circulating. Indirect protection was shown in only 1 of the 3 years.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 
<section> In a resource-limited country, IIV3 can prevent influenza virus infections among children
 and reduce infections among others in the households of the vaccinated children.
 Significant household-level indirect protection was observed during 1 year of high direct
 protection and should be considered as a potential effect of vaccination.
