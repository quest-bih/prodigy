<section> Abstract
 
<section> Objective—The risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) among women undergoing elective
 gynecologic surgery where a catheter is placed is high: 10 to 64% following catheter removal. We
 conducted the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the therapeutic efficacy
 of cranberry juice capsules in preventing UTI post surgery.
 
<section> Study Design—We recruited patients from a single hospital between August 2011 and January
 
<section> Author 2013. Eligible participants were undergoing elective gynecologic surgery that did not involve a
 fistula repair or vaginal mesh removal. 160 patients were randomized and received two cranberry
 juice capsules two times a day, equivalent to two 8-ounce servings of cranberry juice, for 6 weeks
 
<section> Manuscript after surgery, or matching placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who
 experienced clinically-diagnosed and treated UTI with or without positive urine culture. Kaplan-
 Meier plots and logrank tests compared the two treatment groups.
 
<section> Results—The occurrence of UTI was significantly lower in the cranberry treatment group
 compared to the placebo group (15/80 (19%) versus 30/80 (38%); OR=0.38; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.79;
 p=0.008). After adjustment for known confounders, including frequency of intermittent self-
 catheterization in the post- operative period, the protective effects of cranberry remained
 (OR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.94). There were no treatment differences in the incidence of adverse
 events; including gastrointestinal upset (56% vs. 61% for cranberry vs. placebo).

<section> INTRODUCTION
 
<section> Urinary tract infections (UTI) remain one of the most common hospital-acquired infections
 (1). The vast majority of hospital-associated UTI are attributed to use of a urinary catheter
 (2). Even following removal of the catheter, risk of UTI remains high, with postoperative
 patients being particularly vulnerable. Among women undergoing elective urogenital
 
<section> Author surgery the 6-week cumulative incidence of a symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI)
 following catheter removal is 10 to 64% (reviewed in (3)), compared to 3–4% per year for
 women in the general population (4). Within hours following insertion, bacteria colonize the
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> urinary catheter surface; the incidence of significant bacteriuria is 5% per day of
 catheterization regardless of gender (5). A meta-analysis of 7 studies of short-term
 catheterized patients (including men and women and surgeries of various types) found that
 antibiotics given at time of catheter removal reduced UTI incidence by ~50%, but the risk
 remained significant: 4.7% within 4 weeks (6). However, antibiotic prophylaxis is not an
 ideal solution as the prevalence of antibiotic resistance among urinary bacterial isolates is
 very high and continues to increase. Escherichia coli is the most common urinary pathogen;
 among hospitalized patients in the US and Europe, ~10% E. coli from urinary-associated
 bacteremia had the extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, and ~26% were resistant
 
<section> Author to levofloxacin (7).
 
<section> The American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) has been widely used for the prevention
 
<section> Manuscript of urinary tract infections. Cranberry juice may prevent UTI by selecting against more
 adhesive strains in the stool, by directly preventing E. coli from adhering to uroepithelial
 cells, or by both of these mechanisms (8,9). Other effects might include influence on
 fimbrial subunit synthesis, assembly, or attachment; these effects would be similar to those
 seen with sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics (10). A 2012 systematic review and
 meta-analysis found an overall protective effect of cranberry on UTIs, but there was
 considerable heterogeneity in results across trials that varied in dose administered,
 population study, and sample size (11).
 
<section> No previous studies of cranberry have addressed effectiveness in reducing risk of UTI post
 
<section> Author
 
<section> catheterization. We begin to fill this gap by conducting a randomized clinical trial of the
 effectiveness of cranberry juice capsules in preventing UTI among women undergoing
 
<section> Manuscript elective gynecologic surgery where a catheter is in place. This is an especially high risk
 group as these operations involve surgery adjacent to the bladder and delayed bladder
 emptying is common. Because catheter insertion and removal introduces bacteria and causes
 trauma that may increase UTI risk, we also take into account frequency of intermittent
 catheterization following removal of the Foley catheter. 
<section> MATERIALS AND METHODS
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Study Design
 
<section> We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the therapeutic
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> efficacy of two cranberry juice capsules two times a day, equivalent to two 8-ounce servings
 of cranberry juice, for 6 weeks after elective gynecological surgery, in preventing UTI post
 catheterization.
 
<section> The Institutional Review Board at the University of Michigan approved the study protocol;
 all participants gave written informed consent. The use of cranberry capsules for this trial
 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (IND 111959); ClinicalTrials.gov
 identifier NCT01346774.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> Author
 
<section> We recruited study participants between August 2, 2011 and January 23, 2013 from patients
 referred by physicians from the Urogynecology and Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS)
 
<section> Manuscript clinics of the University of Michigan Division of Gynecology at the time of their pre-
 operative visit for elective gynecologic surgery. The Urogynecology clinic specializes in the
 surgical management of pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence and anal incontinence;
 the MIS clinic specializes in the surgical management of fibroids, endometriosis and pelvic
 pain. All surgeries were performed at within the University of Michigan Hospital System
 and followed the hospital’s standard operating procedures.
 
<section> Eligibility criteria
 
<section> Eligible participants were non-pregnant women at least 18 years of age without a history of
 
<section> Author nephrolithiasis, congenital urogenital anomaly or neurogenic bladder, any known allergy to
 cranberry products, who did not require therapeutic anticoagulant medicine during the six
 weeks after surgery, or whose surgery did not involve a fistula repair or vaginal mesh
 
<section> Manuscript 
<section> removal.
 
<section> Endpoints
 
<section> The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who experienced clinically-
 diagnosed and treated UTI whether or not results from a urine culture were available.
 Diagnosis and treatment were up to the treating physician. Secondary endpoints included the
 incidence of UTI caused by E. coli and time from randomization to UTI. Safety endpoints
 included adverse events and serious adverse events.
 
<section> Author 
<section> Therapeutic Regimen
 TheraCran ® cranberry and placebo capsules were provided by Theralogix, LLC (Rockville,
 MD), gratis, asking only that results be made available to them at time of publication. Based
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> upon proanthocyanidin content, the four cranberry capsules are equivalent to two 8-ounce
 servings of cranberry juice. 
<section> Administration
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Participants were directed to take two capsules by mouth twice each day (once in the
 morning and once in the evening) starting at time of discharge for 4–6 weeks, or until their
 
<section> Manuscript return for their post-operative doctor’s visit. Participants were instructed to drink an 8 oz
 glass of water while taking the capsule with or without food.
 
<section> Concomitant Medications, Foods and Beverages
 Participants were instructed not to consume any cranberry products (including whole fruit,
 jellies, juices or dietary supplement capsules containing cranberry), or vitamin C
 supplements beyond the assigned regimen. Compliance was assessed at each follow-up
 contact.
 
<section> Randomization
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Participants were randomized at time of surgery, a median of 18.5 days following
 enrollment (range 0 to 146 days). As bacteriuria increases with age, we balanced treatment
 
<section> Manuscript groups by age (< 60 v. > 60 years), based on the expected median age of our study
 population. Stratified randomization (1:1 Theracran® cranberry capsules:placebo) was
 performed using computer-generated permuted blocks, with a block size known only to the
 Data Coordinating Center. The Data Coordinating Center provided a randomization
 schedule for the supplier who printed labels that were placed on each bottle of capsules.
 
<section> After participants were deemed eligible, study coordinators performed the randomization
 using the next available randomization number on a stratum-specific list provided by the
 DCC.
 
<section> Author 
<section> Masking
 
<section> All study personnel (with the exception of designated individuals at the Data Coordinating
 Center), treating physicians, and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> Investigational Drug Service at the University of Michigan stored and managed the capsules,
 and conducted drug accountability.
 
<section> Study Procedures and Data Collection
 After giving informed consent, each participant completed a self-administered questionnaire
 regarding her medical and sexual history, health behaviors and symptoms. Following
 hospital admission, a urine specimen was collected upon catheter insertion in the operating
 room, and catheter removal (from the catheter port). At the time of hospital discharge,
 research staff provided the participant with enough capsules for 8 weeks of the assigned
 
<section> Author
 
<section> regimen, and administered the first dose. Participants were reminded to take the cranberry
 capsules daily, continuing 2×/day until their post-operative visit, usually at six weeks.
 Research staff also instructed participants to collect a urine sample if they experienced
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> urinary symptoms consistent with UTI (painful urination, an urgent need to urinate, pain/
 pressure in lower abdomen or pubic area, fever of 100 F or more, or flank pain), provided a
 urine collection kit (containing a preservative), orders for a urine culture (if needed) that
 included instructions to the laboratory to forward results to the treating physician at the 
<section> University of Michigan Health System if the culture was performed elsewhere, and written
 
<section> Author instructions for at-home urine collection. Participants were given a symptom diary to record
 any urinary symptoms.
 
<section> Manuscript Participants were advised to contact research staff immediately and to collect a urine
 specimen should they experience urinary symptoms consistent with UTI. When participants
 contacted research staff, they were administered a brief structured interview regarding the
 type and duration of symptoms and referred to their physicians for diagnosis and treatment.
 Urine was cultured using standard microbiologic techniques for the presence of
 uropathogens at the clinical laboratory selected by their treating physician. Study staff
 contacted participants within three days, and at two and four weeks after hospital discharge
 to assess compliance to study protocol, to identify if the participant had urinary symptoms
 consistent with UTI, and to elicit any adverse events. These items were also assessed at the
 
<section> Author week post-operative doctor’s visit using a self-administered questionnaire. At study exit,
 capsule bottles were collected so capsules could be counted to assess compliance.
 
<section> Manuscript Medical records of all randomized study participants were reviewed to identify any missed
 post-operative symptomatic UTI episodes, adverse events, and medications prescribed. All
 study participants received an intravenous antibiotic administration prior to the start of the
 surgical procedure, including urinary catheter insertion (as per hospital protocol).
 
<section> There were no changes to the methods or trial outcomes after the trial began. There were no
 interim analyses or stopping guidelines.
 
<section> The study protocol, including definitions of adverse events, is available upon request.
 
<section> Author 
<section> Statistical Methods
 
<section> Sample size was based on logistical and statistical principles. Estimates of the incidence of
 symptomatic UTI in our patient population were unavailable and thus we assumed the UTI
 
<section> Manuscript rate to be similar to that in the literature for patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (15–
 18%). (6) We believed we could enroll approximately 200 participants (100/treatment
 group) and calculated that this sample size would provide at least 80% power with a two-
 sided type I error of 5% to detect a large treatment difference (65% to 75% relative risk
 reduction) if the UTI rate was 15–20% in the placebo group (based on a two-sample
 binomial test, performed using EAST version 5.1, Cytel, 2007). Recruitment was stopped at
 160 randomized participants because of budgetary and timing constraints.
 
<section> Baseline socio-demographic and medical history characteristics were summarized using
 descriptive statistics. Primary analyses used an intent-to-treat approach. We used logistic
 
<section> Author
 
<section> regression to model the incidence of the primary endpoint and taking into account all pre-
 specified risk factors including age, UTI history, presence of a Foley catheter, and
 
<section> Manuscript intermittent self-catheterization. We also summarized treatment differences in time to UTI
 using Kaplan-Meier methods and tested these differences with logrank tests. A sensitivity
 analysis was performed for the primary endpoint, using a modified ITT analysis population
 that included only randomized participants who took at least one dose of study medication.
 In addition, we assessed treatment differences in culture-confirmed UTI, and culture- 
<section> confirmed when E. coli was the pathogen. We tested for differences in compliance and
 
<section> Author safety using the chi square test.
 
<section> All analyses were performed using SAS ® software, version 9.3.

<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Study Population
 
<section> 359 women presenting for elective gynecologic surgery were screened for eligibility
 between June 2011 and March 2013, of which 160 were randomized. Almost all (94%)
 received the allocated intervention (cranberry: 74/80 vs. placebo: 76/80). Reasons for not
 receiving the intervention included patient was discharged when staff were not available
 (n=2), the participant could not swallow the capsules or returned the bottle unopened (n=4),
 capsules were lost (n=1), participant’s physician told her to avoid cranberry (n=1), the
 
<section> Author
 
<section> surgery was cancelled (n=1) or the participant withdrew (n=1) (Figure 1). Follow-up was not
 statistically different by group: 73/80 (91%) of those allocated to cranberry and 72/80 (90%)
 
<section> Manuscript assigned to placebo completed at least one follow-up (p=0.79); and 41/80 (51%) of those
 allocated to cranberry and 32/80 (40%) allocated to placebo completed all 3 follow-ups. The
 primary endpoint was obtained for all randomized participants via review of medical
 records.
 
<section> Participants ranged in age from 23 to 88 years (mean ± SD for cranberry: 56 ±− 12.5;
 placebo: 56 ± 14.3). Socio-demographic characteristics and most medical history features
 were not statistically significantly different by treatment group (Table 1), including number
 of UTI in the 12 months prior to surgery (cranberry: 0.39 ± 0.88; placebo: 0.38 ± 0.80) and
 treating physician (data not shown). However, those assigned to cranberry were significantly
 
<section> Author less likely to have required intermittent self-catheterization during the recovery period (31%
 versus 50%; p=0.02), and reported a lower number of self-catheterization episodes per day
 (cranberry 3.7 ± 3.1 vs. placebo 5.5 + 4.9; p=0.08).. Participants who self-catheterized were
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> more likely to have a history of UTI (72% vs. 54%; p=0.01; data not shown). Seven women
 used an indwelling Foley catheter at home for part of the follow-up period (cranberry: n=3,
 placebo: n=4). The decision to discharge a patient with intermittent self-catheterization or a
 Foley was left to the individual physicians. Patients discharged with a Foley usually are
 unable to perform catheterize or decline to do so.
 
<section> Association of cranberry with UTI
 Overall, 45 (28%) of the 160 participants had a UTI. The incidence of UTI was significantly
 lower in the cranberry than the placebo group (15/80 (19%) versus 30/80 (38%); OR=0.38;
 
<section> Author 95% CI: 0.19, 0.79; p=0.008). Among participants with a UTI diagnosis, the percentage of
 those confirmed by culture did not differ between the women assigned placebo or cranberry
 (77% (23/35) vs 80% (12/15), p=0.31). The association remained significant when the
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> endpoint was limited to those with culture confirmed diagnosis (>10 3 cfu/mL urine (12))
 
<section> (OR=0.44, P=0.037).
 
<section> The median time to UTI was significantly longer among those in the cranberry than the
 placebo group (18 days versus 8.5 days, Figure 2, log rank test p=0.0005). When 
<section> considering only those patients with culture-confirmed UTI, the incidence of UTI was also
 
<section> Author significantly lower in the cranberry than the placebo group (12/80 (15%) versus 23/80
 (29%), OR=0.44; 0.20, 0.96; p=0.04). Results did not change in the sensitivity analysis
 using the modified intent to treat analysis population, which excluded the ten participants
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> who did not take a single dose of study medication.
 
<section> The beneficial effect of cranberry treatment remained after adjusting for frequency of post-
 operative self-catheterization and having an indwelling Foley catheter at home in a logistic
 regression model (OR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.94; p=0.037) (Table 2). Women who self-
 catheterized during the post-operative period had a significantly higher incidence of UTI
 (33/65 (51%) versus 12/95 (13%) (OR=7.13; 95% CI: 3.28, 15.5; p<<0.001), but there was
 no interaction between frequency of self-catheterization and treatment (p=0.63). Further, of
 the 7 participants with an indwelling catheter for part or all of the post-operative recovery
 
<section> Author period, 1/3 assigned to cranberry and 3/4 assigned to placebo had a UTI. (The one woman
 who had a Foley catheter throughout the entire study period developed a UTI based on
 endpoint criteria). The increased risk of UTI associated with discharge with an indwelling
 
<section> Manuscript Foley catheter remained after adjusting for frequency of intermittent catheterization
 following Foley removal during the post-operative period and the effects of cranberry
 (OR=7.3; 95% CI: 1.42, 42.07; p=0.018 (Table 2)). There was no association between UTI
 history (both in the previous 12 months and any time during life) and UTI risk post-surgery
 (data not shown).
 
<section> Escherichia coli was the most common infecting organism (cranberry: 38%; placebo: 46%
 (Table 3)). Considering only those with a UTI caused by E. coli, the risk of UTI among
 those taking cranberry was reduced by an estimated 62% (OR=0.38; 95% CI: 0.13, 1.13;
 p=0.07). The second most common infecting bacterial species was Klebsiella pneumoniae
 
<section> Author
 
<section> among the cranberry group (23%) and Enterococcus among the placebo group (23%). The
 vast majority of cultures had ≥10 5 cfu/mL urine of the infecting bacteria (92% for cranberry
 and 81% for placebo) and all urine cultures had at least one species occurring at >10
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> cfu/mL urine; four positive cultures reported two bacterial species).
 
<section> Compliance
 
<section> The average amount of time from a participant’s surgery, when they started study drug, to
 their termination from the study was 38 days (SD: 24, Range: 0–227). At study exit, of the
 130 participants with information available, 110 (85%) reported taking two capsules twice a
 day, most or all of the time. Most participants reported following the prescribed regimen at
 the 2-week (89%) and 4-week (82%) follow-up contacts. Pill counts were available for a
 similar number of participants by treatment assignment (cranberry: n= 57, placebo: n=60);
 
<section> Author
 
<section> participants averaged three capsules per day in both treatment groups. Compliance was not
 statistically significantly different by treatment group using any measure of compliance.
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> Adverse effects
 
<section> The proportion of participants with AEs and SAEs did not differ by treatment groups
 (p=0.28, p=1.00). Seventy-five participants experienced 328 adverse events in the cranberry
 group, and 78 participants experienced 423 in the placebo group. Four participants 
<section> experienced 5 severe adverse events in the cranberry group and 4 participants experience
 
<section> Author adverse events in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal upset was the most commonly reported
 event in both groups (cranberry: n=45 (56%); placebo: 49 (61%)).

<section> COMMENT
 
<section> This is the first report of a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial
 demonstrating a statistically and clinically significant benefit of taking cranberry in
 preventing UTI after elective gynecologic surgery where a urinary catheter is placed. This
 reduction in UTI risk is similar in magnitude to that reportedly obtained by administering
 antibiotics at time of catheter removal (6), and avoids the collateral damage associated with
 antibiotic use, including pressure for antibiotic resistance.
 
<section> Our study addresses the major limitations identified in previous studies of the effects of
 
<section> Author
 
<section> cranberry products (13). We compared cranberry capsules to placebo; sub-analyses of
 previous trials suggest capsules are somewhat more effective than juice, perhaps because of
 increased compliance (11). In our previous cranberry trial conducted among college students
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> where we used juice, the placebo juice contained similar levels of vitamin C to that found in
 cranberry juice. We observed no effect of cranberry in that trial, perhaps because vitamin C
 has been observed to have a beneficial effect on UTI risk (14).
 
<section> Several strengths in the study design and analysis of this trial make it unlikely that the
 difference in outcome was due to (alpha) error. The design, conduct and analysis of the
 trials, including randomization scheme, blinding of study personnel and participants, and
 active surveillance for outcomes were held to the highest standards. Furthermore, after
 analyses taking into account known risk factors - need for intermittent self-catheterization,
 
<section> Author UTI history and age - UTI history age - the findings remained consistent with cranberry
 mitigating the risk for UTI. This suggests that our results might be generalized to women
 undergoing laparoscopic or vaginal surgery for benign gynecologic procedures where a
 
<section> Manuscript 
<section> catheter is placed.
 
<section> Developing practices to reduce UTI risk is a promising area for quality improvement.
 Considering the use of intermittent catheterization is a potential example. Each time a
 catheter is inserted, the bladder is inoculated with bacteria, and there is some subtle trauma,
 increasing risk of infection. Amongst the 65 women that reported intermittent
 catheterization, the median number of times was 15 (mean of 32; range 1 to 216 times)
 during the postoperative period. Developing patient education to reduce the daily number of
 times that intermittent catheterization is undertaken might reduce UTI risk. Moreover, our
 results suggest that discharging a patient from the hospital with an indwelling catheter in
 
<section> Author
 
<section> place should be avoided if possible. These women experienced a seven-fold increase in UTI
 risk after adjusting for cranberry use and frequency of intermittent catheterization.
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> Future studies might aim to optimize the time of catheter insertion and removal, and to
 develop strategies to reduce the frequency of intermittent catheterization. At least one
 previous trial compared different timings of urinary catheter removal following abdominal
 hysterectomy. The risks of postoperative urinary retention and over-distension need to be 
<section> weighed against UTI risk. Removal immediately following surgery was associated with
 
<section> Author increased urinary retention, and removal after 24 hours with increased risk of UTI; removal
 at 6 hours resulted in the fewest adverse events (15). Strategies to decrease the length of
 time associated with catheterization may need to be carefully considered in each case but are
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> promising areas to decrease this morbidity.

 Of the 45 participants who had a primary outcome (UTI) culture results were not available for 10 participants (cranberry: n=3, placebo: n=7) with
 clinically diagnosed and treated urinary tract infection. Numbers may not sum to totals, as more than one species was present in 4 cultures
 (cranberry: n=1, placebo: n=3). Greater than 104 cfu/mL urine of a potential uropathogen were detected in all positive cultures. In the culture
 positive for yeast, there were 105 cfu/mL urine; the culture positive for Lactobacillus (10 3 cfu/mL urine) also had 5 cfu/mL urine of E. coli.
 There were 5 cfu/mL urine reported for the ‘mixed’ culture.
