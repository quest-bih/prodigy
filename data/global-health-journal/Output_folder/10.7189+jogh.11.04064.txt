 sugar consumption: A
 controlled trial
 
<section> Background Short and animated story-based (SAS) videos, which can be rap-
 idly distributed through social media channels, are a novel and promising strat-
 egy for promoting health behaviors. In this study, we evaluate the effective-
 ness of a SAS video intervention to reduce the consumption of added sugars.
 
<section> Methods In December 2020, we randomized 4159 English-speaking partici-
 pants from the United Kingdom (1:1:1) to a sugar intervention video, a con-
 tent placebo video about sunscreen use (no sugar message), or a placebo video
 about earthquakes (no health or sugar message). We nested six list experiments
 in each arm and randomized participants (1:1) to a control list or a control list
 plus an item about consuming added sugars. The primary end-points were
 mean differences (on a scale of 0-100) in behavioral intent and direct resto-
 ration of freedom to consume added sugars.
 
<section> Results Participants (N = 4013) who watched the sugar video had significantly
 higher behavioral intent to cut their daily intake of added sugar (mean differ-
 ence (md) = 16.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-31.8, P = 0.031), eat fresh
 fruit daily (md = 16.7, 95% CI = 0.5-32.9, P = 0.043), and check food labels for
 sugar content (md = 20.5, 95% CI = 2.6-38.5, P = 0.025) when compared with
 the sunscreen (content placebo) video. The sugar video did not arouse intent
 to restore freedom and consume added sugars when compared with the two
 placebo videos.
 
<section> Conclusions Our SAS intervention video did not arouse reactance and in-
 creased short-term behavioral intent among participants to reduce their con-
 sumption of added sugars. SAS videos, which draw on best practices from the
 entertainment-education media, communication theory, and the animation in-
 dustry, can be an effective strategy for delivering emotionally compelling nar-
 ratives to promote health behavior change.

 Short and animated story-based (SAS) videos are a novel and promising strategy
 for promoting health behaviors. This strategy draws from entertainment-education
 media [1,2], communication theory, and the animation industry [3] to create com-
 pelling, evidence-based health messages that virtually ‘go viral’ [4]. SAS videos can
 be developed and rapidly deployed on social media channels, avoiding the delays
 typically associated with sluggish public health campaigns [5-8]. Importantly, SAS
 videos can creatively sidestep social barriers and convey health messages that are
 accessible across languages, ages, cultural affiliations, and education levels [4,5]. 
<insert> Figure 1. An Intertwined Process Cognitive-Affective Model adapted from Dillard & Shen [14] and Zhang [17]. In this model, there are two
 antecedents to reactance: strength of the threat to freedom and trait proneness to reactance. Reactance is conceptualized as a mediator be-
 tween the antecedents of reactance and behavioral intent to undertake the promoted health activity. It is an intertwined process consisting
 of a cognitive and affective component, which is an experience of hostile, aggressive or angry feelings. Further, attitudinal and behavioral
 intentions are the consequences of reactance. The assessment of behavioral intentions can also help to measure direct restoration of free-
 dom, which involves performing the forbidden behavior and restoring participant’s need for self-determination and control. 
<iend>

 Research has shown that packaging health recommendations in a relatable story can be more effective than
 traditional media approaches that frame health messages as informational arguments [9,10]. To gain further
 traction as a health communication tool, SAS videos must demonstrate their impact in reducing the knowledge
 translation gap and improving intent toward the targeted health behavior [11,12].
 
<section> To be effective, SAS videos will have to overcome the same challenges faced by other traditional methods of
 health persuasion [13]. These methods often fail to achieve the desired effect [14], and in some cases, may
 arouse a motivation to reject a message, a phenomenon known as reactance [15]. The theory of reactance pos-
 its that individuals will seek to restore their freedom – after it has been eliminated or threatened with elimi-
 nation – by performing the forbidden act [16]. In 
<section> Figure 1, we show a pathway through which a persuasive
 health message can arouse the direct restoration of freedom [14-17]. This conceptual model also shows how
 a persuasive message is mediated by the antecedents, components, and consequences of reactance to affect
 behavioral intent. A SAS intervention video should aim to attenuate direct restoration and increase intent to-
 ward the promoted health behavior.
 
<section> In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of a SAS video to reduce the consumption of added sugars [18].
 The excessive intake of added sugars has increased worldwide and been associated with numerous adverse
 health outcomes, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [19]. Several interventions
 have used social media channels to distribute video-based messages about the harmful effects of added sugars.
 However, a recent systematic review of 34 interventions found that only one-third provided some form of ed-
 ucational information about how to substitute added sugars with alternatives [20]. Other added sugar studies
 have included non-animated, web-based videos, such as a puppet show [21], an expert opinion intercut with
 case studies [22], video courses [23], and storytelling interviews [24]. These interventions ranged from ap-
 proximately 6-15 minutes in duration, which is longer than the optimal time required for a social media format
 [21-24]. In addition, the interventions were specific to demographic groups (eg, Filipinos, Taiwanese, Somalis,
 and Latinos) and populations (eg, children, patients with type 2 diabetes, mothers, and cultural minorities) [21-
 24]. One recent study reports that a non-narrative based health message produced significantly higher behav-
 ioral intent to limit sugar intake than the narrative based comparison [25], while other studies have reported
 positive changes in health-related behaviors after exposure to narrative-based video interventions [9,26,27].
 To evaluate the effectiveness of our intervention, we used a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assign par-
 ticipants to a SAS video about reducing added sugar intake, or a SAS video about sunscreen use (the content
 placebo), or a SAS video about earthquakes (the placebo). We hypothesize that the exposure to the interven-
 tion video will improve behavioral intent to reduce the consumption of added sugars when compared to the
 content placebo and placebo videos. Intervention effectiveness will be measured by higher behavioral intent
 scores in the sugar intervention arm. We also hypothesize that the exposure to the intervention video will at-
 tenuate the direct restoration of freedom to consume added sugars when compared to the content placebo and
 placebo videos. No statistically significant difference in the direct restoration scores between the intervention
 and placebo videos will indicate intervention effectiveness. The findings from this study will provide insights
 for the understanding of reactance-related processes and their effect on behavioral intent in health promotion. Story-based, animated video to reduce added sugar consumption
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Trial design
 
<section> In this web-based RCT, we randomized participants 1:1:1 to a SAS video about added sugars (the intervention
 arm), a SAS video about sunscreen use (the content placebo arm), and a SAS video about earthquakes (the
 placebo arm). We nested six list experiments in each trial arm. For each list experiment, we randomized par-
 ticipants 1:1 to a control or treatment group. We motivate our use of the content placebo and placebo arms as
 well as the list experiment in the Procedures section.
 
<section> Trial registration
 
<section> This study was registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (www.drks.de) on July th , 2020:
 DRKS00022340.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> We used the Prolific platform to recruit the web-based study participants. Inclusion criteria included being be-
 tween the ages of 18 and 59 years (male, female, or other), being able to speak English, and having residence
 in the United Kingdom (UK). Exclusion criteria were not any of the inclusion criteria. We recruited partici-
 pants on a ‘first come, first served’ basis until the recruitment number (sample size) was reached. Participants
 were provided with an informed consent form on the Prolific platform, which explained the purpose of the
 study, the risks and benefits of the research, and a means by which a participant could contact the research-
 er or the human subjects review board at Heidelberg University. After consenting, Prolific redirected partici-
 pants to the Gorilla platform, where the study was hosted. Gorilla is a cloud platform that provides versatile
 tools to undertake web-based, experimental, and behavioral research. We paid participants £1 (US$1.38) for
 the 10-minute completion time.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> Participants were asked basic demographic questions about their age, gender, and highest education complet-
 ed. The Gorilla algorithm then randomly assigned participants to the trial arms. Participants watched one SAS
 video once from start to finish.
 
<section> The sugar intervention video is animated, completely in English, and 3.42 minutes long. It was developed by
 our co-author (MA) at the Stanford School of Medicine and designed for a diverse and global audience. The
 two main characters, a mother and her pre-adolescent daughter, engage in food-related activities, such as gro-
 cery shopping and cooking dinner. The sugar video presents educational content on health problems that arise
 from consuming added sugars in foods, such as yoghurt, chocolate milk, and breakfast cereals. The narrative
 also includes the story of the father in this family who dies from diabetes-associated complications from the
 frequent consumption of soda drinks. It concludes with a text message from the World Health Organization
 (WHO) about the recommended maximum number of teaspoons of sugar per day.
 The content placebo video is similar in style to the sugar video: it is animated, has a length of 3.42 minutes,
 and promotes a health message about the use of sunscreen [28]. We use the content placebo video to isolate
 the content effect of the sugar intervention video as it does not include the content about added sugars. The
 placebo video about earthquakes [29] is also animated and has the same length as the sugar and sunscreen
 videos. It describes the causes and characteristics of earthquakes and contains no health-related message or
 added sugar message. Since the Sunscreen video promotes a health message and the Earthquake video does
 not, we attribute any significant difference in the end-points (following random assignment) to the content of
 the sunscreen message. We call this difference the health awareness effect. The total intervention effect is there-
 fore the sum of the content and health awareness effects.
 
<section> After random assignment, all participants provided responses to questions about threat to freedom (the an-
 tecedent to reactance), anger and negative cognition (the components of reactance), and source appraisal and
 attitude (the consequences of reactance), as shown in 
<section> Figure 1 and described elsewhere [30,31]. All reactance
 components were measured on a 5-point Likert scale: (1) strongly disagree; (2) disagree; (3) neither agree nor
 disagree; (4) agree; (5) strongly agree [32].
 
<section> To reduce socially desirable responses to the behavioral intent and direct restoration questions, we nested six
 list experiments in each arm. 
<section> Table 1 shows the six list experiments and their items. We randomized par-
 ticipants to either a control or treatment group. The control group received a list of five items and the treat-

 efficients from the OLS model. For hypothesis testing for the difference in means, we used a t-distribution and
 set a significance level at 0.05. Using regression models specifically designed for list experiments, we modelled
 the effect of each reactance component on behavioral intent [34]. We used all of the above procedures for the
 direct restoration experiments (List 2, 4, 6). Notation for the end-point calculations can be found in the Sup-
 plement and the sample size calculation has been described elsewhere [30]. All statistical analyses were per-
 formed using the statistical software R (version 4.0) (Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
 
<section> Protocol
 
<section> The full protocol has been published and can be accessed at any time [30].
 
<section> Availability of data and materials
 
<section> Data has been collected and stored on the Gorilla platform. The study investigators own and have complete
 control of the research data, which can be accessed at any time. For statistical analysis, the data was download-
 ed and is safely stored on a computing system maintained by the Heildelberg University.
 
<section> Blinding
 
<section> The participants were completely anonymous to the study investigators as the Prolific platform handled the in-
 teraction between the study investigators and participants. Only the participant’s unique, anonymized ID was
 used to manage the linking between the Prolific and Gorilla platforms. The outcome measures were self-re-
 ported and submitted anonymously. The study investigators and those involved in the data analyses were
 blinded to the group allocation.
 
<section> Adverse event reporting and harms
 
<section> Because the participants were anonymous to us, we were not able to report any adverse events or harms. It is
 unlikely there were any adverse events given the format of our 10-minute web-based trial.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> We recruited 4159 participants from the UK on the th and 10 th December 2020. After enrollment, 146 (3.5%)
 participants did not finish the trial either due to technical reasons (poor internet connection, video
 loading issues, system crash, etc.) or other unknown reasons. In total, 4013 participants (96.4% of the
 recruited sam-ple) completed the trial and were included in the final analysis (Figure 2). We present the

<section> final sample, 60.9% were female, 32.3% were between 25-34 years of age, and 64.1% had some college ed-
 ucation or a Bachelor's degree. We observed no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics
 across the three trial arms.
 
<section> The mean scores for the six list experiments by trial arm and list treatment group are shown in Figure S1 in the
 
<section> Online Supplementary Document. The difference in mean scores between the treatment and control groups
 gives the prevalence of behavioral intent (Lists 1, 3, 5) and intent to restore freedom (Lists 2, 4, 6) toward added
 sugar intake. Scores in the treatment group (6 items) are higher than in the control group (5 items) because of
 one additional item. These differences represent the prevalence toward behavioral intent or direct restoration
 of freedom. For example, in List 1 (of Figure S1 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document), the mean score
 for the intervention arm is 2.7 for the treatment group and 2.31 for the control group. Therefore, the preva-
 lence of behavioral intent to cut the daily intake of added sugar is 39% (2.7-2.31 × 100).
 
<section> In 
<section> Figure 3, we compare behavioral intent (List 1, 3, 5) to reduce added sugars (after removing social desir-
 ability bias) between the sugar, sunscreen, and earthquake videos. Results show that participants who watched
 the sugar video had significantly higher behavioral intent to cut their daily intake of added sugar (16.7, 95%
 
<section> CI = 1.5-31.8, P = 0.031), eat fresh fruit daily (16.7, 95% CI = 0.5-32.9, P = 0.043), and check food labels for
 sugar content (20.5, 95% CI = 2.6-38.5, P = 0.025) than those in the content placebo arm. We also observed
 high behavioral intent to reduce the intake of added sugars between the sugar and earthquake videos but
 these differences were not statistically different. In 
<section> Figure 3, we compare behavioral intent to restore freedom
 (Lists 2, 4, 6) between the sugar, sunscreen, and earthquake videos. We show that there were no statistically
 significant differences between the three videos, which implies that the sugar video did not arouse reactance
 to the sugar message.
 
<section> For each list experiment, we also assessed the effect of the six reactance components on behavioral intent and
 direct restoration. More detailed results for the antecedents, components, and consequences of reactance are
 presented elsewhere [31]. The plots in 
<section> Figure 4 show how behavioral intent (Lists 1, 3, 5) and direct resto-
 ration (Lists 2, 4, 6) change for a 1 unit increase in each reactance component. Results show that participants
 who had a higher source appraisal score (eg, ‘The narrator of this video was knowledgeable’) and a more fa-
 vourable attitude score (eg, ‘I agree with what the message recommends’) toward the sugar message were more
 likely to have higher behavioral intent to reduce their consumption of added sugars. Participants who perceived
 the message to be threatening (eg, ‘The message threatened my freedom to choose’), or who were angered by
 the message (eg, ‘This message makes me feel angry’) or had negative cognition (eg, ‘The thoughts I had while
 watching this video were mostly negative’), or reactance (both anger and negative cognition) were more un-
 motivated to reduce their consumption of added sugars. Thus, participants with higher scores on these four
 components were more likely to reject the sugar message. In addition, as the source appraisal and attitude
 scores decreased, the intent to restore freedom increased (except for List 2 in 
<section> Figure 4). 
<insert> Figure 3. Prevalence of behavioral intent (Lists 1, 3, 5) and direct restoration (Lists 2, 4, 6) with 95% CIs by trial arm. The results show that
 the prevalence of behavioral intent to reduce added sugars was significantly higher among participants who watched the sugar intervention
 video, compared to participants in the two placebo arms (Lists 1, 3, 5). We also show that the sugar intervention video aroused lower mo-
 tivation to restore freedom when compared with the two placebo videos (Lists 2, 4, 6), although these differences were not statistically sig-
 nificant (which is further evidence in support of the effectiveness of the intervention).

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> Short and animated (SAS) videos present a promising and effective strategy for promoting healthy behaviors.
 Such videos can engage large and diverse audiences in evidence-based health education because they use a
 story format, are emotionally compelling, and can be rapidly distributed through social media channels. Since
 health education is a cornerstone for changing behaviors, it is crucial to improve the design of SAS videos to
 increase the long-term impact of such interventions. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of a SAS vid-
 eo to improve behavioral intent to reduce the consumption of added sugars and to attenuate the direct resto-
 ration of freedom to consume added sugars.
 
<section> Our results show that participants who watched the sugar video had significantly higher behavioral intent to
 reduce added sugars when compared with those who watched the sunscreen (content placebo) video. Specif-
 ically, participants who watched the sugar video were more motivated to cut their daily intake of added sug-
 ar, eat fresh fruit daily, and check food labels for sugar content. For these three sugar-related behaviors, be-
 havioral intent was approximately 16% higher than the sunscreen video and 12% higher than the earthquake
 video. Based on these results, we find evidence in favour of our first hypothesis, which states that exposure to
 the sugar intervention will improve behavioral intent to reduce the consumption of added sugars when com-
 pared to the placebo videos.
 
<section> In this study, we also investigated if participants were likely to reject the sugar message. We did this by mea-
 suring the participant’s attempt to restore their freedom. The theory of reactance posits that individuals will
 seek to restore their freedom after it has been threatened with elimination by the health message. Our results
 show that participants who watched the sugar video did not arouse intent to restore freedom significantly more
 or less than the placebo videos. Therefore, we cannot support our second hypothesis.
 An important contribution of our study is that we modelled the effect of the reactance components on behavior-
 al intent and direct restoration outcomes. This was made possible by recent advances in list regression methods
 [34]. Our analysis shows that positive appraisal of the source and a favorable attitude towards the sugar mes-
 sage resulted in higher behavioral intent and lower intent to restore freedom. On the other hand, participants
 who initially scored higher on the ‘negative’ components of the reactance (threat to freedom, anger, negative
 cognition) were less motivated to change their behavior and more willing to restore their freedom. The results
 of our study show that health messages that threaten one’s freedom and arouse reactance will be less success-
 ful at nudging a person toward the targeted health behavior.
 
<section> Our study has several strengths. First, we used an RCT design, which is the gold standard for evaluating the
 causal impact of an intervention on a health behavior outcome. Here, we randomized participants to either
 the sugar video intervention, a content placebo (the sunscreen video) or a placebo (the earthquake video). The
 content placebo is an innovative feature of our study, which enabled us to quantify the content effect as the
 difference in mean behavioral intent between the sugar video (the intervention) and the sunscreen video (the
 content placebo). Since both videos promote a health message, and because of randomization, any significant
 difference in mean scores should be due to the sugar reduction content of the intervention video. Similarly, we
 calculated the total intervention effect as the difference in mean scores between the sugar video and the earth-
 quake video (the placebo). We are not aware of any previous study that has used an experimental approach
 to partition the effect of a SAS intervention video in this way. A third strength is that we used list experiments
 to indirectly obtain truthful responses and reduce social desirability bias. Here, we assumed that most partic-
 ipants know that consuming added sugars is unhealthy and that they will give socially desirable responses.
 By asking participants to count their agreement with six items, we could indirectly estimate the prevalence of
 participants that truly intend (in the next week) to reduce their consumption of added sugars.
 In a previous study using the same data [31], we evaluated the effect of social authority on psychological re-
 actance to the same sugar video described in this study. We randomized participants to the same placebo vid-
 eos (sunscreen and earthquake) or the same sugar intervention video narrated by either a child (low social
 authority), the child’s mother (equivalent social authority), or the family doctor (high social authority). Our
 hypothesis was that a child narrator would arouse less reactance to the sugar message, because such a narrator
 would be perceived as less threatening or lacking an ‘ulterior motive’. We found no significant differences in
 reactance component scores between the three sugar narrators (child, mother, and doctor) [31]. For this study,
 we therefore treated the three narrated intervention videos as a single intervention video, thus explaining the
 higher number of participants randomized to the sugar video compared to the placebo videos.
 Our study has several limitations. One limitation is that we financially compensated participants, which was
 unavoidable given the web-based format of our study. Because of financial compensation, some studies may 
<section> attract economically disadvantaged participants, who will be disproportionately represented and may have
 less individual autonomy when given the choice for a lucrative incentive [35]. In our study, participants
 were paid £1 (US$1.38) for an expected 10-minute completion time, which is fair (and close to the UK min-
 imum wage of £6 (US$8.28) per hour for 18-20 year-olds) but not very lucrative [36]. Furthermore, given
 that 63.6% of the participants had a Bachelor’s degree (or some college) and 83.2% had a Bachelor’s degree
 or higher (MA, PhD), it is unlikely that our study disproportionately attracted vulnerable or economically
 disadvantaged participants. It is also widely accepted to compensate healthy participants when the research
 is not focused on a specific disease or treatment and does not involve potential risks [37]. Another limita-
 tion is that we were only able to assess short-term behavioral intent to reduce the consumption of added
 sugars. The impact of our sugar intervention on long-term behavioral change remains unknown. However,
 our results show a promising impact on short-term behavioral intent, which is a critical first step toward
 adopting a new behavior [38]. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that the sugar intervention aroused less
 (but not statistically significant) reactance when compared with the two placebo videos, which is a positive
 finding. This finding suggests that SAS videos can be an important component in the value chain of pro-
 moting health behaviors.
 
<section> CONCLUSIONS
 
<section> Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that our SAS intervention can successfully attenuate reactance
 and improve short-term behavioral intent to reduce the consumption of added sugars. Importantly, our SAS
 video did not arouse the participants’ motivation to restore their freedom, indicating the positive impact of
 the video on the behavioral change. In addition, the results of this study confirm that positive source appraisal
 and attitude towards the message can serve as reliable predictors of higher behavioral intent and lower free-
 dom restoration, whereas greater threat to freedom and reactance (composed of anger and negative cognition)
 may result in lower behavioral intent and higher freedom restoration. These findings can be further used to
 inform the design of SAS videos and are aligned with existing evidence about the use of powerful video-based
 messages in health communication [4,6,39]. This work contributes to a larger body of research investigating
 innovative approaches to digital health messaging that leverage best practices from communication theory,
 entertainment media, and health education. The goal of such innovation is to meet our audiences where they
 are (on social media) and to convey science-based health messages that are accessible and engaging across a
 broad spectrum of cultures, languages, ages, and educational backgrounds.
