<section> Abstract
 
<section> Behaviors related to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are key drivers of infectious dis-
 ease transmission, and experiences of WASH are potential influencers of mental well-
 being. Important knowledge gaps exist related to the content and delivery of effective
 WASH programs and their associated health impacts, particularly within the contexts of gov-
 ernment programs implemented at scale. We developed and tested a demand-side inter-
 vention called Andilaye, which aimed to change behaviors related to sanitation, personal
 hygiene, and household environmental sanitation. This theory-informed intervention was
 delivered through the existing Ethiopian Health Extension Programme (HEP). It was a multi-
 level intervention with a catalyzing event at the community level and behavior change activi-
 ties at group and household levels. We randomly selected and assigned 50 kebeles (sub-
 districts) from three woredas (districts), half to receive the Andilaye intervention, and half the
 standard of care sanitation and hygiene programming (i.e., community-led total sanitation
 and hygiene [CLTSH]). We collected data on WASH access, behavioral outcomes, and
 mental well-being. A total of 1,589 households were enrolled into the study at baseline;
 1,472 households (94%) participated in an endline assessment two years after baseline,
 and approximately 14 months after the initiation of a multi-level intervention. The interven-
 tion did not improve construction of latrines (prevalence ratio [PR]: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.21)
 or handwashing stations with water (PR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.26), or the removal of animal
 feces from the compound (PR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.28). Nor did it impact anxiety (PR:
 0.90; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.11), depression (PR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.07), emotional distress
 (PR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.09) or well-being (PR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.10) scores. We
 report limited impact of the intervention, as delivered, on changes in behavior and mental
 well-being. The effectiveness of the intervention was limited by poor intervention fidelity.

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are key drivers of infectious disease trans-
 mission [1, 2]. Diarrhea accounts for an estimated 1.65 million deaths annually [3] and nearly
 10% of all under-5 deaths in low-income settings [4]. Deficiencies in WASH are also a major
 contributor of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) [5, 6]. Over one billion people are at risk of
 soil-transmitted helminthiasis, which leads to nearly five million disability adjusted life years
 (DALYs), and schistosomiasis leads to two million DALYs [7, 8]. Trachoma, the leading infec-
 tious cause of blindness [9], is precipitated by repeat infections with Chlamydia trachomatis
 bacteria, which are often perpetuated by poor hygiene [10]. These infections are environmen-
 tally mediated [11], and are largely attributed to inadequate WASH [12, 13].
 While WASH studies have primarily focused on infectious diseases or anthropometric mea-
 sures of growth amongst young children, this narrow focus does not fully encapsulate the
 World Health Organization (WHO)’s definition of health as “a state of complete physical,
 mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” [14]. A grow-
 ing body of research has identified linkages between water and sanitation and mental health
 outcomes [14–17]. For example, extensive qualitative and quantitative research has demon-
 strated how water insecurity can influence mental health, particularly among women [18–21].
 Research on sanitation and mental health is emergent, and predominantly qualitative [22–24].
 A cross-sectional study in Odisha, India, found women’s sanitation insecurity—their negative
 sanitation experiences and concerns—to be associated with stress, depression, distress, and
 impaired general well-being, even among those with access to a sanitation facility [25]. Fur-
 ther, a systematic review of sanitation and well-being found open defecation and use of sanita-
 tion facilities can negatively influence mental and social well-being for women and girls,
 especially when they experience or perceive a lack of privacy and safety [14]. As such, improve-
 ments in women’s mental health likely requires more than physical access to sanitation facili-
 ties, but also gender-sensitive modifications to facilities and shifts in gender norms to improve
 women’s experiences of sanitation [23, 25]. To date, limited research has assessed the impact
 of water interventions on mental health outcomes [26], and few studies have assessed the
 impact of sanitation interventions on mental health outcomes [14].
 Despite the urgent need to improve sanitation and hygiene—including the target of univer-
 sal basic access to sanitation as part of Sustainable Development Goal target 6.2—many large-
 scale sanitation interventions have shown poor uptake and sustainability [27], as well as mixed
 impacts on health [1]. Without sustained sanitation and hygiene behavior change, health gains
 are unlikely.
 Community-led total sanitation (CLTS) has been heralded as a low-cost approach to
 improve community coverage of sanitation [28]. CLTS uses a demand-side approach—pro-
 moting the demand to execute improved sanitation behaviors, rather than supply-side 
<section> provision of infrastructure—that involves engaging the community, typically via an initial
 “triggering” event, to become open defecation free (ODF) through community-activities and
 local champions. Rigorous evaluations of CLTS, like those of other sanitation interventions,
 have yielded mixed health effects [29–31]. To date, there is mixed evidence on the potential
 CLTS to achieve and sustain changes to WASH coverage and access [32–35]. Engaging local
 champions in CLTS delivery may yield beneficial results. Program delivery through Health
 Extension Workers (HEW) and the engagement of teachers both led to substantial improve-
 ments in sanitation coverage and use [34], although less than when delivered by trained natu-
 ral leaders in Ghana [32]; yet these gains were not well sustained [36].
 There are several documented limitations of community-led total sanitation and hygiene
 (CLTSH), a variation of CLTS that incorporates hygiene-related interventions. HEWs charged
 with implementing CLTSH have many responsibilities, limited incentives and motivations,
 few tools, and little capacity to continually reinforce messages [37]. The use of negative affec-
 tive motivators employed by CLTS(H) may not be culturally appropriate or the most effective
 drivers of sanitation and hygiene behavior change [38], and may erode mental well-being.
 Together, the focus on negative affective motivators, poor facilitation of initial triggering, and
 a lack of follow-up, has left many communities with negative impressions of CLTSH initiatives
 [39].
 In Ethiopia, CLTSH, which has been implemented widely through the Ethiopian Health
 Extension Programme (HEP), relies chiefly on negative affective motives (e.g., shame, disgust)
 to drive open defecation cessation. However, like prior evaluations of CLTS, evidence suggests
 that CLTSH is largely ineffective, with one out of six Ethiopian households continuing to prac-
 tice open defecation after their respective villages were certified as ODF [40].
 We designed a study to generate evidence to address knowledge gaps related to demand-
 side sanitation and hygiene programming and examine less studied, yet critical, inter-personal
 factors related to sustained behavioral adoption and downstream health impacts [41]. Specifi-
 cally, we conducted a cluster-randomized trial (CRT) to test whether an intervention delivered
 at scale within the existing Ethiopian HEP would lead to sustained WASH behavior change
 and improved mental health. Leveraging feedback received from community members and
 key stakeholders, we designed a theoretically-informed [42–44] and evidence-based demand-
 side sanitation and hygiene intervention called Andilaye—Amharic for “togetherness/integra-
 tion.” The intervention takes a positive, encouragement approach to behavior change by pro-
 moting incremental improvements in behavior and incorporating behavioral maintenance
 strategies to foster sustained behavior change.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> The study’s primary aim was to determine whether a demand-side sanitation and hygiene
 intervention (Andilaye) impacted WASH behavior change and mental health, specifically gen-
 eral well-being and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and non-specific emotional distress. A
 protocol detailing the methods, intervention, and baseline results are published elsewhere [41].
 
<section> Ethics and trial registration
 
<section> Ethical approval for the Andilaye Trial was provided by Emory University (IRB00076141), the
 London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (9595), and locally by the Amhara Regional
 Health Bureau (HRTT0135909). The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov
 (NCT03075436) on March 9, 2017. Approval was obtained at district and sub-district govern-
 ment offices. Informed consent was obtained orally at each household due to low literacy rates 
<section> of the population and concerns about historically coercive practices which including obtaining
 signatures. Oral consent was approved by all ethics boards.
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> This parallel CRT was conducted in West Gojjam and South Gondar Zones of the Amhara
 National Regional State, a region of Ethiopia in which WASH conditions are inadequate [45],
 slippage in sanitation coverage and improved sanitation behaviors has been documented, and
 several NTDs (e.g., soil-transmitted helminths, trachoma) are hyperendemic [46]. Three dis-
 tricts (woredas)—Bahir Dar Zuria Woreda in West Gojjam Zone and Fogera and Farta Wore-
 das in South Gondar Zone—were targeted for this study and represent a range of the
 topographical conditions present in Amhara, and Ethiopia in general. We targeted specific
 behaviors, including sanitation (constructing, maintaining, and using a latrine), personal
 hygiene (handwashing at key times and face washing), and household environmental sanita-
 tion (keeping animals separate from living quarters and keeping the compound free of feces).
 We sought to investigate whether any changes in WASH behaviors targeted by the Andilaye
 intervention were sustained, and we tracked intervention fidelity through a process evaluation.
 We employed a structured sampling strategy to randomly select 50 eligible clusters within
 our sampling frame. Fig 1 provides further details in the CONSORT flow diagram. Clusters
 were defined as rural or peri-urban sub-districts (kebeles)—the smallest government adminis-
 trative unit in Ethiopia—that were accessible throughout the course of the year. Of the
 kebeles enrolled into the study, 22 were selected from Farta, 12 from Fogera, and 16 from Bahir
 Dar Zuria. The secondary sampling unit for this study was the household; specifically, any
 household residing in a targeted, sentinel village (gott) within a randomly selected study kebele.
 
<section> We utilized a ‘fried egg’ [47] approach to purposively select one to two gotts that were either
 situated in or near the center of the kebele (if there were centric gotts) or were not adjacent to
 any other study kebele (in the event there are no centric gotts). This approach minimized spill-
 over of intervention effects and other externalities associated with the research between inter-
 vention and control clusters, especially those adjacent to each other. The number of targeted
 gotts depended only on the number of eligible households identified in gott census books.
 Following baseline data collection, a stratified random design at the woreda-level was used
 to assign an equal number of study kebeles to either the Andilaye intervention or the control
 group receiving no intervention using a computer-based random number generator. To secure
 balance across three key potential confounders (i.e., latrine coverage, washing station with
 soap coverage, and head of household education), we established a priori that the intervention
 and control mean values for these three variables, using baseline data, should be within two
 standard deviations of the overall mean [41]. The randomization process was repeated twice
 using replacement rerandomization [48] to achieve balance according to that a priori
 criterion.
 The Health Extension Services Package, and its accompanying CLTSH module delivered
 via the HEP, were being scaled throughout Ethiopia [49] and reflected the existing govern-
 ment-supported demand-side sanitation and hygiene approach. No attempt was made to mod-
 ify the roll out of this standard of care of WASH programming in any of our study kebeles.
 
<section> There were no meaningful differences in the number of previously CLTSH-triggered and
 
<section> ODF certified kebeles, between study arms (Fig 1). Baseline WASH and demographic statistics
 [41], along with the fact that 39 of 50 kebele study clusters randomly selected for inclusion in
 the Andilaye Trial had been triggered with CLTSH, and certified ODF, provided strong evi-
 dence that behavioral slippage was, indeed, an issue that needed to be addressed in Amhara
 and perhaps elsewhere in Ethiopia.

<section> “Andilaye” intervention
 
<section> The Andilaye intervention motto was “Together we can be a strong, caring, healthy commu-
 nity”. Intervention activities offered aspirational messages that emphasized the need for collec-
 tive action to make positive change in the community and used verbal persuasion to enhance 
<section> collective efficacy perceptions [50]. The Andilaye intervention focused on three WASH-related
 behavioral themes, informed by formative research: (1) sanitation, (2) personal hygiene, and
 (3) household environmental sanitation. Within these themes were 11 constituent practices
 targeted by the intervention (Table 1); these practices were identified through formative
 research as ones that could be targeted using demand-side approaches, and were seen as
 achievable, per stakeholder feedback [41].
 Intervention activities and behavior change tools were informed by our formative research
 and specifically designed to incorporate techniques that addressed behavioral factors such as
 action knowledge, perceived personal and household barriers to behavioral adoption, identifi-
 cation and planning, and behavioral control perceptions amongst others [41]. Activities
 occurred at four levels—district, community, group, and household (S1 Fig and S1 Table). Key
 activities included community mobilization and commitment events, community conversa-
 tions with influential community members through facilitated group dialog, and household
 counseling visits with caregivers—all of which were guided by behavior change tools (e.g.,
 community commitment banner, community conversations flipbook, and household counsel-
 ing flipbook and goal cards) with illustrations produced by an artist based in Ethiopia.
 The Andilaye intervention was delivered through Ethiopia’s HEP, via trained government-
 salaried Woreda Health Office officials, HEWs, and volunteer Women’s Development Army
 Leaders (WDALs) (Fig 2; see S2 Table for an alignment of relevant roles and responsibilities
 the HEP and Andilaye Trial). Implementation of the Andilaye intervention was overseen by
 Ethiopia-based study team. The Andilaye intervention commenced with district-level capacity
 building activities, such as action planning to orient key government stakeholders and training
 of trainers who would facilitate intervention activities in kebeles allocated to receive the Andi-
 laye intervention. Further, district-level refresher trainings and adaptive management activities
 were conducted to reinforce previously acquired knowledge and skills, address trainer/facilita-
 tor turnover, and review successes and address challenges faced in implementing group and
 household level activities. Community-level activities included the ‘Whole System in the
 Room’ [51], community mobilization and commitment events, and cross-fertilization visits.
 These activities intended to engage community stakeholders in action planning, create an
 enabling environment in which change may occur, and address inter-personal factors related
 to public commitment, social norms, and social support related to improved practices, among
 others. WDALs from each intervention kebele were trained on how to conduct Andilaye
 household counseling visits with caregivers from each household in her catchment area.
 WDALs are unpaid community health workers as part of the government-organized Women’s
 Development Army (WDA) strategy, which uses networks of neighboring women to increase
 the efficiency of HEWs in reaching every household, with one WDAL for every 30 households.
 During household-level counselling visits, trained WDALs provided personalized counselling
 to caregivers to equip them with the knowledge, skills, and motivation necessary to adopt and
 maintain improved WASH practices. Structured community conversations, implemented by
 trained community facilitators, provided further opportunity for group-level counselling and
 support.
 
<section> Outcomes of interest
 
<section> Survey instruments administered for our impact evaluation collected data on key outcomes
 through self-reports from respondents and other household members. Primary outcomes of
 interest included mental health and three targeted WASH behavioral themes (1) sanitation,
 personal hygiene, and (3) household environmental sanitation behaviors, consisting of 11 con-
 stituent practices (Table 1). To measures WASH outcomes, we pulled from standard WASH

 Index (WHO-5) [52] and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and non-specific emotional dis-
 tress using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) [53]. WHO-5 asks the respondent to indi-
 cate how frequently they relate to each of five statements in the previous two weeks using a
 five-point Likert scale. Higher scores are better (range: 0–25) with scores below 13 indicating
 poor well-being. The HSCL is a non-diagnostic tool that includes 25 items to assess symptoms
 of anxiety (items 1–10), depression (items 11–25) and overall emotional distress (all 25 items).
 We omitted two items from the depression set: an item on sexual desire, which was deemed
 inappropriate for unmarried women, and an item on suicide ideation, because we were unable
 to provide clinical recourse if needed. Participants indicated how much symptoms bothered
 them in the previous week (‘not at all’ [1] to ‘Extremely’ [4]). The final score for each state is
 mean of responses for each of the relevant items (range from 1 to 4). Scores of 1.75 or higher
 indicate that the condition could be present while lower scores are an indication of lower anxi-
 ety, depression, or distress.
 Secondary outcomes included 7-day and 2-day diarrhea period prevalence, measured
 through caregiver report of the index child (i.e., youngest child in the household aged one to
 nine years at baseline), sanitation insecurity, and water insecurity. For sanitation insecurity,
 we asked respondents to indicate how often (never, sometimes, often, always) they felt one of
 seven different forms of sanitation insecurity (i.e., 7 factors). Scores were means of all items
 the factor. A higher score represents higher sanitation insecurity. The factors were predesig-
 nated, and based on a validation that was done in another study [23]. Water insecurity was
 measured through the Household Water Insecurity Experiences (HWISE) scale [54]. HWISE
 includes 12 items with four response categories (never, rarely, sometimes, often/always). The
 score is the sum of responses, ranging from 0–36. A higher score indicates greater household
 water insecurity, and we considered households to be water insecure with a score of 12 or
 more, as described elsewhere [54]. Measures of collective efficacy [50] and intermediate behav-
 ioral antecedents were also collected, but are not reported here.
 
<section> Process evaluation
 
<section> We conducted a process evaluation alongside our impact evaluation to describe and analyze
 key aspects of the Andilaye’s implementation and provide insights and understanding of pro-
 gram impacts. We defined fidelity as the degree to which the intervention or program was
 delivered as intended [55]. Quantitative process data on dose delivered, participation, and
 dose received were collected through the direct observation of all district and community-level
 activities—these activities being facilitated or co-facilitated by the Ethiopia-based study team.
 Questions were incorporated into our survey instruments administered during quarterly mon-
 itoring and endline data collection to capture exposure to key Andilaye behavior change activi-
 ties by respondents from study-enrolled households in intervention kebeles. This included self-
 reported awareness of and attendance at the community mobilization and commitment event
 and community conversations, and the number of household counseling visits received from
 WDALs. Per protocol, all community members were targeted to attend the community mobi-
 lization and commitment event; routine (1–2 per month) community conversations primarily
 focused on influential community members (e.g., male heads of households, religious leaders,
 mother-in-laws) targeted in the ‘Whole System in the Room’; and caregivers were to receive 
<section> monthly household counseling visits (each visit lasting approximately 30 minutes) following
 the typical structure for the WDAL and in accordance the HEP.
 
<section> Sample size and power
 
<section> A detailed description of sample size considerations is published in the study protocol [41].
 Briefly, we powered this study on mental well-being outcomes, as measure by the HSCL [53],
 utilizing data from Ethiopia and East Africa suggesting that approximately 20–35% of rural
 women experience elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression [56, 57]. Our sample size
 determination indicated we should recruit and enroll 25 households from each of our 50 study
 kebeles, with 25 kebeles per study arm, targeting one index child per household. We increased
 our final sample size to accommodate for 20% of households being lost to follow-up. Our tar-
 get sample, therefore, included 30 households in each kebele, or 1,500 households in total (i.e.,
 
<section> 750 per study arm).
 
<section> Data collection
 
<section> Data were collected via structured household interviews and observations by trained enumera-
 tors during rounds of data collection. Surveys were collected using mobile phones equipped
 with the freely available Open Data Kit (http://opendatakit.org/). Households with at least one
 child aged one to nine years were randomly selected from the gott census book residing in the
 target gott(s) of the 50 study kebeles at baseline, and were followed for each round of data col-
 lection. Fig 2 and S1 Table provide a summary of the timeline of intervention implementation
 in relation to points of data collection for our impact evaluation. At the time of endline data
 collection, household-level activities had taken place for the past 14–15 months, group-level
 activities for the past 6–7 months, and community-level mobilization and commitment events
 were completed 13–14 months prior. Elements of the intervention were still ongoing during
 the time of our endline data collection, and we did not collect further data after the endline
 visit. Given the nature of the intervention, neither participants nor field teams were blinded
 intervention status.
 
<section> Analytical methods
 
<section> We followed a pre-analysis plan developed following baseline data collection [41]. The primary
 analysis method was an “intention-to-treat” analysis, which compares the intervention arm
 the control arm without regard to intervention fidelity or compliance. The majority of our pri-
 mary and secondary outcomes were binary variables, and for these we used log-linear binomial
 regression models and report the prevalence ratio (PR). For these binary outcomes we also
 present prevalence differences (PD), which were calculated using the post-estimation margins
 command to estimate the average marginal effects. For continuous outcomes, such as WHO-5
 and HSCL scores, we used linear regression models. All models included an intervention vari-
 able as a fixed effect, accounted for the stratified design through the inclusion of the woreda
 indicator variable [58], and incorporated generalized estimating equations with robust stan-
 dard errors to account for the clustering of observations within kebeles. For each of our pri-
 mary outcomes of interest, we assessed if there was interaction across various sub-groups,
 including exposure to previous CLTSH triggering and sex of the index child. We also assessed
 if water insecurity modified the effectiveness on hygiene behaviors. For all of these analyses,
 we included interaction terms to test if effect modification was present (i.e., the interaction
 term had a p-value <0.05).
 
<section> To assess whether any improvements in WASH behaviors were sustained between follow-
 up periods, we compared the prevalence of key targeted sanitation, hygiene, household 
<section> environmental sanitation indicators between the demand-side intervention arm and the con-
 trol arm group using the baseline, midline, and endline data (Fig 2).
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Survey results
 
<section> Our baseline assessment showed balance in terms of our primary outcomes of interest and
 demographic variables [41]. Our endline results reflect complete data from 1,472 (93%) of
 1,589 households enrolled in the study at baseline, and exceeded our sample size requirement
 of 1,250 households. Of the 793 enrolled intervention households and 796 enrolled control
 households, retention was similar in both arms, at 94% and 92%, respectively (Fig 1). A large
 majority (90%) of the respondents were female, who were typically the primary caretakers. Of
 these 1,472 respondents, 85% were the mother of the index child.
 
<section> Process evaluation
 
<section> Reports from Woreda Health Offices collected at endline indicated that none of the 50 study
 kebeles (intervention or control) received additional CLTSH triggering or re-triggering during
 the course of the Andilaye Trial. For the Andilaye intervention, the fidelity of action planning
 workshops and trainings at the district and community levels were high (See S3 Table for a
 summary of process data on dose delivered, participation, and dose received for all interven-
 tion activities). All three study woredas and their intervention kebeles (n = 25) had action plan-
 ning and management (S3a Table) and training and capacity building (S3b Table)
 intervention activities completed as planned, at the district and community levels, respectively.
 Participation was high among targeted government and community stakeholders during cata-
 lyzing and maintenance action planning and management activities (S3a Table). Nearly all of
 our targeted Woreda Health Office officials, HEWs, and WDALs were trained on Andilaye
 counseling visits with caregivers and all intervention kebeles had a pair of facilitators trained
 on Andilaye community conversations—including rounds of review meetings and refresher
 trainings (S3b Table). All intervention kebeles had a community mobilization and commit-
 ment event completed as planned, with an estimated average of around 300 adult community
 members in attendance per event (S3c Table).
 Our household process evaluation survey results reflect complete data from 703 (89%) and
 707 (89%) of 793 study-enrolled households in intervention kebeles from quarterly monitoring
 and endline data collection, respectively. Reported frequency of household-level counseling
 visits reflected a total of 665 study-enrolled households as these questions were not relevant
 42 households that were residents of WDALs who were trained to conduct Andilaye counsel-
 ling visits.
 Household respondent-reported exposure of key behavior change activities varied, but was
 generally suboptimal (Fig 3). Overall, only 18% of respondents reported attending the commu-
 nity mobilization and commitment event, and 22% reported being aware of the activity in the
 months following the event (i.e., during quarterly monitoring). At endline, 28% of respondents
 reported attending at least one community conversation, and 46% reported being aware of the
 activity. WDALs and their supervisors (i.e., HEWs) were trained to facilitate monthly counsel-
 ing visits with households in their catchment area. However, at endline, only 59% of respon-
 dents reported receiving a counseling visit and 43% reported receiving at least one follow-up
 visit during the 14-15-month implementation period. No intervention kebele had WDALs
 conducting counseling visits monthly. The average number of visits was 2–3 among respon-
 dents reporting at least one counseling visit (n = 391) (S3c Table). For households receiving
 visit, 72% of respondents reported that they set household goals or incremental improvements,

 how to plan for, cope with, and overcome barriers in accordance to the Andilaye behavior
 change tools (i.e., household counseling flipbook and goal cards) (S3c Table).
 
<section> Impacts on sanitation, personal hygiene, and household environmental
 
<section> sanitation
 
<section> The intervention did not increase latrine access. At endline, 62% of both intervention and con-
 trol households had at least one latrine (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.99; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.21)
 (Table 1). There was no difference in the prevalence of improved latrines (PR 1.13; 95% CI:
 0.81, 1.59) or in fully constructed latrines (PR 1.15; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.54). Although there were
 improvements in many latrine characteristics in the intervention arm compared to the control
 arm (e.g., presence of water available or cleansing agent near or inside the latrine for hand-
 washing, and water available for flushing or self-cleansing), the conditions (e.g., presence of
 feces on floor) of latrines in the intervention arm were often poor (S4 Table).
 The intervention did not impact defecation practices. Overall, 40% of respondents reported
 practicing open defecation during the previous two days; only 46% of respondents had defe-
 cated in any latrine during the previous two days (S4 Table). All measures of latrine utilization
 and non-utilization were similar across intervention and control arms. This includes 
<section> indicators of respondent open defecation (PR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.45), safe disposal of child
 feces (PR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.69, 1.32), and number of people from another household who used
 latrine during last seven days (difference: -0.40; 95% CI: -0.85, 0.05).
 The intervention did not impact personal hygiene behaviors. The prevalence of washing
 stations with water (PR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.26) was similar between the intervention and
 control arms. Presence of hand or face washing stations were observed in 98% of households
 (Table 1), although water and soap were observed in only 20% of handwashing stations and
 2% of facewashing stations (S4 Table). The prevalence of stations with soap was higher in the
 intervention arm, although only 3% of households in this arm had a washing station with soap
 present. Among all children aged one to nine years at endline, observations of facial cleanliness
 indicated 29% had ocular discharge, 38% had wet nasal discharge, 44% had dry nasal dis-
 charge, and 50% had dust, dirt, or debris on their faces (Table 1). There were no meaningful
 differences between the study arms for any of these facial cleanliness measures.
 We found no evidence that the Andilaye intervention impacted household environmental
 sanitation. Across both arms, the majority of respondents and heads of household had animal
 herding responsibilities (88% overall), and animal feces were present in the compound in 82%
 household compounds (S4 Table). A similar proportion of households in intervention and
 control kept animals separate from the house (PR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.91, 1.11). About half of
 households did not leave animal feces/waste in the open (Table 1); this was similar between
 the intervention and control arms (PR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.28).
 
<section> Sustained changes of key indicators. There was little difference in the sustainability of
 key targeted indicators—assessed by changes between midline and endline—on sanitation
 access and practices, personal hygiene access and practices, and household environmental san-
 itation over the course of follow up (Fig 4). At midline, most variables continued to show little
 difference between the intervention and control arms, although the prevalence of drop hole
 covers in latrines and the prevalence of appropriate hygiene behaviors were more common in
 the intervention arm. At the endline visit, the prevalence of drop hole cover was largely sus-
 tained in the intervention arm, while the prevalence of drop hole covers decreased in the con-
 trol arm (PR = 1.77’ 95% CI: 1.19, 2.63). All other variables at endline had similar prevalence
 levels when comparing the two arms. While the prevalence of hand hygiene behaviors was
 maintained at levels similar to the midline visit, increases in hand hygiene behaviors in the
 control arm narrowed the difference between the intervention and control arms at endline.
 Over the two follow-up surveys, there was an increase in the prevalence of household hand or
 facewashing stations that appeared among study arms.
 
<section> Impacts on mental health
 
<section> There was no difference between study arms in the scores for anxiety, depression, emotional
 distress or general well-being (Table 2). There was also no difference between the intervention
 and control arms in the prevalence of each mental health condition: anxiety (PR = 0.90; 95%
 
<section> CI: 0.72, 1.11), depression (PR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.07), emotional distress (PR: 0.86; 95% CI:
 0.67, 1.09) and poor well-being (PR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.10) (Table 2). All measures of mental
 health trended in the protective direction for both mean scores and prevalence (2–3% reduc-
 tion), but were not statistically different between study arms.
 
<section> Secondary health outcomes
 
<section> Reported diarrhea. Diarrhea prevalence during the last seven days among index children
 was similar in the intervention (7%) and control (6%) arms (PR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.93; 
<insert> Table 3). Among index children, there were also similarities comparing study arms in diarrhea
 prevalence when assessing episodes over the last two days (PR: 1.25; 95% CI: 0.71, 2.22).
 Water and sanitation insecurity. The intervention did not statistically reduce water inse-
 curity prevalence between intervention (5.7%) and control (8.8%) arms (PR: 0.50 (95% CI: .21,
 1.2); Table 3). At endline, sanitation insecurity scores related to social support were statistically
 lower (i.e., better) in the intervention arm than in the control arm (score difference: -0.10, 95%

 Notes.
 a We used linear regression models to estimate the difference in the outcomes comparing the intervention and control arms. Models accounted the stratified design by
 including woreda indicator variables [58], and accounted for clustering within kebeles by using generalized estimating equations with robust standard errors.
 b We asked respondents to indicate how much the symptoms bothered them in the previous week with four potential response options (not at all (1) to extremely (4)).
 The first ten symptoms assess anxiety (i.e., ‘suddenly scared for no reason’, ‘nervousness or shakiness inside’), the next 13 assess depression (i.e. ‘feeling low in energy’,
 ‘feeling hopeless about the future’), and the 23 collectively assess non-specific emotional distress. For each outcome, the score is the sum of the responses divided by the
 number of items.
 c We asked respondents about well-being, and responses ranged from ‘(0) At no time’ to (5) All of the time’. Scores were summed, and range from 0–25; the higher the
 score, the better the well-being.
 d We used similar log-linear binomial regression models to compare the prevalence of the outcomes between the intervention and control arms.
 e Prevalence differences (PD) were calculated using post-estimation commands to estimate the average marginal effects.
 Each of the above scores was dichotomized, with scores greater than 1.75 indicating a positive status for any of the three outcomes.
 g The above score was dichotomized with scores below 13 indicating poor well-being.

<section> CI: -0.16, -0.43), indicating a reduced frequency of experiencing the circumstances in the
 social support domain (e.g., trouble finding support to watch dependents during urination,
 worry about dependents when going to defecate, had to leave dependents alone to urinate,
 etc.). Other sanitation insecurity measures were similar between arms.
 
<section> Interaction and effect modification
 
<section> There was no interaction of the intervention by previous CLTSH triggering for any of the pri-
 mary outcome variables of interest. We did not detect effect measure modification by sex for
 any of the four mental health outcomes. Similarly, we did not detect interaction by child’s sex
 for any of these outcomes. We also did not detect interaction between the intervention and
 water insecurity on any of the primary handwashing or face washing variables.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> The Andilaye intervention generally did not improve WASH conditions or outcomes. Without
 sustained changes to these WASH conditions and behaviors, changes in well-being were not
 likely, and indeed, were not detected. Improving sanitation and hygiene behaviors in rural
 communities remains a considerable challenge, especially in regions with poor water access
 and high levels of WASH-related NTD endemicity. Most studies designed to change sanitation
 and hygiene behavior are efficacy studies [27]—meant to assess changes under controlled con-
 ditions; ours was an effectiveness study, designed to measure changes in a real-world context.
 We believe that poor fidelity of intervention delivery played a considerable role in uptake of

 felt some form of sanitation insecurity (never, sometimes, often, always). These items were then summed with all
 of items to create a score. The factors were predesignated, and based on a validation that was done in another
 insecurity. d We used similar linear regression models to estimate difference comparing the outcomes between
 scale with four response categories (never, rarely, sometimes, often/always), and a total summed score of those
 indicates greater household water insecurity. We considered water insecure as a score of 12 or more, as described
 
<section> the intervention, pointing to challenges in delivering demand-side sanitation and hygiene
 interventions at scale and through existing community-based models.
 We did not find statistical differences between study arms at endline and few promising
 trends in intervention communities for some of the targeted behaviors. Changes were much
 lower than with approaches found by Crocker et al. elsewhere in Ethiopia [33, 36]. Similarly,
 Apanga et al. found that implementation of the Rural Sustainable Sanitation and Hygiene for
 All (SSH4A) approach that employs a multidimensional intervention led to a large increase
 77 percentage points in sanitation coverage in Ethiopia and also coverage gains in many other
 countries under study [59], although slippage did occur after conclusion of program activities,
 whereas many other countries sustained their previous sanitation coverage gains [60].
 Our Andilaye intervention did not statistically impact validated mental health measures.
 Few studies have measured the impact of a sanitation intervention on mental health outcomes 
<section> despite calls for broader investigations of sanitation-related health impacts [14, 61, 62]. In
 rural India, women’s experiences of sanitation, as measured by a validated sanitation insecu-
 rity measure, were associated with well-being, anxiety, depression, and distress, even when
 women had access to a facility [25]. Similarly, in urban Mozambique, latrine location and
 neighborhood violence were important determinants of safety perceptions and corresponding
 psychosocial stress [63]. These findings highlight the need for interventions to consider the
 experience of sanitation beyond access to a facility alone and the intrinsic value of sanitation
 [64]. We assessed if changes to sanitation access and sanitation insecurity—changes that we
 anticipated would be generated by this intervention—would lead to improved mental health
 states, including improved well-being and reduction in symptoms associated with anxiety,
 depression, distress and general wellbeing. The intention-to-treat analysis did not detect
 changes to mental well-being scores or to sanitation insecurity scores, which was perhaps lim-
 ited by our short evaluation period, and sanitation quality (Fig 2). However, we saw some,
 non-statistically different, preventive trends across all mental health measures which were pri-
 marily among women (90% of respondents). Our impact on sanitation social support is indica-
 tive of the underlying philosophy of the Andilaye intervention, which was designed contrary
 the “shame” drivers of more traditional CLTSH [28, 65]. These findings are encouraging
 despite the low fidelity of the intervention delivery at household-level, suggesting improved
 fidelity may result in evidence of impact. We believe further studies are warranted to test the
 hypothesis that improved sanitation would impact mental well-being, as our intervention did
 not change sanitation behaviors, quality, or access.
 The purpose of this study was to develop and test an intervention that could be scaled
 within the existing Ethiopian HEP. The intervention was designed to be incorporated into pre-
 vailing programs (e.g., HEP) to demonstrate potential for scale-up, and did not succeed in this
 regard. For example, despite high attendance at trainings and action planning workshops, and
 the provision of supportive supervision and on-the-job-training tools, many households did
 not receive Andilaye counseling visits (Fig 3). WDALs and HEWs reported that they did not
 receive supportive supervision from relevant government officials in accordance with their
 action plans (S3b Table). While supportive supervision considerations were acknowledged
 and incorporated into the design of the Andilaye intervention, these requirements did not go
 above and beyond what is expected of the HEP (S2 Table) [66]. These delivery challenges are
 consistent with those associated with CLTSH programming and HEP more broadly [37, 67].
 Additionally, a majority of intervention kebeles had non-active WDALs at the start of imple-
 mentation, as identified by our Ethiopian-based study team during initial recruitment of activ-
 ity facilitators. At endline, only 66% of respondents from our process evaluation surveys were
 able to identify the WDAL responsible for conducting their Andilaye counseling visits (S3c
 Table). A cross-sectional study in four regions of Ethiopia found similar trends in varying lev-
 els of WDAL strategy implementation strength among 423 kebeles [68]. Importantly, findings
 from Damtew et al. suggest HEP outreach activities were higher in kebeles where active WDAL
 density was higher (i.e., fewer households per active WDAL). Although HEWs were paid
 health workers, WDALs were not. This has brought questions of ethics and sustainability as
 WDALs are increasingly asked to provide more and more services. Recent qualitative and
 quantitative studies suggest that unpaid WDALs are actually worse off than their peers and
 makes women, especially unmarried women, vulnerable to negative gossip and psychological
 distress [69, 70]. Although this point goes much deeper into the political economy, it is an
 important gap to bring up in the context of empowering women volunteers to enact positive
 change in their communities [71]. Further, when community health workers are paid to
 deliver the intervention, there is evidence of successful delivery [72]. Together, these findings 
<section> raise questions about the possibility of bringing new programs and approaches to the HEP
 without adequate support.
 Evidence suggests that it is important to move away from information-based interventions
 to address the array of behavioral factors and determinants that operate at various levels of
 influence [73–78]. Few sanitation and hygiene interventions employ behavioral theory to
 locally adapt messages [36, 79]. Exceptions include the SuperAmma intervention, which was
 developed and implemented in India, and found substantial gains in handwashing with soap
 [80] and studies that examined the effectiveness of the risk, attitudes, norms, abilities and self-
 regulation (RANAS) behavioral model to intervention design and showed positive impacts on
 a variety of WASH behaviors including safe water consumption, solar water disinfection,
 handwashing, and cleaning of shared sanitation [81–87]. Our intervention aimed to focus on
 variety of contextually appropriate behavioral factors rather than knowledge alone. Given the
 low fidelity of the intervention delivery, further capacity building of federal, regional, and
 local-level government officials as well as community-level change agents may be necessary
 the successful implementation of approaches that move beyond dissemination of information
 and messages [88–90].
 The WASH sector has traditionally relied on unpaid female labor (in this case HEWs,
 WDALs), which are gender exploitative approaches that reinforce women as the household
 duty bearers for WASH [91]. While our assessment of mental health highlights the potential
 impact on women beyond their roles as mothers and caregivers, our intervention strategy pro-
 vided little exception to the longstanding program strategy of adding to the already burden-
 some roles as child caregiver. Interventions that fail to assess burdens on women, and mothers
 in particular, may impose harms or burdens that can exacerbate inequalities [92]. Gender-dis-
 aggregated data on the workload of women and girls in household responsibilities [93], as well
 as better sex-disaggregated data on program outcomes could support WASH strategies that
 lead to gender transformative, and ultimately more sustainable programming [61].
 
<section> Study strengths
 
<section> Our intervention was theory-informed and included an extensive intervention design process
 during which we emphasized the solicitation and incorporation of feedback from key stake-
 holders at regional, zonal, woreda, and community-levels. It was designed to be delivered at
 scale within the Ethiopian HEP. We utilized a randomized study design, in which intervention
 and control communities were allocated to treatment arms randomly. While CRTs tend to
 emphasize internal validity, we made considerable effort to enhance external validity. Our
 study was spread over three woredas in two zones, yielding a heterogeneous mix of contexts
 and topographical conditions—which serve as a proxy for factors such as soil type, access to
 markets, and flooding risk—and support external validity of the findings. To improve interval
 validity, we used a ‘fried egg’ [47] approach—while allocation occurred at the kebele level,
 intervention activities and data collection occur in one to two sentinel gotts per kebele, purpo-
 sively selected to minimize spillover. We targeted both rural and peri-urban communities and
 collected behavioral outcome data on a variety of household members (e.g., primary female
 caregiver of index child, head of household, all children aged 0–17 years).
 
<section> Study limitations
 
<section> The study faced significant delays in gaining local ethical approval to start the project which
 led to truncated implementation and follow-up periods. Key government actors were less
 involved than planned, which may have led to sub-optimal fidelity. The integration of Andilaye
 intervention activities into non-Ethiopian HEP delivery structures (e.g., hired independent 
<section> community implementers) may yield further investigations into the effectiveness of the inter-
 vention on sustained behavior change and mental well-being. Several of our behavioral out-
 comes were reported (vs. observed), and these types of outcomes may be prone to reporting
 biases, indicated by differences in our reported and observed measures.
 
<section> Conclusions
 
<section> We did not find that the Andilaye intervention yielded changes in behaviors and conditions
 related to sanitation, personal hygiene, or household environmental sanitation; nor did it
 impact mental health outcomes. Limited integration of Andilaye activities into the HEP likely
 explains the minimal impact observed and points to considerable challenges related to imple-
 menting demand-side interventions at scale in Ethiopia. There is a crucial need to identify and
 scale effective service delivery models in order to meet the ambitious Sustainable Development
 Goal targets for sanitation and hygiene [94]. Evidence from this trial may help address knowl-
 edge gaps related to scalable alternatives to CLTSH and inform sanitation and hygiene pro-
 gramming and policy in Ethiopia and beyond. A greater emphasis on implementation
 research in WASH delivery would support tools and approaches for developing, testing, and
 adapting scalable best-practice interventions [95].
