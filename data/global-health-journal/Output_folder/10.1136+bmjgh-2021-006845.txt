<section> ABSTRACT
 
<section> Background Extreme heat exposure is a growing public
 health concern. In this trial, we tested the impact of a
 community health worker (CHW) led heat education
 programme on all-­cause mortality, unplanned hospital
 visits and changes in knowledge and practices in Karachi,
 Pakistan.
 
<section> Methods The Heat Emergency Awareness and Treatment
 trial was a community-­based, open-­label, two-­group,
 unblinded cluster-­randomised controlled trial that
 implemented a CHW-­led educational intervention between
 March and May 2018 in Karachi, Pakistan. We randomly
 assigned (1:1) 16 clusters, each with ~185 households
 or 1000 population, to the intervention or usual care
 (control group). We collected data on all-­cause mortality,
 unplanned hospital visits, evidence of heat illness through
 surveillance and a knowledge and practice survey during
 the summer months of 2017 (preintervention) and 2018
 (postintervention).
 
<section> Findings We recruited 18 554 participants from 2991
 households (9877 individuals (1593 households) in the
 control group and 8668 individuals (1398 households)
 in the intervention group). After controlling for temporal
 trends, there was a 38% (adjusted OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49
 to 0.77) reduction in hospital visits for any cause in the
 intervention group compared with the control group. In
 addition, there was an improvement in many areas of
 knowledge and practices, but there was no significant
 difference in all-­cause mortality.
 
<section> Interpretation A CHW-­led community intervention was
 associated with decreased unscheduled hospital visits,
 improved heat literacy and practices but did not impact
 all-­cause mortality. CHWs could play an essential role in
 preparing communities for extreme heat events.

<section> Key questions
 
<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► Most studies studying the effectiveness of
 community-­ based interventions to target heat-­
 related illnesses are limited to high-­income coun-
 tries that have developed public health management
 strategies to respond to heatwaves. However, these
 studies do not show conclusive evidence to highlight
 the effectiveness of these approaches. There is a lag
 in planning and response to heat-­related illnesses in
 low-­income settings across countries, and the little
 evidence on population-­based estimates was limited
 to observational studies.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► This study designed and tested a heat emergency
 awareness and treatment (HEAT) intervention, devel-
 oped using current evidence and relevance to low-­
 resource settings. The HEAT intervention comprises
 customised health messages coupled with infor-
 mation, education and communication materials to
 optimise the delivery of those messages, especially
 for communities with limited access to resourc-
 es such as water, electricity and air-­conditioning.
 There was a 38% reduction in the primary outcome
 of unscheduled hospital visits for any illness in the
 postintervention phase. In addition, there was an im-
 provement in knowledge of the symptoms, risk fac-
 tors and emergency interventions required to save
 the lives of victims with heatstroke. Also, the study
 showed that an educational intervention through
 community health workers could impact morbidity in
 poor, urban communities. Longer-­term studies will
 be needed to confirm our findings.
 
<section> What do the new findings imply?
 
<section> ► A community-­based approach to address the heat
 mortality and morbidity among the most vulnerable
 could help communities better prepare for heat-
 waves and potentially reduce the heat-­related bur-
 den of death and disability in low-­income settings. 
<section> change, extreme heat exposure is a rapidly evolving
 global public health issue. 1 During the past 20 years, there
 has been a 50% increase in heat-­related mortality among
 adults 65 and older. 3 In 2018 alone, 296 000 people died
 due to extreme heat exposure globally. 1 Extreme heat
 exposure leads to morbidity and mortality through direct
 temperature dysregulation causing heat exhaustion and
 heat stroke though most of the health impact is through
 exacerbation of illnesses such as diabetes and hyperten-
 sion resulting in a higher incidence of acute illnesses
 such as myocardial infarction and stroke. 4 The economic
 cost of extreme heat on a global level is estimated to
 be 302 billion work hours lost in 2019. 5 Evidence from
 primarily high-­income cities show that systematic policy
 level changes to reduce exposure to extreme heat can
 improve overall mortality and morbidity. 6
 City dwellers are at a significantly greater risk for
 extreme heat exposure. Due to the urban heat island
 effect, cities have a 3.5°C–12°C higher temperature than
 surrounding areas. 8 9 Over the years, cities in many high-­
 income countries and a few low-­ income and middle-­
 income countries (LMICs) have developed ‘heat action
 plans’ comprising citywide interventions to reduce heat
 exposure for those most at risk. 7 10 11 A recent system-
 atic review on the impact of heat adaptation strategies
 on heat-­related mortality and morbidity reported that
 90% of published research emanated from high-­income
 countries. 12 These limitations highlight the growing need
 to develop and test strategies to adapt and protect the
 most vulnerable in low-­income settings from the negative
 impacts of heat. 13
 Within communities, neighbourhoods and indi-
 vidual households have varying levels of vulnerability to
 extreme heat and require targeted interventions based
 on household-­level risk. 15 Community-­based, household-­
 level heat interventions targeting the most vulnerable
 urban communities have not been tested in LMICs
 through a controlled trial. Additionally, little data exists
 on the role of community health workers (CHWs), a crit-
 ical frontline workforce in many settings in preparing
 communities for heatwaves.
 We hypothesised that in populations with extremely
 limited resources, a contextually relevant, simple, educa-
 tional intervention aimed at reducing heat exposure and
 facilitating early treatment, delivered through CHWs,
 can result in improved knowledge and practices as well
 as a decrease in the incidence of all-­cause deaths and
 hospitalisations. We called the educational intervention
 the Heat Emergency Awareness and Treatment (HEAT)
 intervention.
 
<section> METHODS
 Study design and participants
 The HEAT trial was an open-­label, prospective, two-­armed,
 unblinded, cluster-­ randomised, community-­ based trial
 conducted in Ibrahim Hyderi, located in Korangi District
 of the northern part of Karachi, Pakistan. Ibrahim Hyderi
 is one of the oldest areas of Karachi and is home to many
 different communities representing various cultural
 and language groups. These ethnic groups included
 Sindhis, Katchis, Bengalis, Pakhtuns, Balochis, Muhajirs
 and Hazara and differed in the language, dietary habits,
 education level, income level, mobility and predominant
 occupation.
 The Aman Foundation, our local partner, has had a pre-­
 existing CHW programme in Ibrahim Hyderi, providing
 services to improve maternal and child health through
 screening and treatment of non-­communicable diseases
 to about 100 000 people in the area. The Aman CHW
 programme was supported by a telehealth programme
 to disseminate health messages and provide a telephone-­
 based 24/7 health helpline. The pre-­ existing CHW
 programme had divided the area into 30 neighbour-
 hoods (or ‘paras’) consisting of relatively homogenous
 ethnic populations of about 3000 each, served by one
 CHW, usually a female resident of the same community.
 The health services available to the Ibrahim Hyderi
 community included the Ibrahim Hyderi Sindh Govern-
 ment Hospital (IHSGH) and many private and charity
 clinics. The IHSGH was primarily used for outpatient
 clinics and some basic inpatient care. For emergency
 care, the population generally used either a charity
 hospital about 5 km away or a larger government hospital
 about 13 km away.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 We followed a two-­ step sampling strategy. First, we
 randomly selected sixteen paras from 30 through a
 random draw. To determine which of the paras were cases
 and controls, we then stratified the paras by ethnicity, and
 half of the paras from each ethnic group were assigned
 to either the intervention or control arms using the
 second random draw. The second draw was carried out
 to minimise confounding caused by an unequal distribu-
 tion of ethnic groups. The randomisation sequence was
 not concealed or blinded. Data collectors were unaware
 of the intervention and control distribution during the
 preintervention phase. All paras and households in
 Ibrahim Hyderi were eligible to be enrolled in the study.
 We selected study households using the existing maps
 of clusters located in the centre of each cluster, starting
 approximately in the centre of para and enrolling houses
 clustered around the centre. If a family refused to partic-
 ipate in the study, we enrolled the adjoining house until
 we reached a sample size of approximately 1200 persons
 per cluster. There were no provisions for interim data
 analysis, and there were no guidelines for early stopping
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> To calculate the sample size, we assumed that the all-­cause
 death rate of Korangi district was the same as for Pakistan,
 that is, 7 per 1000 population. 16 To achieve 80% power
 to detect a difference between the group proportions
 of 20% in the primary outcome of all-­cause death from
 the baseline at a significance level of 0.05, a minimum of 
<section> 7120 people were required in each group, that is, at least
 890 subjects in each of the 16 clusters. To account for
 lost to follow-­up, we planned to enrol 1200 individuals
 per cluster (approximately 170 households) for a total
 of 19 200 individuals. We excluded all other households
 from each para once the sample size was reached.
 
<section> The intervention
 The HEAT intervention comprises customised and
 contextual health messages for (1) the prevention of
 and (2) early recognition of heat-­related illnesses. We
 developed the intervention through a multistep, itera-
 tive process in collaboration with the Aman Foundation.
 First, we reviewed the literature on community-­ based
 interventions for heat illnesses from India, Pakistan, the
 USA, the UK, and those published by WHO. 4–6 11 17–19 We
 have published the literature review results elsewhere.
 Based on the literature, the Aman Community Health
 Programme team and investigator jointly drafted health
 messages which were reviewed by ten public health and
 emergency care experts, four from the USA, one from
 India and five from Pakistan. We conducted two meet-
 ings with international experts (one in-­person) and three
 meetings with local experts in Pakistan (all in-­person) to
 review and finalise the draft messages. The six members
 of the International Advisory Group represented exper-
 tise in heat emergencies, public health, environmental
 sciences, and earth and planetary sciences. There were
 five members of the National Advisory Group consisting
 of a professor of civil engineering department from a
 local engineering university, a representative of an envi-
 ronmental health advocacy group, head of the largest
 emergency department in the city, director of the provin-
 cial meteorology department and a journalist interested
 in environment and health. After the initial review by the
 International and National Advisory groups, we asked six
 community health nurses (CHNs) working in Ibrahim
 Hyderi to review and provide feedback regarding the local
 applicability and acceptability of the key messages. We
 conducted three focus group discussions and six in-­depth
 interviews with community members, CHWs, and health-
 care providers to further inform our intervention. 21 The
 messages were translated into Urdu and Sindhi by the
 local team from Aman Foundation. The intervention was
 pilot tested in a non-­study community of Ibrahim Hyderi.
 The feedback was to simplify the messaging further, using
 concrete examples during the sessions and removing the
 use of air conditioners and excessive use of bathing as
 an intervention due to electric and water scarcity in the
 community.
 The final HEAT intervention included key messaging
 on risk factors, symptoms associated with heat-­ related
 illnesses, individual and household level preventative
 measures, dietary modification, early recognition of heat
 illness and steps to manage patients with possible heat
 illness. (See attached brochure in online supplemental
 material). Some of the key messages used in the commu-
 nications were (1) wearing lightweight, light-­coloured,
 loosely fitted clothes; (2) carrying a bottle of cold water
 with you when you are out and about; (3) staying indoors
 and, if possible, in a well-­ventilated place; (4) wearing a
 hat or if possible or using an umbrella for shade and (5)
 limiting outdoor activities to morning and evening hours
 during extreme heat (online supplemental appendices
 
<section> 1 and 2).
 The intervention was delivered by a team of ten CHWs,
 two community health supervisors (CHS), and two
 CHNs. The team worked full time for the Aman Foun-
 dation and did not receive any additional incentive or
 remuneration besides their regular salary from the Foun-
 dation. The investigators trained the CHWs, CHS, and
 CHNs through a 2-­day workshop lasting approximately
 12 hours. Topics covered included an introduction to
 climate change, the global trend of heatwaves, individual-­
 based and community-­based risk factors for heat illnesses,
 the diagnosis and management of heat illnesses at the
 community and household level. Additionally, sessions
 were held to demonstrate communication best practices,
 and mock sessions were held for the household visit and
 community meetings. The study team evaluated CHWs’
 understanding of the content and their ability to commu-
 nicate and answer any questions through a series of mock
 scenarios. The study leadership held weekly sessions for
 the implementation team during the intervention period
 to answer any questions as the intervention was rolled out.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> We carried out HEAT intervention in March and April
 of 2018 and divided it into two main activities, individual
 household visits and neighbourhood meetings. During
 the individual household visits, the CHWs used the
 HEAT pamphlets and posters to discuss the risk factors,
 symptoms, preventive measures, including dietary modi-
 fications, recognition and early management of potential
 health illnesses. Each session lasted about 20–25 min and
 was attended by everyone available at home at the time
 of the visit. CHWs answered any questions, discussed
 potential barriers and solutions. During the 8 weeks of
 intervention, each CHW visited each household in the
 intervention clusters four times for a total of 5420 house-
 hold visits. On average, each CHW visited 13 household
 visits per day.
 Additionally, CHWs conducted 80 neighbourhood
 meetings to engage those not traditionally at home. The
 sessions followed a pattern similar to the household visits
 but lasted longer and were generally more interactive.
 A total of 80 such sessions were conducted and were
 attended by a total of 1628 individuals. We did not track
 how many people attended more than one such session.
 At the end of both sessions, community members were
 given pamphlets printed in Urdu and Sindhi languages
 summarising the discussion (online supplemental appen-
 dices 1 and 2).

 collection strategy (described below) but did not receive
 the heat intervention. However, after the postinterven-
 tion data collection was completed, the control clusters
 received the same intervention.
 
<section> Data collection
 Table 1 summarises the intervention and control commu-
 nities’ study phases and field activities.
 To measure deaths and illnesses requiring hospital
 visits and monitor symptoms of heat illness, we estab-
 lished a community-­ based surveillance system during
 the three warmest months in Karachi (May, June, July
 in 2017 and 2018). Trained data collectors visited each
 study household in the intervention and control cluster
 every other week for a total of five visits per household.
 The data collectors were from the same community, were
 employed by Aman Foundation for other health and
 research-­related activities, and were trained in the data
 collection by the study team. Data was collected through
 a structured questionnaire, which was peer-­reviewed and
 pretested before final implementation. All data were
 collected electronically using android tablets. During
 the first visit, the data collectors obtained detailed demo-
 graphic and health information on each family member
 and information about the size of the house, building
 material, including the material used in the roof, avail-
 ability of water, electricity, air-­conditioning, water cooler,
 refrigerator and electricity generator. Most homes in
 Ibrahim Hyderi were built on an 80 sq. yard (<720 square
 feet) plot of land. The size of the home reflected the
 socioeconomic status and the crowding in the house and
 was therefore included as an independent variable.
 Similarly, in Karachi, houses or apartments facing west
 or having windows westward, locally called ‘west open,’
 are considered desirable due to the cooling effect of the
 eastward breeze. We, therefore, included ‘west open’
 as an independent variable. Similarly, houses without
 windows were also identified and included in the anal-
 ysis. We asked about the water source but did not ask if
 the water was potable.
 In the subsequent four visits, the data collectors
 obtained information on any illness, including signs,
 symptoms, exposure to heat and whether hospital-­based
 care was sought during the past 2 weeks. In case of death,
 the cause of death was obtained from the head of the
 household. To assess knowledge, attitude and practices
 (KAP), we surveyed each household in the control and
 intervention cluster and interviewed the head of the
 household. In households where men worked as fish-
 ermen and were not present at the time of the survey,
 the female head of the household was interviewed. This
 survey was conducted in Jan and February of 2018, before
 the intervention, and in September and October of 2018,
 after the postintervention data collection (table 1).
 The questionnaire for the KAP survey was developed
 by the research team based on the literature review and
 feedback from the international and national advisory
 groups. No prior example of heat KAP survey was avail-
 able from our literature review. The questionnaire was
 peer-­reviewed by the International and National Advisory
 Committees and was pretested on 12 individuals from
 clusters that were not part of the study. Formal validation
 of the KAP questionnaire was not conducted. The KAP
 survey was an android-­based questionnaire with 117 ques-
 tions, of which 71 were knowledge questions, 41 were
 practice questions and 5 were attitude questions (online
 supplemental appendix 3). 
<insert> Figure 1 Study design and sample size. 
<iend>

 For community surveillance and KAP data, several
 data quality checks were included in the e-­questionnaire,
 minimising the chances of entering incorrect or irrele-
 vant data and maximising data integrity. Data underwent
 two verification levels, and the data management team
 cleaned the data and ensured its completion. 22 First, field
 supervisors checked all the data to ensure their comple-
 tion and accuracy. Second, the data management team
 cleaned the data, identified any missing information and
 ensured that the data on the household matched with
 the Global Positioning System (GPS) location obtained
 automatically at the time of data collection.
 For May, June and July in 2017 and 2018, the team
 maintained a log of publicly available average, maximum
 and minimum temperature provided on the Pakistan
 Meteorological Department website.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The study’s primary outcomes were a composite of all-­
 cause mortality and all-­cause emergency hospital visits.
 Many studies on heat interventions have used all-­cause
 mortality and hospital visits as outcomes. 6 24–26 Since
 our focus was on severe illnesses requiring visits to the
 hospital emergency departments, we excluded visits to an
 outpatient clinic or a primary care physician
 The study’s secondary outcomes were any change in
 KAP towards heat-­related illnesses within the commu-
 nity. Only those messages that were part of the HEAT
 intervention were included in the analysis. A more
 specific measure of heat illness, such as the presence of
 heat stroke or heat exhaustion, was not included as the
 outcome measure because of the non-­specific nature of
 symptoms and lack of reasonable certainty in making
 these diagnoses at a population level based on available
 information.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 All data were analysed using STATA V.15.1 quantita-
 tive statistical software. 27 Descriptive statistical analyses
 reflected the distribution of socio-­demographic charac-
 teristics of the sample population on the household level
 across control and intervention groups in the form of
 counts and proportions. Mortality rates were calculated
 for the 3 months of the data collection and annualised
 by multiplying with a factor of 4. χ 2 tests were applied
 to test the association between pre-­and post-­intervention
 outcomes for all-­cause mortality, admission to a health-
 care facility due to an illness, and presence of any symp-
 toms of heat-­related illnesses.

<iend>

 The data on knowledge, preventive measures and
 actions during an emergency based on the key messages
 from the intervention were retrieved from the more
 extensive KAP data. Change in the proportion of house-
 hold representatives who responded ‘yes’ to a variable
 between the control and intervention groups preinter-
 vention and postintervention was calculated to represent
 secondary outcomes. Adjusted OR (aOR), accounting for
 the change in positive responses in the postintervention
 period for the intervention group compared with the
 change in responses in the preintervention group for the
 control group, were calculated to measure differences in
 primary and secondary outcomes between the interven-
 tion and the control groups.
 We developed a logistic regression model to test for
 association between the rates of an unscheduled hospital
 visit and several household indicators such as the size of
 family, size education of the head of household, water
 source, electricity and television and building material
 used in the house and the roof. 28 An interaction term
 for the group (control/intervention) and time (prein-
 tervention/postintervention) was also included in the
 regression to test whether the change seen across each
 outcome variable was actually due to the intervention.
 Written consent was obtained from the heads of each
 household for the households to be included in the
 study. We used verbal consent where participants were
 unable to read and write. The consent process occurred
 at the household level, and the Aman foundation’s
 research team was responsible for the consent process.
 The consent process occurred before the community
 surveillance began within the community.
 
<section> Public involvement
 We organised community meetings to discuss the project
 before launching it. CHWs were from the Ibrahim
 Hyderi community and were involved in the design of
 the intervention and the study’s conduct as data collec-
 tors. Community members were not directly involved
 in the study design, recruitment or conduct of the
 study. We conducted multiple session with the commu-
 nity members in Karachi to inform them of the results.
 A HEAT policy document was developed as part of the
 study and disseminated to the city government and a
 dissemination seminar was also organised in the federal
 capital of Islamabad. There was no burden of interven-
 tion on the study participants or larger community.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> We enrolled 18 544 individuals from 2991 households
 from the sixteen clusters (figure 1). Of these, 1593
 households (9877 people) were from the control clus-
 ters, and 1398 (8668 people) were from the interven-
 tion clusters. Just over half (52.69%) of the population
 were males, 87% were below 45 years, while only 1.5%
 of the population was over the age of 65 years (table 2).
 More than three-­fourth (76.13%) of the population had
 no education, and the distribution was similar for heads
 of households (77.4%). About half of the households
 had an income of less than US$2 per day (US dollar to
 Pakistani Rupees currency exchange rate of June 2018).
 Twenty per ent of households had a non-­concrete roof
 type, and about half had potable water inside their homes
 (54%). Electric power was available to 89% of the house-
 holds. Overall, the intervention and control populations
 were similar except for the proportion with an income
 level of <US$2 per day (56.6 vs 45.3, p<0.00) and the
 percentage of homes with a non-­concrete roof (65.5%
 and 34.4%, p<0.00). Less than 1% of households refused
 to participate in the study.
 
<section> Health outcomes
 Complete follow-­up data were available for 2251 (75.25%
 of the initial sample) households, of which 1194 were
 from the control group (74.5% of the initial sample) and
 1057 (75.6% of the initial sample) from the intervention
 group. In the preintervention phase, the annualised rate
 of all-­cause mortality in the intervention group was 11.72
 deaths per 1000 population (2.92 per 1000 population
 over the 3 months), while in the control group, it was
 9.18 per 1000 population (2.29 per 1000 population over
 the 3 months). In the postintervention phase, the annu-
 alised all-­cause mortality rate in the intervention group
 decreased to 11.2 per 1000 population (2.80 per 1000 over
 the 3 months), while in the control group, it increased
 to 9.88 per 1000 population (2.47 per 1000 population
 over 3 months). The adjusted odds of death in the inter-
 vention group decreased following the intervention (OR

<section> 0.86 95% CI 0.34 to 2.19) though the reduction was not
 statistically significant.
 For an illness requiring an unscheduled visit to a
 hospital, we found an overall increase in the frequency
 of hospital visits during the post-­ intervention phase
 (n=542, 3.72% vs n=688, 5.48%; p<0.001) in both control
 and intervention groups. The AOR for hospital visits in
 the intervention group was 0.62 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.77)
 (table 3).
 The logistic regression model results for the associ-
 ation between the unscheduled visit to a hospital and
 various demographic and household variables showed
 that except for a family size of more than six members,
 there was no statistically significant difference between
 the groups (table 4). There was no association between
 the education level, house size, type of roof, water avail-
 ability, electricity and ownership of a television, and risk
 of an unscheduled hospital visit.
 
<section> Knowledge and practice outcomes
 In our preinterventionand postintervention KAP survey,
 we found an improvement in the knowledge and prac-
 tices in both control and intervention groups. However,
 for the most critical messages delivered during the inter-
 vention, we found greater improvement in knowledge
 and practices among the intervention group than the
 control. For example, households in the intervention
 arm in the post-­intervention phase were 2.37 times more
 likely to be aware of high temperature as a symptom of
 heat illness than those in the control group in the pre-­
 intervention phase. Similarly, there was higher recogni-
 tion of symptoms such as weakness (OR: 1.72) and tach-
 ycardia (OR: 1.31) as symptoms of heat illness. Taking a
 shower to reduce body temperature (OR: 0.68); changing
 lifestyle such as avoiding going outside in the afternoon
 (OR: 2.78)) and modifying time to cook (1.94) were also
 more acceptable in the postintervention phase in the
 intervention group (table 5).
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> We found that a CHW-­ led, community-­ based educa-
 tional intervention was associated with no reduction in
 mortality and a 38% relative reduction in unscheduled
 hospital visits in the intervention group compared with
 the control group when adjusted for the differences at
 baseline. We also found an improvement in the commu-
 nity’s ability to recall many of the signs and symptoms of
 heat exhaustion and heatstroke, identify risk and preven-
 tive strategies, and recall steps to ensure life-­saving emer-
 gency care. However, these results have to be considered
 in the context that, despite the randomisation, interven-
 tion and control populations had different baseline rates
 of mortality and hospital visits, and in the postinterven-
 tion period, there was an overall increase in hospital visits
 not explained by temperature differences between the
 two time periods.
 Our study population likely represents some of the
 most climate-­ vulnerable population groups worldwide
 and highlights the challenges of developing and imple-
 menting potential extreme heat interventions in popu-
 lations with limited infrastructure. The most frequently
 recommended heat mitigating interventions require
 water and electric power. However, these utilities were

 not consistently available in many households in our
 study site. The concept of vulnerability to extreme heat
 needs to evolve with an improved understanding of the
 epidemiology of heat illnesses and their physiological,
 social, and environmental determinants. 24 29 We believe
 traditional measures of heat exposure and risks, such
 as temperature, humidity, and age, may overlook other,
 more complex household-­level social and economic risks
 such as the affordability and availability of water and elec-
 tricity, number of people per household, the design of the
 housing unit and access to emergency healthcare. 15 30
 Similarly, age >65 is the focus of most interventions that
 may not have the same impact in our study population,
 where only 1.5% of the total population was in that age
 group.
 There is growing evidence supporting government-­run,
 regional interventions for reducing the health impact of
 extreme heat. 20 32 33 Analysis of the heat action plans from
 multiple European cities showed a significant decrease
 in deaths during heatwaves and improved communi-
 ties’ KAP. 34–36 Further, targeted interventions focusing
 on high-­risk groups such as the elderly and those with
 known chronic medical conditions through door-­to-­door
 checks, focused health messaging and close follow-­up with
 primary physicians have also shown a significant reduc-
 tion in mortality rates. 37 38 In Ahmedabad, India, the city-
 wide implementation of a heat warning system coupled
 with a widespread communication effort led to a decrease
 in the number of heat-­related deaths reported to the
 hospital. 39 A quasi-­experimental study from Chongqing,
 China, tested a broader set of interventions, including a
 heat-­specific healthcare network, early warning system
 and preparation, a 24-­hour health helpline and doctors'
 training on heat illnesses. The study found a significant
 improvement in the incidence of heat-­related illnesses
 in the subset of rural populations measured through two
 surveys 1 year apart. 40 In another community-­based study
 set in Jinan City, China, the elderly in two urban and two
 rural settings were randomised to receive government-­
 sanctioned subsidies during high-­ temperature periods
 to keep workers home and flexible scheduling versus no
 intervention. 41 The study found improved KAP scores in
 the intervention group.
 Our study, however, focused on enhancing the commu-
 nity’s response through existing community resources,
 independent of government-­ sanctioned reliefs and
 interventions. Thus, we attempted to replicate circum-
 stances that exist in many similar LMIC cities where
 local governments, often strapped for resources, have
 limited ability to enforce heat intervention plans. Yet, we
 believe that a government-­run, heat-­health action plan
 would likely have a much more significant impact, be
 more cost-­effective and sustainable, and potentially, have
 synergistic effects when combined with community-­based
 household-­level interventions.
 Our findings have several implications for future
 preparedness for extreme heat exposures. We demon-
 strated that CHWs could provide necessary community
 education leading to a potential change in behaviour
 and health outcomes. CHWs are recognised as critical
 to many health systems, especially those in LMICs, and
 are beginning to be recognised as agents of change for
 planetary health. 42 The study served as a proxy to suggest
 that with some additional training in heat prevention,
 CHWs can create behaviour change within communities
 to reduce heat exposure and blunt the effects of extreme
 heat while other system-­ wide, resource-­ intensive inter-
 ventions are implemented. 
<section> Our study has several limitations. First, like most heat
 intervention studies, we focused on all-­cause morbidity
 and mortality as the primary outcome instead of specific
 heat-­related mortality and morbidity. This was due to
 the difficulty in diagnosing heat illnesses in commu-
 nities, especially where febrile infectious illnesses are
 common. 43–45 Second, our study did not collect informa-
 tion on the prevalence of non-­communicable diseases
 such as diabetes or hypertension for the population. We
 only collected that information once someone the in
 community reported the symptoms of heat illness. Third,
 across assumed equal distribution of individual level
 exposure to heat, and we did not measure changes in the
 exposure between the 2 years. Personal heat exposure
 data collection has been conducted in athletes and mili-
 tary personnel but less in civilian settings. 5 46 We believe,
 measuring individual-­level exposure to heat stress would
 help standardise the exposure and is possible with the
 available technology. 47 Fourth, while encouraging, our
 results are based on only two-­point estimates and do not
 prove with certainty the cause-­ and-­ effect relationship.
 Further, our intervention lasted only 1 year, making it
 difficult to study the effects of confounders between the
 2 years. For example, average maximum temperatures
 during preintervention months were slightly higher than
 post-­ intervention, while minimum temperatures were
 the same (35.2 and 28.2 in the preintervention phase vs
 36.0 and 28.2 'C in the postintervention phase). 48 Simi-
 larly, in the postintervention period, the city of Karachi
 had a significant epidemic of chikungunya infection. It is
 not clear how this affected our study area. 43 Finally, it is
 also important to recognise that the KAP questionnaire
 was designed specifically for the local context and needs
 validation in other settings.
 
<section> CONCLUSION
 Our study identified a potentially promising role for
 CHWs in improving the resilience of highly vulnerable
 low-­income urban communities against extreme heat. If
 proven through longer-­term studies in multiple settings,
 the HEAT intervention developed through this study
 could lead to significant public health benefits for the
 most vulnerable populations globally.
