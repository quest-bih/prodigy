<section> INTRODUCTION
 Globally it has been estimated that there were
 5.2 million under-­ 5 years childhood deaths
 in 2019 1 of which 20% occurred in India.
 In India in 2004, the mortality rates/1000
 live births were U5MR (number of deaths 
<section> in children aged 0–5 years/1000 live births): 76, 1 IMR
 (number of deaths of infants aged under 1 year/1000
 live births): 1 and NMR (number of neonatal deaths
 aged 0–28 days/1000 live births): 38.8 2 and NMR in
 2001 was 37.9. 3 In contrast the IMR for industrialised
 countries was 5.0 in 2005. 4 Infant mortality remains an
 important measure of social well-­being. While diarrhoea,
 pneumonia, malaria and under nutrition are common
 preventable causes of post-­neonatal deaths in rural India,
 the major reason for these high rates are persistent diffi-
 culties in access to treatment and in navigation of the
 referral pathways. 1 5 Even after accessing health facilities,
 the quality of care in most rural areas in low-­income and
 middle-­income countries (LMICs) is poor. 6 Despite the
 development of the WHO guidelines for care at first level
 facilities and hospitals, 7 most countries in LMICs, do not
 have well-­ functioning health systems that reach rural
 areas where mortality is highest. 8 The cost of even outpa-
 tient care can push marginalised families into poverty,
 since ‘free care’ is rarely available. 9 Health facilities alone
 are ineffective at averting a large proportion of child-
 hood deaths in rural areas. 10 Quality neonatal care is not
 available to most neonates in LMICs because hospitals
 are inaccessible and costly. 11 A combination of commu-
 nity outreach and health system strengthening would be
 necessary to reduce child deaths in rural India.
 Though the Indian U5MR and NMR have declined
 between 2000 and 2015 (U5MR=46.6, NMR=27), 13 there
 are remarkable disparities between rural and urban
 areas, between poorer and richer districts. 14 We found
 that IMR in India reduced from around 80 to 34 per
 1000 live births at the national level from 1990 to 2016.
 In 2004, just prior to start of the study, the rural popu-
 lation in India constituted 71.1% of Indian population
 and the U5MR varied between 8 and 131.5, while NMR
 varied between 3.8 and 84, in New Delhi and Odisha
 (tribal dominated state), respectively. 16 HBNC interven-
 tions have been shown to prevent 30%–60% of newborn
 deaths in high-­mortality settings, 17 and the WHO recom-
 mends community-­based preventive and curative care for
 high risk and poor populations by CHWs supported by
 the health system with focused training. 18
 We present results of a 15 years HBCC study in a rural
 area of India that started as a cluster randomised control
 trial (cRCT) (2004–2010), had a service phase (2011–
 2015) and a replication phase (2016–2019).
 
<section> METHODS
 Study design and participants
 We conducted a community based, cRCT of HBCC, in
 rural Melghat, Maharashtra, India. Since interventions
 were administered by VHWs at the village level, a village was
 defined as a cluster unit to minimise treatment contamina-
 tion between intervention and control groups.
 The study area, Melghat is spread over 4000 km , in
 villages, with a population of 280 000. A baseline survey
 revealed widespread faulty child-­rearing practices, large
 family sizes, treatment by traditional faith healers and low
 health-­seeking behaviour. 21 The government healthcare
 system consists of: (a) subcentre staffed with one para-
 medical worker per 4–5 villages, (b) a primary health
 centre (PHC) for 30 villages manned by a physician.
 (The physician to population ratio was >1:10 000). The
 average distance of PHCs from villages was 19 km. Every
 village participated in the Integrated Child Develop-
 ment Scheme (ICDS) providing food supplementation,
 immunisation, deworming and oral rehydration solution
 (ORS) to all under-­fives.
 
<section> Hypothesis
 
<section> Cluster-­level objectives were to reduce the U5MR and
 IMR from 147.21 to 106.60/1000 live births, respectively,
 by at least 35% in the usual resident population of 14
 in 16 villages of Melghat over 5 years.
 
<section> Patient and public involvement
 Aim of patient and public involvement in the study
 Our survey-­ based analysis (year 2002–2003) of very high
 U5MR in Melghat revealed that the existing policies, health-
 care system and government interventions were malaligned
 to the community’s needs and socio-­ cultural practices,
 resulting in low healthcare seeking behaviour. A survey was
 done to understand the underlying causes of the very high
 U5MR in Melghat. Hence, we included community partici-
 pation and patient and public involvement (PPI) as a critical
 part of the intervention to reduce U5MR and IMR.
 
<section> Description of the methods used for PPI
 The public was first involved through gramsabha/
 community meetings with >60% of adults in the villages
 in attendance. We obtained informed written consent
 from the community members present at these meetings,
 that were designed to explain the aims and methods to
 be used in the research study. The principal investigator
 and the study team conducted these meetings to under-
 stand the community’s needs, their demand for health
 services, as well as acceptable and approachable methods
 for service delivery. Our team conducted door-­to-­door
 surveys to understand the health problems, priorities,
 along with the most important and common causes
 of deaths. After this, we discovered that the commu-
 nity wanted easily accessible, free, culturally acceptable
 services from a person who knew the local language
 and traditions and who respected the community and
 understood its problems. They identified HBCC as the
 most urgent need. Thus the experience, preferences and
 health needs of community members were used to design
 the methodology of the study. We worked in close associ-
 ation with the traditional health system (ie, birth attend-
 ants, community leaders and traditional faith healers).
 We conducted all our interventions in the community in
 accordance with their requests, respecting their culture,
 traditional practices, language and socioeconomic condi-
 tions. The women showed reluctance for hospital-­based
 delivery and newborn care. They preferred delivery by 
<section> traditional birth attendants (TBAs). Hence, the HBCC
 programme was implemented by trained tribal, socially
 sensitive, female VHWs who provided culturally accept-
 able good quality care and BCC in the local dialect. Our
 trained TBAs provided safe and hygienic home deliveries.
 Subsequently informed written consent was obtained
 from parents of all study children who participated in the
 trial, prior to any study related interventions.
 
<section> Recruitment in the study
 Local tribal VHWs recruited study participants from the
 community in which they lived.
 
<section> Outcome selection by PPI
 After intensive community meetings and surveys, we
 realised that the high under-­five mortality was a health
 priority of the community. Hence, we kept U5MR and
 IMR as the primary outcome measures.
 
<section> The extent to which PPI influenced the study overall
 With the help of PPI, we could plan culturally acceptable,
 easily accessible and affordable interventions following
 community needs. Community participation played a
 crucial role in understanding the problems and appro-
 priate solutions to solve them. PPI also helped to sustain
 our study for 17 years. The government assisted in repli-
 cation of our PPI model in the 20 new villages.
 
<section> PPI involvement in dissemination of the study results to
 participants and linked communities
 The community selected VHWs, TBAs and key persons
 in the villages to implement our interventions and share
 results during gramsabhas once every 4 months and to
 mobilise the community for our programme.
 
<section> Inclusion and exclusion criteria
 The participants were under-­five children, their parents
 and pregnant women who were permanent residents
 of 34 study villages in Melghat. Children migrating
 with parents and leaving the study area for more than
 6 months were considered as having migrated perma-
 nently, and were excluded from the analyses.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 Dharni block of Melghat, consisting of 160 villages, was
 divided into five zones. The sample size required
 villages (clusters). Eight villages from each zone were
 randomly selected and two more villages from neigh-
 bouring Chikhaldara block were randomly added using
 a lottery method by a member of the study community
 in order to generalise the results beyond our block and
 to understand the impact on different blocks, with a
 different administrative structure. Out of these 42 clus-
 ters, 36 clusters were selected based on their willingness
 to participate. The clusters were block stratified according
 to their distances from the base hospital (<5 km, 5–25 km
 and >25 km). A random allocation sequence assigned
 clusters to the intervention arm (IA) and control arm
 (CA) by an external person. The allocation was masked,
 concealed and based on clusters and not on individuals.
 Participants were blinded after assignment to interven-
 tions. Infants and children in both the CA and IA received
 standard care following Government of India guidelines
 at its village, PHC and hospitals. In addition, IA received
 supervised HBCC assigned by investigators.
 The de-­ facto method 23 was used for calculation of
 mortality rates. All births and deaths actually occurring in
 the clusters or hospitals from IA and CA were included.
 A complete enumeration methodology was used to
 include all under-­fives and pregnant women in clusters.
 The VHWs collected the vital events in the two arms by
 prospective door-­to-­door surveys of the households within
 24 hours of the event. They filled the death and birth
 forms, confirmed by the parents or near relatives in the
 absence of parents, who signed the forms. Each vital event
 was confirmed by a data collection supervisor (within
 days) and a retrospective surveyor (within 6 months) by
 door-­to-­door visits to the household. All vital events were
 further confirmed by a sarpanch (elected village head)
 and a police patil (government appointed village key
 person) within 15 days of the event. We also collected
 vital data from government health and the ICDS records,
 to supplement any missing vital data. Verbal autopsies
 were conducted to by data collection supervisors and
 VHWs. Deaths were verified by the, sarpanch and police
 patil. While implementation could not be masked due
 to the visible nature of the intervention, boundaries to
 limit communication between the two arms were closely
 monitored. Patients living in the CA were not treated in
 the IA during the research phase.
 After obtaining community consent to do the trial,
 approval from the MAHAN independent ethical
 committee was obtained. Informed written consent was
 obtained from the parents of all infants and children who
 participated in the study. The study was registered with ​
 ClinicalTrials.​gov.
 
<section> Study phases
 
<section> Baseline phase: January 2004–December 2004
 
<section> Microplanning
 Participatory community meetings were held at the start
 of the study (online supplemental annexure-­ 1) that
 provided an introduction of the study to the community,
 invited their collaboration, identified resources for child
 health and finally resulted in obtaining written commu-
 nity consent from village elders at both IA and CA. Inter-
 ventions were based on inputs from qualitative focus
 group discussions and surveys regarding high-­risk behav-
 iours for child mortality, potential barriers to implemen-
 tation and taking into consideration factors affecting
 behaviour change. The study team activities in CA were:
 (a) consent of villagers, (b) census, (c) village mapping
 at the beginning of the research phase, (d) collection of
 vital statistics, for example, death, birth, verbal autop-
 sies to define the causes of deaths during the entire
 research and service phases and (e) anthropometry at
 the baseline and at the end of the research phase (online 
<section> supplemental annexure-­1). Consent was needed in the
 control area as we were collecting (a) census data, (b)
 personal vital data of birth, deaths and cause of deaths
 and (c) anthropometry of children.
 
<section> Selection and trainings of field workers
 VHWs, data collection supervisors, medical supervisor,
 BCC supervisors, programme manager, retrospective
 surveyors and TBAs as external stakeholders (online
 supplemental annexure-­2) formed the field team in IA.
 External stakeholders were from the clusters but were not
 paid workers of MAHAN trust. They assisted our HBCC
 programme to achieve its objectives. VHWs, data collec-
 tion supervisors, programme manager and retrospec-
 tive surveyors formed the field team in CA. The VHWs
 were local, tribal, married, semiliterate, socially sensitive
 women selected through community meetings. VHW’s
 received monthly trainings, details of which are provided
 in online supplemental annexure-­2.
 
<section> Data collection
 VHWs conducted a census and baseline survey regarding
 births, under-­ five deaths, maternal and child health-
 care practices and demographic information in January
 2004. They were supervised by data collection supervi-
 sors. Similar information was verified from government
 agencies, parents, cluster heads and independent retro-
 spective surveyors to detect any missed events. Verbal
 autopsies of all under-­ five deaths were conducted by
 supervisors and VHWs, and reviewed by two physicians
 using standard methods. 24 A third physician adjudicated
 discrepancies.
 Baseline data verification was done by the Rajmata
 Jijau Mother and Child Health and Nutrition Mission
 (RJMCHNM) of the state government and UNICEF.
 Data monitoring and safety was performed by the State
 Tribal Department. Finally, a third-­party evaluation was
 conducted by the Government Medical College, Aurang-
 abad, India.
 In the implementation arm of the study, the popula-
 tion size was 13 150 during the implementation/research
 phase, 10 932 during the service phase and 29 335 during
 the replication phase. The number of VHWs in the
 implementation arm were 24 during the research phase,
 20 during the service phase and 42 during the replication
 phase.
 
<section> Intervention phase: January 2005–December 2009
 Interventions were delivered by VHWs, implemented in
 a sequential phase-­wise manner and continued subse-
 quently. All VHWs were trained monthly in the first year
 with refresher trainings 2 monthly until the end of the
 study (online supplemental annexure-­2).
 
<section> Subphase 1: January 2005–December 2009
 Community-­ based management of acute respiratory
 infections, diarrhoeal illness and malaria, in post-­
 neonatal under-­ fives was done using co-­ trimoxazole
 (for pneumonia), ORS (for diarrhoea) and Furoxone/
 norfloxacin (for unresponsive diarrhoea), metronida-
 zole (for dysentery) and chloroquine syrup (for malaria)
 respectively, as per guidelines (online supplemental
 annexure-­3).
 
<section> Subphase 2: November 2006–December 2009
 Implementation of antenatal, natal and newborn care was
 added to the above post-­neonatal management (online
 supplemental annexure-­ 4). Briefly, VHW’s conducted
 three home visits and examined each pregnant mother,
 encouraged her to avail facility care and provided
 iron and calcium supplements. Tetanus immunisation
 was given by the auxiliary nurse midwife. Pregnancy-­
 induced hypertension and pedal oedema were moni-
 tored and paid special attention. Clean and safe home
 deliveries 26 27 were conducted by trained TBAs assisted
 by trained VHWs. High-­ risk pregnant women were
 referred to hospitals. 28–30 At birth the VHWs recorded
 neonatal observations and the birth weight, kept the
 baby warm, applied Gentian violet (1%) to the umbilical
 cord, administered 1 mg vitamin K intramuscularly and
 1
 initiated early breast feeding. Subsequently VHW’s did
 or 13 household visits to normal or high-­risk newborn,
 respectively, within 28 days of birth and weekly there-
 after. At subsequent household visits, breast feeding
 was observed, advise was given to mothers to keep
 babies warm and babies were observed for danger signs
 of illness and received care as outlined below. VHWs
 provided high-­risk newborn care for low-­birth weight
 and premature babies and for hypo–hyperthermia and
 breast-­feeding problems. They maintained asepsis and
 provided referral if required. VHWs identified babies
 with prematurity defined as a gestational age at birth
 of <37 weeks. 31–35 Expected date of delivery (EDD) was
 calculated from last menstrual period. VHWs main-
 tained an EDD calendar. Low birth weight was defined
 as a birth weight of ≤2500 g. 36 The weight was measured
 by VHWs and confirmed by medical supervisors using a
 salter or electronic weighing scale.
 
<section> Subphase 3: May 2007–December 2009 online supplemental
 
<section> annexure-4
 
<section> Birth asphyxia was managed by mouth–nose suction
 using an oral mucus sucker, tactile stimulation, Ambu
 bag and mask ventilation.
 Neonatal sepsis was diagnosed clinically 38 39 by the
 simultaneous presence of two of seven signs (poor
 sucking; weak cry; limp extremities; vomiting or abdom-
 inal distension; convulsions, altered consciousness;
 severe chest indrawing; umbilical infection) and babies
 were referred immediately to the hospital. When hospital
 referral was not accepted, syrup cotrimoxazole and intra-
 muscular gentamicin were administered by the VHW
 following WHO guidelines. 40
 BCC was conducted for health, hygiene, infant and
 young child feeding, malnutrition, antenatal and
 newborn care, breast feeding, diarrhoea, malaria, pneu-
 monia and growth. 
<section> We extended the intervention to only the intervention
 areas during the service phase and the replication phase.
 
<section> Service phase: January 2010–December 2015
 The healthcare delivery by VHWs was continued in the
 IA with supervision by supervisors. We continued data
 collection in CA and IA.
 
<section> Replication phase: September 2016–August 2019 (Only for the
 
<section> IA)
 
<section> The Government of Maharashtra (India) validated the
 replicability of interventions for reducing NMR, IMR and
 U5MR by randomly adding 20 new villages (population:
 19 437) from Dharni block. The government adopted
 the same methods used in the service phase for these
 villages with our collaboration. An integrated accelerated
 approach of simultaneous implementation of all inter-
 ventions was adopted following a 2-­month training for
 VHW’s and supervisors in the government villages. Due
 to a successful outcome of the trial, it was stopped after
 31 August 2019. It was evaluated by measuring reduction
 in IMR, U5MR, NMR and perinatal mortality rate (PMR)
 (total number of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths
 per 1000 total births) from baseline to the end (figure
 5). The tribal development department of government
 of Maharashtra appointed a committee from one of the
 medical schools for its evaluation.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome measures are comparisons between
 IA and CA, at both individual and cluster levels, for IMR
 and U5MR at baseline (2004) and subsequent years. The
 secondary outcome measures are NMR and PMR.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 Sample size was estimated to detect a reduction of at least
 50% in U5MR in the IA. Preliminary data from Melghat
 in 2004 estimated the U5MR at 140/1000 live births.
 The intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) for U5MR
 was assumed to be 0.01, and the average live births per
 cluster per year was 20, which resulted in a variance infla-
 tion factor or design effect of 1.19. Hence, to detect a
 desired mortality reduction of 50% in IA with 95% confi-
 dence and 80% power, a sample size of 359 live births was
 needed per arm, with 18 clusters per arm.
 Participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria were
 recruited and observed in each year of the study
 periods. The data on cluster characteristics from control
 and intervention areas, defined on a nominal scale,
 were summarised in frequencies and percentages and
 compared using the Pearson’s χ 2 test. Since the number of
 characteristics at the cluster level was large, an approach
 based on wealth quintiles was used to classify clusters into
 homogeneous subsets. The characteristics were dichoto-
 mised into 0 and 1 indicating absence or presence of the
 attribute, while distances (continuous) were retained in
 the same format. This mixed data set was subjected to
 principal component analysis (PCA) using the PCA mix
 function in the R-­programming tool. A weighted index
 was obtained for each cluster referred to as the cluster-­
 status index. On similar lines, the analysis was performed
 at the household level, based on household level char-
 acteristics, to generate a wealth index. Each index array
 was categorised into five quintiles forming five homoge-
 neous subsets, with level (I) indicating a weaker cluster
 or household, while (V) indicated better placement.
 ‘Weaker cluster’ indicates a village with poor infrastruc-
 ture. Similarly, a weaker household indicates a lack of
 essential facilities at the domestic level. ‘Better place-
 ment’ suggests villages with required infrastructure, and
 households with necessary amenities. Table 1 and online
 supplemental table 1S provide the cluster and household
 level factors determining their status.
 To assess the change in the mortality rates in different
 age categories, the crude incidence rate ratios (cIRR)
 were obtained for primary and secondary outcomes, for
 each intervention year (2005–2009) with reference to the
 base year (2004), independently for each of the two arms.
 In this year-­wise comparison, the distribution of cluster-­
 status index was altered due to the varying number of
 live births and the household level wealth index within
 clusters across years. Therefore, in the individual-­level
 analysis the incidence rate ratios for each outcome were
 adjusted for each year with respect to the base year using
 a log-­binomial regression (the adjusted incidence rate
 ratio (aIRR)). The analysis was performed independently
 for the two arms. The convergence issue of log-­binomial
 regression was not met for any of the outcomes.
 The difference between crude and adjusted incidence
 rate-­ratios between the two arms was obtained for each
 year along with 95% CIs. 42 The effect on mortality rates
 during the intervention and service and replication
 phases were assessed through the magnitude of these
 differences and the associated statistical significance.
 To determine whether the effect of the intervention
 was uniform across clusters, a cluster level analysis was
 performed and ICCs were obtained for the primary
 outcomes.
 All analyses were performed using R-­ 3.4.3 (R-­ Core
 Team 2017), and statistical significance was tested at the
 5% level. The statistician was masked to treatment groups
 while analysing the data. Interim analyses were not done.

 to non-­cooperation of health workers. The CONSORT
 (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) flow
 diagram modified for cRCT is presented in figure 1. Out
 of 4426 total infants and children included in the CA,
 2316 were live births and there were 378 deaths (163.21
 deaths per 1000 live births), while in the IA, there were
 3230 infants and children with 2299 live births and 267
 deaths (116.13 deaths per 1000 live births). The male:
 female ratios were 1.018 and 1.058 in CA and IA, respec-
 tively. The cluster-­ level characteristics were compared
 between the two study groups (table 1). The number
 of subcentres (p=0.0064) and the presence of govern-
 ment transport facility (state government transport bus
 services) (p=0.0343) were significantly better in the CA.
 The 34 clusters were classified into five levels (quin-
 tiles) based on the cluster-­status index. The distribution
 of clusters in these levels was almost uniform (ie, seven
 in each level, except level 3 with six clusters). The house-
 hold variables of under-­ five children, (online supple-
 mental table 1S), were used to obtain a Wealth Index
 and thus classify subjects into quintiles, mirroring their
 economic status. The year-­wise distribution of live births
 into five quintiles based on their cluster-­status and wealth
 index and their comparison with the base year are given
 in table 2 for both the arms. The cluster-­status index
 quintile distribution for the years 2008 and 2009 were
 significantly different from the base year (p<0.05) in the
 IA, while the Wealth Index distribution differed signifi-
 cantly from the base year for the years 2008 and 2009 in
 the CA and for 2009 in the IA. In the IA, the cluster status
 index distribution for 2008 and 2009 were significantly
 different compared with the baseline year, 2004. During
 2008 and During, 2009, there were increased cases of
 cluster status I and status IV and V compared with the
 baseline year. Due to higher proportions in the extreme
 cluster levels, the difference was significant.
 There was significantly higher proportion of subjects
 in wealth index level I in 2008 and 2009 compared with
 year 2004. In the IA, in 2009, the proportions increased
 in level I and decreased in levels II and III, resulting in
 significant differences.
 Table 3 shows the IRR computed for different infant
 and under-­five children categories across years in the two
 arms, and the per cent reduction between the two arms. 
<section> Figure 1 Cluster randomised control trial flow diagram.
 
<section> In the CA, the IMR and U5MR for the period 2005–2009
 were significantly higher than the baseline year, as indi-
 cated by cIRR >1. The differences in the distribution of
 cluster level and household level status in these years
 compared with the baseline year (table 2), were adjusted
 for and presented as aIRR (table 3). The effect of covari-
 ates on the crude rate ratios were marginal until the
 year 2007, but thereafter the reduction in the aIRR was
 noticeable (>10%) compared with their respective cIRR
 although the effects were statistically insignificant. The
 wealth index differentials primarily contributed to the
 difference in aIRRs for the years 2008–2009 (table 2).
 In the IA clusters, for the IMR and U5MR, both IRRs
 were reduced for the each of the years 2005–2009
 compared with the reference. The effects of covariates
 were noticeable as indicated by the change in IRRs
 (>10%) for the above years for the IMR. However, this
 covariate effect was not observed for the U5MR.
 The IMR and U5MR in IA were reduced from 106.60
 and 147.21 to 32.75 and 50.38 (reduction by 69.28% and
 65.78%, respectively) compared with increases in CA
 from 67.67 and 105.26 to 86.83 and 122.75, respectively,
 from baseline to end of intervention. The >50% relative
 reduction in both IMR and U5MR in the IA were signifi-
 cantly different when comparing the crude rate ratios for
 CA and IA, for each of the years 2005–2009, culminating
 in a >70% reduction in both in 2009. The relative reduc-
 tion in adjusted IRRs while not significant in the first year
 after introduction of the intervention for the IMR, were
 significantly reduced in each of the subsequent years for
 both IMR and U5MR with at least a sustained >50% rela-
 tive reduction after 2007.
 NMR in IA showed reductions from 50.76 to 22.67
 (by 55.34%) and PMR from 75.06 to 24.94 (by 66.77%)
 respectively. The secondary outcomes on NMR and PMR
 are presented in online supplemental table 2. Consis-
 tently in the CA, except for the PMR in 2006, both rates
 were consistently higher in years subsequent to the base-
 line year (increased with an average of 28.5% during the
 research phase). In contrast, for the IA for most years
 there was a reduction in both parameters. This resulted
 in significant relative reductions in both the cIRR and
 aIRR in the IA compared with the CA that were consis-
 tently above 50% after 2007.
 A cluster-­level analysis was performed in the two arms
 independently, using ICCs. Table 4 shows IMR and U5MR
 along with ICCs at baseline year (2004) and at the end of
 study year (2009) for the two arms. In both the arms, ICCs
 for IMR and U5MR were higher at baseline compared
 with end of study period. This indicates that the between-­
 cluster variability was higher at baseline, which declined
 at the end of the intervention period in both the arms.
 For infant mortality, in the IA, the per cent ICC change
 was 82.95% (95% CI 77.76% to 88.13%), which was
 significantly higher than that of CA (45.83%) (95% CI
 24.52% to 67.13%). For the U5MR, in IA the reduction
 of ICC was 46.15% (95% CI 26.83% to 65.47%), which
 was better than CA 31.85% (95% CI 5.99% to 57.70%).

 The reduction in primary outcomes in the IA during
 the intervention phase was maintained during the service
 phase for the next 6 years (figure 2). In the CA, there was
 a reduction in IMR and U5MR from 2014 onwards when
 the government started an HBNC intervention. The
 IRRs and relative reductions for primary outcomes for all
 phases are shown in figure 3. In the service period, the
 reductions for IMR and U5MR were consistently below

 During the replication phase, the baseline IMR and
 U5MR were reduced from 71.63and 85.96 to 28.50 and
 45.13, respectively (figure 5). The NMR and PMR were
 reduced from 51.58 and 48.02 to 16.63 and 23.47, respec-

 significant (p=0.071 and p=0.1763, respectively). There
 were no harms or unintended effects in either group.

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> Our study shows a major reduction in primary and
 secondary outcomes in the IA compared with the CA
 at the end of the Research Phase. The integrated multi-
 pronged approach to HBCC resulted in significant
 reductions of U5MR and IMR in this high-­mortality area.
 The reduction in intercluster correlation coefficients for
 both IMR and U5MR in the IA shows that variability of
 outcomes between clusters declined at the end of the
 intervention period. The per cent change for IMR in the
 IA was highest, indicating that the significant reduction
 in IMR was nearly consistent across all clusters by the end
 of study. This consistency was much higher than the CA.
 Similarly, the per cent reduction in ICC for U5MR in
 the IA was higher than that of CA, indicating uniform
 effectiveness of the intervention in the IA. The increased
 mortality rate in the control arm might have occurred
 due to changing priorities of senior district administra-
 tors (as a part of government policy)
 After completion of the Research Phase, the reduction
 in mortality indicators was maintained during the Service
 Phase of the next 6 years in the IA, mimicking the situation
 of large-­ scale public health programmes. This indicates
 the feasibility of programme implementation at scale. The
 consistency of reduction in IMR and U5MR prompted the
 Government of Maharashtra in India to extend the method-
 ology using government resources. The replicability of the
 model was then proven by the decline in all the mortality
 rates in the 20 new villages during the Replication Phase.
 This series of sequential studies has now been instrumental
 in driving subsequent governmental programmes.
 We provide the following example directly related
 to this study, to empower the many non-­governmental
 organisations and researchers in India and other coun-
 tries with carefully collected, verified data of their own,
 to challenge data collected by less vigorous, transparent
 collection methods and work with local, state and national
 governments to effect policy changes.
 This study has a significant impact on state govern-
 ment policies. (a) In Melghat, the MAHAN study, found
 an IMR of 96 per 1000 live births whereas the ICDS data
 recorded IMR at 31. The government and UNICEF veri-
 fied this discrepancy by actual field visits and approved
 MAHAN findings. (b) The government could not ignore
 this more reliable MAHAN survey data as it generated
 more attention to combating U5MR in the state, espe-
 cially in the poorer rural districts. 25 This lead to the
 formation of the ‘RJMCHNM’, 25 by the state government
 to work in collaboration with UNICEF for reduction of
 U5MR in Maharashtra. (c) Subsequently the Indian and
 Maharashtra State Government funded and replicated
 HBCC, in 33 villages of Melghat. (d) Before 2013, grass-
 root front line health workers were not allowed to use
 antibiotics for the treatment of post-­neonatal childhood
 infections, which policy was changed by a state govern-
 ment committee, based in part on this study by MAHAN
 and another one by SEARCH.

 The Government of India has empowered Accredited
 Social Health Worker for HBNC. However, this does
 not include management of neonatal sepsis or birth
 asphyxia, which is still a lacuna. Today, 33% of deliveries
 are home deliveries in rural India. The facilities for treat-
 ment of neonatal diseases are available at an average
 distance of 32 km from villages. Trauma due to transport
 of sick neonates in suboptimal conditions endanger lives,
 reflecting high NMR, as also proved by Mori et al.
 
<section> Our model is cost-­ effective as the average cost of
 treatment of each child including the research cost
 in this project was Indian National Rupees (Rs.)
 (US$8) per year (unpublished data). In comparison the
 National Sample Survey Organisation revealed that the
 average total treatment expenditure per patient in rural
 and urban areas for outpatient management is Rs.509
 (US$6.8) and Rs.639 (US$8.6), and hospitalisation
 Rs.16 956 (US$229.1) and Rs.26 455 (US$357.5) respec-
 tively. We plan to conduct a formal cost-­effectiveness
 analysis.
 Our study follows many of the principles of the census-­
 based, impact-­ oriented approach. 44 These principles
 
<section> included the following: 
<section> 1. We developed a cooperative partnership with local
 communities.
 2. We worked together with the local community, iden-
 tified and decided their heath priorities. We planned
 and implemented the programme as per need of the
 community.
 3. Our interventions included regular planned home vis-
 its.
 4. We regularly measured the impact of our interven-
 tions on health of the children until the age of 5 years.
 Our study highlights the importance of community
 sensitisation, acceptance and participation. Our active
 and effective system of community-­based VHWs made
 this programme successful.
 Integrated management of childhood illnesses
 (IMCI) 45 has been implemented in India from 2003
 onward for wider community coverage and impact. The
 original IMCI was primarily first level facility based, did
 not include care of the sick early newborn (the time
 when one in three child deaths occurs) and it did not
 emphasise HBNC. The newborn component was added
 to the integrated management of neonatal and child-
 hood illnesses (IMNCI) programme in India in 2004.
 Unfortunately, IMNCI has not been successful in India,
 despite having sound principles. It was the implementa-
 tion of the programme that faltered not only in India but
 in many other countries. The reasons for the failure of
 the programme were: irregular funding, lack of refresher
 trainings of fieldworkers, poor supervision/mentor-
 ship, 47 irregular availability of key supplies, weak referral
 hospitals and frequent transfer of staff. 48 _ENREF_34 A
 2017 review of community IMCI found only one RCT
 that showed a reduction of 8% in under-­five mortality
 after 2 years using cIMCI.
 Recognising these challenges globally, WHO in
 conjunction with UNICEF and USAID launched iCCM,
 iCCM in Africa (2012). A Cochrane review of iCCM
 programmes found no impact on child mortality due
 to poor study design of the trials. 50 These faced crit-
 ical challenges due to lack of integration into national
 health systems, lack of political commitment and non-­
 coordination with funding agencies. Funding was largely
 dependent on development partners, and sustainability
 of funding remained a critical concern for delivery of
 iCCM services. The problems in supply of commodities,
 utilisation, scale, quality, financing and monitoring of
 services were not resolved. A strong referral system for
 facility-­ based treatment was not developed simultane-
 ously, and, finally, iCCM policy did not include treatment
 of neonatal sepsis.
 In India at present, complete HBCC has not been
 implemented by the government. The major obstacles
 in implementing community-­based health programmes
 in India are: poor trainings and monitoring of grassroot
 workers, poor referral support for quality treatment, the
 rigid hierarchical structure of the health system, failure
 to incorporate community participation into large-­scale
 primary healthcare programmes 52 and opposition from
 professional bodies such as the Indian Medical Associa-
 tion and the Indian Academy of Pediatrics. Nevertheless,
 the Government of Maharashtra has taken many steps to
 implement HBNC in high mortality rural areas. Critically,
 the HBCC programme did not require strengthening of
 the primary healthcare facilities or of the referral facili-
 ties, which are still a major obstacle in most developing
 countries. Empowering community workers to provide
 basic and advanced care for the well and sick child and
 the provision of basic essential medicines obviates the
 need for the most part for referral and will decrease the
 burden on these facilities if widely implemented, making
 it a much more cost-­effective strategy.
 VHWs played a critical role to reduce the mortality
 in the community and provided appropriate grassroots
 healthcare. Community health workers (CHWs) are
 essential for achieving the health-­ related Sustainable
 Development Goals. 53 A significant increase in contin-
 uous funding for CHW programmes is needed. National
 and state governments should increase political support
 for prioritising CHW programmes during economic
 growth and make additional health-­related funding avail-
 able. This paradigm shift will be an essential step in esca-
 lating development in achieving current global health
 goals and in reaching the goal of Health for All.
 The limitations of this trial include possible spillover
 effects as the CA and the IA were in contiguous areas. There
 were differences in between IA and CA for baseline IMR,
 U5MR and the household level characteristics, although
 they were adjusted during analysis by obtaining a wealth
 index. Finally, this strategy might not be applicable for
 the urban setting. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
 were not used for malaria diagnosis during research and
 service phase. It was based on a clinical diagnosis after
 excluding other causes of fever. Our VHWs used malaria
 RDTs during the government replication phase. This was
 a relatively small study and it might be difficult to scale up
 this complex HBCC approach. However, the principles,
 methods, VHW monitoring, simple treatment modalities
 and collaboration with government makes this a feasible
 modality for reductions of IMR and U5MR in the Indian
 subcontinent and other LMICs.
 In conclusion, progressive policies on CHW
 programmes must be backed up by concrete institutional
 support to enable CHWs to fulfil their role. 55 While
 VHWs are not a panacea for weak health systems, they
 can make a major contribution to health system strength-
 ening if they have focused tasks, adequate remunera-
 tion and the active involvement of the communities in
 which they work. 19 Thus the prerequisites for successful
 programme delivery are: (a) Selection of a VHW through
 a transparent community participatory process based on
 merit, (b) Intensive, focused regular trainings and moni-
 toring of VHWs, (c) Maintenance of the supply chain, (d)
 The programme must be backed up by concrete institu-
 tional support. HBCC is possible with local resources. It is
 affordable, acceptable, measurable, safe, achievable and
 effective. It should be replicable in other impoverished 
<section> areas of the world having inadequate medical facilities
 
<section> and a high U5MR.
