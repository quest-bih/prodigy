<section> p.o.iversen@medisin.uio.no tors for impaired child development [3]. In line with this, undernourished children 
<section> are at risk of impaired structural development of the central nervous system (CNS) and extra- neuronal
 tissue [4]. Adequate childhood nutrition thus promotes healthy growth and development outcomes [5-7].
 
<section> The underlying causes of chronic undernutrition are complex. In addition to inadequate food quantity
 and quality of food, a combination of poor sanitation and hygiene resulting in sustained exposure to en-
 teric pathogens plays an important role [8]. Pregnancy and the first two years of life are important peri-
 ods for interventions to improve child growth and cognitive development, and can be considered both a
 window of vulnerability as well as a window of opportunity [9]. The development of the gut microbiota
 is mostly accomplished within the first three years of life. Interventions directed towards an appropriate
 maturation of the gut microbiota and its associated metabolic potential, may support healthy growth and
 cognitive development [10]. In line with this, there are new insights into how the CNS and cognitive de-
 velopment may be influenced by the gut microbiota through the so-called “gut-brain axis” [11]. More-
 over, a number of studies report systematic differences in the composition between rural Africa and ur-
 ban Europe, indicating that the gut microbiota is tailored to local diet, specific nutritional requirements
 of the host and hygiene practices [12-14]. However, a possible role of gut microbiota in undernutrition
 and child development has not been adequately addressed. Inadequate caregiving skills and stimulation
 can also adversely impact development and growth of small children, in particular in low-resource set-
 tings. Integration of nutrition and stimulation in a Pakistani trial highlighted a potential for child devel-
 opment and linear growth benefits [5].
 
<section> In 2013 we initiated a cluster-randomized controlled trial to examine the effect on growth and develop-
 ment of a 6-month intervention comprised of nutrition, stimulation and hygiene education among im-
 poverished mothers of children aged 6-8 months in rural districts of Uganda [15]. The intervention con-
 sisted of educating mothers aimed at (i) increasing dietary diversity to improve nutrient intake as well as
 continued breastfeeding, (ii) improving hygiene and sanitation practices, and (iii) enhancing stimulation
 based on a social-cognitive learning theory to improve development. Whereas this intervention did not
 alter child growth at the age of 20-24 months, cognitive, language and motor development improved
 markedly [15]. In order to examine if these findings were sustainable over time, we decided to perform a
 follow-up study. Notably, a long term follow-up of such a nutrition education intervention has previously
 not been done in a resource-constrained setting as Uganda. We now examined development, growth and
 gut microbiota composition among a subsample of these children at the age of 36 months.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Study design and approvals
 
<section> This is a follow-up study of a two-armed, open cluster-randomized education intervention regarding nu-
 trition, stimulation and hygiene among impoverished mothers of children aged 6-8 months in the Kisoro
 and Kabale districts of South-Western Uganda. Details of the intervention have recently been published
 [15]. All mothers gave written or thumb-printed, informed consent to participate and could decline an
 interview or assessment at any time. The study was approved by The AIDS Support Organisation Research
 Ethics Committee (No. TASOREC/06/15-UG-REC-009) and by the Uganda National Council for Science
 and Technology (No. UNCST HS 1809) as well as by the Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical and
 Health Research Ethics (No. 2013/1833). The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02098031).
 We report the data according to the CONSORT guidelines.
 
<section> Randomisation of the parental and follow-up participants
 
<section> For the parental trial we used proportionate sampling, 10 sub-counties (ie, clusters) were obtained (6 out
 of 19 in Kabale and 4 out of 14 in Kisoro) to participate in the study. We used a three-stage procedure to
 identify households for the study. First, by simple random sampling, three sub-counties in Kabale were
 allocated to the intervention group and the other three to the control group. Similarly, two sub-counties
 were allocated to the intervention and the other two to the control group in Kisoro district. Second, all the
 villages in each participating sub-county (intervention or control) were listed alphabetically and assigned
 numbers in an ascending order. By use of computer-generated random numbers, villages to whose as-
 signed number matched with the random numbers were selected. The intervention villages did not share
 common geographical boundaries with control villages to minimize contamination of the intervention
 contents between the two study groups. Third, by complete enumeration, all consenting households with
 children aged 6-8 months within a participating village were recruited to the study. If a household had Child development, growth and microbiota
 
<section> more than one eligible child, the youngest was selected, and in the case of twins, we randomly selected
 one for evaluation. We finally enrolled 511 mother-child pairs in the parental study and they were ran-
 domised to the intervention (n = 263) or the control (n = 248) group. The intervention group received the
 nutrition, hygiene and stimulation education in addition to routine health care while the control group
 received only routine health care.
 
<section> The child had to be 20-24 months during the period of January-May 2015 to be included in the current
 follow-up study since age dynamic gut microbial shifts occur at this age resulting in an adult-like, stable
 composition [16], and developmental milestones at this age may predict IQ at 5-6 years when children
 are about to start school [17]. Based on a sample size calculation we then randomly selected participants
 from each of the two study groups (n = 77 from the intervention group and n = 78 from the control group).
 Data was collected when the children were 20-24 months and at 36 months. The data collection teams in
 the follow-up study were masked to group allocation and never had any interaction with the study team
 that delivered the education intervention in the parental trial.
 
<section> Contents of the education intervention in the parental trial
 
<section> The intervention was conducted by the study team at three group meetings over a period of 6 months to
 26 groups of mothers (6-10 mothers per group), and was detailed recently [15]. Briefly, it was delivered
 by a trained education team and included two behavior change techniques: providing information and
 prompt practice (ie, demonstrations of preparing food and stimulation of the children). The nutrition ed-
 ucation curriculum was based on the 10 guiding principles of complementary feeding [18]. Recipes were
 formulated and cooking demonstrated using locally available foods with emphasis on protein. Moreover,
 the need to take ill children to hospital for medical attention and to increase the feeding frequency during
 and after illness was emphasized. Hand-washing before feeding as well as use of clean utensils during food
 preparation and feeding was part of the hygiene intervention. A novel aspect of this intervention was the
 focus on oral hygiene, and with distribution of tooth brushes to all household members and demonstra-
 tion of their use. The education team highlighted the importance of play to improve cognitive, language
 and motor development. The stimulation intervention was based on social-cognitive learning theory [19].
 
<section> In addition to the three group meetings, the women met at monthly intervals to practice what they had
 learnt and ensuring compliance to the intervention [15].
 
<section> Assessments of outcomes
 
<section> The child development assessments were performed by three bachelor degree holders in psychology
 whereas two graduates of laboratory technology collected stool samples. Two bachelor degree holders
 in nutrition collected the anthropometric data. These three data collection teams participated in train-
 ing sessions to ensure uniform and standardized procedures. Assessments were administered in the local
 language and conducted in hired, secluded rooms in the villages without interruptions to minimize dis-
 tractions. To promote reliability, the child development assessments were administered first, followed by
 anthropometric measurements, stool sampling and then interviews with the mothers.
 The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (BSID-III), the Ages and Stages Questionnaire
 (ASQ) and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL; Supplementary information) were used [15]. The
 BSID-III scale is known to be the most comprehensive child development measure for children up to
 3.5 years and has been adapted and used in similar settings [20]. The ASQ is a parent/caregiver complet-
 ed screening scale with excellent psychometric properties which capture and establish a wide range of
 adaptive behaviors, and previously used in this setting [21]. Both tools were used because we did not in-
 clude the social-emotional scale of BSID-III. The BSID-III and the ASQ were administered at 20-24 and
 at 36 months. MSEL was introduced at 36 months to assess early intellectual development and readi-
 ness for school, and it has been validated for use in rural Uganda [22]. Inter-observation agreement be-
 tween the child assessment team was good indicated by an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.75
 (P = 0.0001) for BSI-III, 0.79 (P = 0.0001) for ASQ and 0.77 (P < 0.001) for MSEL.
 
<section> Weight, height, and head circumference (HC) were measured as recommended by WHO [21], with a
 Seca-scale model 881 (Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height was measured (to the near-
 est 0.1 cm) with a Seca board (SO114530). HC was measured with a non-stretchable tape (Seca,
 S0145630 PAC-50). Anthropometric data were converted to z-scores, height-for-age (HAZ), weight-
 for-age (WAZ), weight-for-height (WHZ), and head circumference (HCZ), using the Anthro (version
 3.2.2) software, a nutritional assessment tool based on WHO standards. A z-score<-2 SD from the me-

<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Study participants
 
<section> One hundred and fifty-five mother-child pairs
 were included at 20-24 months (Figure 1). By
 36 months, eight of them were lost to follow-up
 (three in the intervention group and five in the
 control group). There were no significant differ-
 ences in the characteristics between the paren-
 tal cohort (data obtained at baseline) and the fol-
 low-up cohort (data obtained at 20-24 months;
 
<section> Table 1), thus no adjustments for baseline differ-
 ences were made in subsequent analyses.
 
<section> Development outcomes
 
<section> Overall, the intervention significantly improved
 all child development outcomes (ie, cognitive,
 language and motor composite scores) based on
 the BSID-III at 36 months (Table 2). The Cohen’s
 d effect sizes at 36 months were medium (cogni-
 tive 0.57, language 0.56 and motor 0.50). The ef-
 fect of the intervention on the ASQ mean scores
 for communication, gross motor, problem solv-
 ing, and personal social development, was sig-

 learning composite standard scores were significantly higher in the intervention compared to the con-
 trols at 36 months (Table 4). In contrast, the MSEL visual reception scores were not different between
 the two study groups. The corresponding mean Cohen’s d effect sizes were: 0.23, 0.44, 0.34, 0.42, 0.42,
 and 0.36 for MSEL visual reception, fine motor, receptive language, expressive language, cognitive total
 score and early learning score, respectively.
 
<section> Growth outcomes
 
<section> The mean HAZ declined in both study groups during the study period, indicating linear growth faltering
 (Table 5). However, this decline was significantly less at 36 months in the intervention compared with
 the control group. There were no significant differences in the other mean anthropometric measures (ie,
 WAZ, WHZ, and HCZ) at 36 months. The Cohen’s d effect sizes at 36 months were 1.01, 0.16, -0.46,
 and 0.30 for HAZ, WAZ, WHZ, and HCZ, respectively.
 
<section> Gut microbiota composition
 
<section> The intervention did not lead to any significant changes in the gut microbiota diversity compared with the
 control group at the phylum level (Figure 2). Neither did we observe any significant differences between
 the two study groups in the Shannon diversity index at the two time points (Figure 3). However, as ex-
 pected the Shannon diversity index increased significantly in both study groups from 20-24 to 36 months,
 indicating increased gut microbiota diversity, while there was no significant change in the overall genera
 distribution from 20-24 to 36 months. In line with this, there was no change in the variable 1-Simpson
 index between the two study groups at the two time points (Figure 3), and this variable increased from
 20-24 to 36 months, again indicating increased gut microbiota diversity. In support of these findings, the

 Child development, growth and microbiota
 
<section> PERMANOVA analysis revealed that there was a significant change in the composition of the gut micro-
 biota from 20-24 to 36 months, both at the genus (P = 0.001) and at the phylum (P = 0.001) level, but
 that there was no significant effect (P = 1) of the intervention on the overall gut microbiota composition.
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> This is probably the first randomized education intervention trial incorporating gut microbiota analysis
 in rural Sub-Saharan Africa. In the parental trial the 6-month education intervention led to significant
 improvements in development outcomes when the children reached 20-24 months, without affecting
 growth [15]. We now show a sustained improvement in the development outcomes even at 36 months
 and with the use of three independent tools. The intervention also reduced linear growth faltering until
 36 months, but had no effect on gut microbiota composition.

 Our effect sizes on child development outcomes were

 that included nutrition supplementation and child stim-
 ulation intervention [5,29,30]. Studies from low income
 countries using the BSID-III to assess development found
 that children who received both nutrition and respon-
 sive stimulation reported higher cognitive, language and
 motor skills compared to those who only received either
 nutrition or stimulation [25,31]. Notably, most of these
 studies provided micronutrient supplementation and play
 materials whereas we educated the mothers without sup-
 porting them with either food or toys. Mother-child play
 interaction models promote children’s engagement in sev-
 eral activities that enhance development [32]. Moreover,
 our findings are in accordance with a previous Ugandan
 study which reported slightly higher cognitive scores three
 months after stimulation and nutrition education [20].
 
<section> The baseline stunting levels observed in the two study
 groups compare favorably with those of previous sur-
 veys in Uganda [33]. Corroborating the anthropometric
 results obtained when the children were 20-24 months
 [15], most growth indicators were not significantly differ-
 ent between the two study groups at 36 months. The only
 exception was a smaller reduction in linear growth falter-
 ing in the intervention compared with the control group.
 This could imply that the education intervention may have
 a protective effect against linear growth faltering over time.
