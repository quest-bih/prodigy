<section> Abstract
 
<section> Recent evidence indicates mass azithromycin distribution reduces under-5 mortality. This
 intervention is being considered for child survival programs in high mortality sub-Saharan
 African settings. The delivery approach used in prior studies required a full-time census and
 distribution team, which is not feasible for most programs. To determine the optimal pro-
 grammatic approach to delivery, this study aimed to compare treatment coverage, costs,
 and acceptability of different delivery approaches with existing community health workers
 (CHWs). This cluster-randomized trial included rural and peri-urban communities in Dosso,
 Niger (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04774991). A random sample of 80 eligible communities was
 randomized 1:1 to biannual door-to-door or fixed-point delivery of oral azithromycin to chil-
 dren 1–59 months old over 1 year. Data analysts alone were masked given the nature of the
 intervention. The primary outcome was community-level treatment coverage defined as the
 number of children treated recorded by CHWs divided by the number of eligible children
 determined using a post-distribution census. Costs were monitored through routine adminis-
 trative data collection and micro-costing. The census included survey questions on interven-
 tion acceptability among caregivers, community leaders, and CHWs. After randomization,
 community was excluded due to inaccuracies in available administrative data, resulting in
 39 communities receiving door-to-door delivery. At the second distribution, community-level
 mean treatment coverage was 105% (SD 44%) in the door-to-door arm and 92% (SD 20%)
 in the fixed-point arm (Mean difference 13%, 95% CI -2% to 28%, P-value = 0.08). The total
 cost per dose delivered was $1.91 in the door-to-door arm and $2.51 in the fixed-point arm.
 Indicators of acceptability were similar across stakeholder groups in both arms, with most

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Substantial heterogeneity in the global burden of under-5 mortality (U5MR) persists, with the
 West and Central Africa region reporting 95 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2019, 19 times
 higher than the U5MR reported in high income settings [1, 2]. These settings are estimated to
 require unprecedented rates of decline to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal targets
 for under-5 mortality by 2030 [1–3]. Azithromycin distribution has been demonstrated to be
 an effective approach to reducing child mortality. The Macrolides Oraux pour Réduire les
 Décès avec un Oeil sur la Résistance trial (MORDOR) found that biannual distribution of oral
 azithromycin to children 1–59 months old reduced mortality by 14% in Malawi, Niger, and
 Tanzania after 2 years [4]. A longer-term follow-up of the Niger site and a pooled analysis of
 available data on azithromycin distribution and child mortality from several sub-Saharan Afri-
 can settings echoed these findings [5, 6]. In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
 released conditional guidelines suggesting this intervention be considered in some high mor-
 tality settings in sub-Saharan Africa [7].
 As this intervention transitions from trial to program settings, questions remain about opti-
 mal approaches to delivery. The mortality studies conducted to date used a more resource-
 intensive approach than would be feasible for programmatic delivery. The studies involved
 full-time, dedicated study teams to sensitize communities, administer the intervention, and
 track progress through biannual door-to-door visits throughout the study areas. Programs,
 however, might work within existing health delivery systems and involve teams that are man-
 aging multiple priorities. The objective of this study was to evaluate common programmatic
 approaches to intervention delivery using existing community health workers (CHWs). We
 used an implementation science framework with a cluster randomized trial design to compare
 community-based door-to-door and fixed-point delivery of azithromycin distribution for
 child survival across several indicators, including coverage, costs, acceptability, appropriate-
 ness, and fidelity at multiple stakeholder levels [8]. A cluster randomized design was used
 given the community-based nature of the intervention. We hypothesized that door-to-door
 delivery would have higher coverage, higher costs, and similar acceptability, appropriateness,
 and fidelity compared to fixed-point delivery.
 
<section> Materials and methods
 
<section> Trial design
 
<section> This parallel arm cluster randomized trial randomized 80 rural communities in Niger to
 receive biannual azithromycin distribution by CHWs using door-to-door or fixed-point deliv-
 ery. The unit of randomization was the grappe, an administrative unit defined in Niger and
 hereafter referred to as “community.” The study period included two distributions approxi-
 mately 6 months apart, with outcomes measured at the second distribution. The present
 implementation study was conducted concurrently with a larger effectiveness trial in the same
 area [9]. The study design and reporting followed TIDieR and CONSORT guidelines (S1 and
 S2 Checklists) [10, 11]. 
<section> Ethics and oversight
 
<section> Approval for this trial was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards at the Niger Ministry
 of Health (Comité Nationale Éthique pour la Recherche en Santé, N 041/2020/CNERS) and the
 University of California, San Francisco (19–28387). At the community level, verbal consent
 was obtained from community and local health center leaders before study activities com-
 menced. At the individual level, informed consent was obtained from caregivers before study
 procedures were conducted, with written consent obtained for children 30–42 days old and
 verbal consent obtained for children older than 42 days. Written consent was required for the
 younger age group given the potential risk of macrolide-associated infantile hypertrophic pylo-
 ric stenosis that has been suggested in studies conducted in other settings [12]. An indepen-
 dent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee was empaneled to review the study protocol,
 procedures, and participant safety in the concurrent effectiveness and implementation trials.
 The present trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04774991). Additional information
 regarding the ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations specific to inclusivity in global
 research is included in the Supporting Information (S1 Questionnaire).
 
<section> Setting and participants
 
<section> Eligibility criteria for communities included location in the Dosso region, population between
 250 and 2500 inhabitants according to the 2012 national census, distance greater than 5 kilo-
 meters from the district headquarters town, and consent of community leaders. Communities
 indicated as urban on the national census were excluded. The same community-level criteria
 defined eligibility in the concurrent trial [9]. From this overall pool of eligible communities,
 simple random samples were used to select communities for participation in each trial,
 enabling generalizability of results across trials. At the individual level, children 1–59 months
 of age weighing at least 4 kg whose caregivers provided informed consent were eligible for
 inclusion. Recruitment for the overall project began in November 2020.
 
<section> Interventions
 
<section> In both arms, the intervention consisted of biannual distribution of a single dose of oral azi-
 thromycin to children 1–59 months by existing relais communautaires (CHWs). CHWs are
 chosen by the communities they serve and they live in or near the communities themselves,
 facilitating a variety of health education and care activities, with a particular focus on maternal
 and child health. As Centres de Santé Integrés (CSIs, primary health care centers) oversee the
 work of the CHWs, the study team trained CSI leaders to conduct the interventions and these
 leaders in turned conducted the training of the CHWs themselves. All trainings consisted of
 one day of lecture and hands-on practice determining eligibility, obtaining consent, determin-
 ing dose, administering the intervention, and completing the paper data collection form. The
 study team conducted supervision visits to monitor the conduct of the interventions.
 In both arms, a sensitization campaign was performed by members of the study team, dis-
 trict health communication team, and the CSI leaders before distributions began. This
 included a community meeting at the home of the chef du village (community leader) to pres-
 ent the purpose and nature of the study and answer questions. Communities were notified of
 the distribution date one day before it occurred by the leader of the relevant CSI.
 Two CHWs participated in the distributions. Azithromycin (Zithromax) was administered
 as oral suspension at 20 mg/kg of bodyweight up to the adult dose of 1 g. Dose was determined
 by weight for children 1–11 months of age or those unable to stand using an electronic hang-
 ing scale (ADE M111600, Hamburg, Germany). A table with the doses corresponding to possi-
 ble weight ranges was provided to each CHW to facilitate the process. For children older than 
<section> 11 months, dose was determined with the height-based dosing tape used by Niger’s trachoma
 program. The azithromycin powder for oral suspension was reconstituted using bottled water
 and each dose was measured into a new dosing cup or syringe for children too young to drink
 from a dosing cup. Each CHW recorded the number of doses administered by sex and age cat-
 egory (1–11 month or 12–59 months), reasons for ineligibility or refusal, and the number of
 days required for the distribution. CHWs were asked to complete each community’s distribu-
 tion within 3 days for the first round and in 2 days for the second round, though they were
 able to work as many days as required to cover the community.
 In communities randomized to receive the door-to-door delivery approach, CHWs visited
 each household in the community on foot and asked if children 1–59 months of age resided
 there to identify eligible children for inclusion. In communities randomized to fixed-point
 delivery, the CHWs worked with local leaders to identify an appropriate central location for
 the distribution. Common locations included outside the home of the community leader and
 the local mosque. A table and chairs were set up outdoors at the central location and the mobi-
 lizers would remind residents of the date, time, and location of the distribution in advance.
 Caregivers and children presented to the central location and the CHW then determined
 eligibility.
 In both arms, all study team members and CHWs wore face masks during training and
 intervention activities and sanitized or washed hands with soap and water between each
 administration. All intervention activities took place outdoors with distancing of 6 feet main-
 tained where possible.
 A door-to-door census was conducted after each distribution to determine the total number
 of eligible children 1–59 months old. The census conducted after the second distribution
 included a survey of stakeholder perceptions of the accessibility, acceptability, and feasibility
 the intervention. Stakeholders included caregivers, CHWs, and community leaders. The cen-
 sus was conducted within a 2-week window after the distributions so as not to influence the
 conduct of the intervention and to order include the post-treatment survey. Verbal informed
 consent was obtained at the household and individual level for participation in the survey. Eli-
 gible caregivers were those with a child eligible for the distribution and eligible CHWs were
 those who participated in the distribution. All community leaders were invited to participate.
 Eligibility for all survey groups included presence in the household at the time of the census.
 
<section> Adverse events
 
<section> During the consent process, CHWs informed caregivers of the common adverse events experi-
 enced with azithromycin, including adnominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and skin
 rash, as well as the possibility of severe adverse events including infantile hypertrophic pyloric
 stenosis. Caregivers were instructed to report any adverse events experienced in the 28 days
 following treatment to the CHW, who then reported to the study team by phone. Serious
 adverse events were reported by email to Pfizer and to the medical monitors, which included
 one Niger-based pediatric infectious disease specialist and one US-based ophthalmologist with
 extensive experience in azithromycin distributions for trachoma.
 
<section> Data collection
 
<section> Baseline characteristics of communities and CHWs involved routine data available from CSIs
 on total and target population size, distance to CSI and distance to the nearest town. Data were
 also collected on the CHWs themselves during training. CHWs recorded information about
 treatment administration on paper data collection forms. The forms included the number of
 doses delivered by age and sex, reasons for not treating, and adverse events. Forms were 
<section> reviewed for accuracy and completeness during supervision and then entered into CommCare
 (CommCare by Dimagi) by the study team once distributions were completed. The supervi-
 sion team also collected data on fidelity of the intervention rollout directly into a CommCare
 mobile application. The census was conducted by a separate study team using a CommCare
 mobile application that included data collection on household location, number and demo-
 graphics of household members, and a survey of stakeholder perceptions of the accessibility,
 acceptability, and fidelity of the intervention implementation. Identifiable information was
 collected during the census and removed for analysis.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> All outcomes were defined at the community level using a combination of the Proctor Imple-
 mentation Outcomes and RE-AIM frameworks and were assessed at the second distribution
 [8, 13, 14]. The primary outcome was community-level treatment coverage (reach), defined
 the number of doses administered according to the data collection form divided by the total
 eligible population according to the post-distribution census. The separation of data collection
 for the numerator and denominator used to calculate treatment coverage resulted in uncer-
 tainty in the denominator since the census may have captured a slightly different population
 than the one present for the distribution. This resulted in coverage of > 100% for some com-
 munities. To evaluate the impact of this uncertainty, two alternative outcome definitions were
 used: one using the CSI estimate of the under-5 population as an alternative denominator and
 another capping treatment coverage estimates at 100%. Exploratory subgroup analyses
 included those to assess equity of treatment coverage by sex, age, community ethnicity, com-
 munity population size, and community distance to the nearest health center.
 Secondary outcomes included costs. As costs were anticipated to be higher for the first dis-
 tribution given the additional expense associated with launching a new program, cost out-
 comes focused on the second distribution but are presented for both distributions. Costs were
 estimated through micro-costing, using known costs for personnel, training, and supplies
 required to distribute azithromycin at the community level. All costs were validated by com-
 paring micro-costing estimates with routine administrative expenditure forms. Although for
 the trial each CHW was guaranteed a standard payment regardless of the number of days
 worked, for our micro-costing we included a per diem payment for CHW based on the actual
 number of days each CHW worked, which better reflects real-world compensation for CHW
 in Niger. As a sensitivity analysis, we also estimated cost outcomes using the standard pay-
 ment. We calculated the cost per dose delivered by arm and round, with the main analyses pre-
 senting overall costs. Overall costs were chosen for main analyses as this method implicitly
 weights communities based on size and is most relevant to overall budget considerations.
 Community-level costs are presented as a sensitivity analysis, as these measures allow us to
 capture and quantify cost variability between communities.
 Other secondary outcomes included an alternative indicator of coverage (reach), accept-
 ability, appropriateness, and fidelity of the intervention at the participant and provider levels
 as measured through the post-distribution survey after the second distribution. The alternative
 indicator of coverage was the caregiver self-report of uptake of the intervention for eligible
 children. Acceptability of the intervention was defined as stakeholder perception that the con-
 duct of the intervention was satisfactory and that the intervention was accessible. Appropriate-
 ness was defined as stakeholder perception of the utility of the intervention and approach to
 delivery. Fidelity of the intervention was defined as the degree to which the intervention was
 conducted as intended in the protocol and was measured by adherence to the protocol steps
 recorded during supervision visits and survey questions confirming the effectiveness of the 
<section> publicity. Survey questions were drafted in French and discussed among the full study team
 confirm they captured the intended outcome and census workers were trained to ask each
 question in local languages. A summary of how the survey questions map to the outcome defi-
 nitions is included in S1 Appendix.
 
<section> Randomization and masking
 
<section> Eighty communities were randomly selected from the eligible pool of communities in the
 Dosso region. The randomization sequence was prepared by the UCSF biostatistician in R (R
 Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Communities were randomized
 equally to the two arms in a 1:1 ratio without stratification or matching. Community selection
 and allocation were shared with the Niger study team who enrolled communities and ensured
 communities received their assigned intervention. Given the nature of the intervention, partic-
 ipants, investigators, and study personnel implementing the intervention were not masked to
 allocation. Outcome assessors conducting the post-distribution census were not informed of
 the intervention but were not able to be completely masked since responses to the survey ques-
 tions could reveal allocation. The data analyst conducting data management and analyses was
 masked to allocation.
 
<section> Statistical methods
 
<section> Assuming a community-level standard deviation of 8.2% based on prior treatment coverage
 data from the MORDOR trial [4], including 40 communities per arm (80 communities total)
 was expected to provide 80% power to detect an absolute difference in mean community treat-
 ment coverage of 5% at an alpha of 0.05. Baseline characteristics were summarized descrip-
 tively and compared with t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables and
 Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. The primary analysis aimed to compare the cluster-
 level mean treatment coverage by arm, using permutation to estimate the P-value. The sensi-
 tivity analyses using alternative definitions were conducted in the same manner, using local
 health center estimates of eligible population or treatment coverage capped at 100%. An addi-
 tional sensitivity analysis used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the eligible popula-
 tion distributions in the two arms. As the P-value from this test was > 0.05, we assumed the
 samples were drawn from the same distribution and proceeded with a comparison of the clus-
 ter-level mean number of children treated by arm using permutation as defined for the pri-
 mary analysis. This allowed for a comparison of children treated without the uncertainty
 inherent in the denominator. Sensitivity analyses were conducted comparing the community-
 level median for each outcome using permutation as well. Treatment coverage for all sub-
 groups were summarized descriptively and community-level subgroups were analyzed using
 linear regression models with log-transformed number of children treated as the outcome,
 indicators for treatment arm and subgroup, log-transformed number of eligible children as
 covariate, and an interaction term between arm and subgroup. Overall costs were summarized
 as total costs per arm divided by total doses delivered by arm. Analyses of survey outcomes
 and alternative cost outcomes were conducted similarly to the coverage analyses. Analyses
 were conducted in R version 4.2.2.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> In November 2020, 1,915 communities in the Dosso region were assessed for eligibility for the
 main trial (Fig 1). Of these, 429 did not meet eligibility, 1,406 were randomly assigned to and
 enrolled in other studies, and 80 were included in the present trial and randomized to receive
 door-to-door or fixed-point delivery of azithromycin. After randomization, 1 community was

<section> estimates from CSIs, the mean number of children per community was 187 (standard devia-
 tion [SD] 149) in the door-to-door arm and 184 (SD 112) in the fixed-point arm. The esti-
 mated eligible population varied by data source (study census or administrative estimates) but
 was similar overall by arm (S1 Appendix).
 Table 1 summarizes characteristics of included communities and their CHWs before distri-
 butions began. Overall, the mean distance to the nearest CSI was 8.4 km (SD 9.0). Most CHWs
 were male (79.3%) with an average age of 36.9 years (SD 11.4). CHWs had an average of 3.9
 years of experience in the role (SD 4.4). No statistically significant differences in baseline char-
 acteristics were demonstrated between arms.
 The median number of days between the second distribution and the post-distribution cen-
 sus was 5 (inter-quartile range 3 to 7 days) overall and was similar by arm. Community-level
 mean treatment coverage at the second distribution was 105% (SD 44%) in the door-to-door
 arm and 92% (SD 20%) in the fixed-point arm (Table 2; Mean difference 13%, 95% CI -2% to
 
<section> 28%, permutation P-value = 0.08). Median treatment coverage was 94% in each arm (Table
 95% CI 83–103% in door-to-door and 78–104% in fixed point, P-value 0.38). Sensitivity analy-
 ses using other alternative outcome definitions were also unable to detect a difference in cover-
 age by arm (Table 2). The distribution of treatment coverage was similar in both arms, with
 the exception that the door-to-door approach resulted in more communities reporting a

 Two serious adverse events in the fixed-point arm were reported to the study team during
 the second distribution. Both children experienced diarrhea and vomiting 24–48 hours after
 azithromycin administration. Both were admitted to the CSI with dehydration and treated
 with metoclopramide, oral rehydration solution, and zinc and were released the same day as
 symptoms subsided. In the first round of distribution, one fixed point grappe did not receive
 distributions as part of this study due to outdated census information but the eligible popula-
 tion did receive distributions in the second round as anticipated.
 Estimates of the overall costs associated with each delivery modality are shown in Table 3.
 In both arms, the first distribution incurred greater costs associated with both training and
 delivery than the second distribution. At the second distribution, 6,144 doses were delivered
 the door-to-door arm and 4,781 doses were delivered in the fixed-point arm, resulting in a

 When including training costs, the total cost per dose delivered at the second distribution was
 $1.91 in the door-to-door arm and $2.51 in the fixed-point arm. Community-level costs are
 presented in S1 Appendix, as well as a sensitivity analysis evaluating costs under the scenario
 where CHWs are provided a standard payment regardless of days actually worked.

 preferred, the majority of caregivers and community leaders in both arms preferred the door-
 to-door approach (90–93% in the door-to-door arm and 72–76% in the fixed-point arm pre-
 ferred door-to-door; S1 Appendix), with reasons including that the approach ensures more
 children are treated and requires less personal travel for the caregivers. While the majority of
 CHWs in the door-to-door arm also preferred the door-to-door approach for the sake of the
 intervention’s goals, 49% of those in the fixed-point arm preferred fixed-point, in part because
 this modality simplifies the administration for the distributors (S1 Appendix). The majority
 caregivers and community leaders indicated knowledge of the timing and purpose of the dis-
 tribution, suggesting fidelity of the publicity effort to the protocol (S1 Appendix). Supervision
 visits indicated that most CHWs were administering azithromycin according to the protocol
 in both arms, with mean cluster-level adherence of more than 80% for each component
 (S1 Appendix). Although most caregivers in both arms reported participating in the distribu-
 tion if they had an eligible child, a greater proportion of caregivers who did not participate said
 they were unaware of the intervention in the fixed-point arm compared to the door-to-door
 arm (10.0% vs 1.1%; S1 Appendix).

<section> Discussion
 
<section> This cluster-randomized trial aimed to compare the implementation of door-to-door and
 fixed-point delivery of azithromycin distribution to increase child survival across a number
 indicators, including treatment coverage (reach), costs, acceptability, appropriateness, and
 fidelity. Overall, treatment coverage was high for both approaches, with average cluster-level
 coverage reaching more than 80% in both arms and distribution rounds. Other operational
 studies of community mass drug administration delivery have found similarly high levels of
 coverage on average, though the range of coverage achieved can be quite wide [15–17].
 Although an underlying goal of this study was to more closely mimic programmatic imple-
 mentation, the presence of the study team for training and supervision may have contributed
 to the high coverage across most communities in this setting. We were unable to detect a dif-
 ference in treatment coverage by arm given the degree of heterogeneity. Results suggested the
 possibility that door-to-door may result in a greater number of children treated, and more
 door-to-door communities reported treatment coverage > 100% than fixed-point

<section> communities, perhaps because this approach is able to include harder-to-reach households
 than fixed-point or even the census alone when not coupled with treatment. As anticipated,
 indicators of acceptability, appropriateness and fidelity of implementation were similar in
 both arms. Most caregivers and community leaders indicated a preference for the door-to- 
<section> door approach, stating that this delivery modality is better able to reach all children and
 reduces the burden on caregivers.
 The estimated overall costs across rounds were similar for the door-to-door and fixed-point
 delivery modalities given the similar overhead costs associated with each program and the pre-
 determined goal for distribution days per community. More doses were delivered in the door-
 to-door arm, however, resulting in lower costs per dose delivered. Studies of seasonal malaria
 chemoprevention have also suggested lower costs per dose delivered with the door-to-door
 approach [16, 18]. A systematic review of costs for mass drug administration in neglected trop-
 ical disease programs estimated costs to be less than $0.50 per dose delivered in 2015 for pro-
 grams treating 100,000 people or more, but over $2.00 per dose for programs treating fewer
 than 10,000 people [19]. These costs primarily reflect programs that rely on local or school-
 based volunteers, which was not the case for our program which paid existing CHWs. Unit
 costs are also expected to decrease as the number of years of implementation increase [19].
 Therefore, we anticipate that unit costs would decrease if all communities within eligible CSIs
 were treated over more rounds of distribution, and indeed we did see costs decrease between
 rounds in both arms, suggesting some improved efficiency with experience. Costs anticipated
 in a national scale-up of the program will be explored in future work. In addition, this program
 treated children 1–59 months of age but future programs may target children 1–11 months of
 age instead as recommended in the WHO guidelines [7]. The cost implications of this change
 in program target are currently being studied.
 The strengths of this study include the cluster-randomized design, use of an implementa-
 tion science framework to guide the development of outcome measurement, and the experi-
 enced study team and CHWs. Limitations include the challenge of population estimation and
 the gap between the distribution and census which resulted in inconsistencies between esti-
 mated number of children treated compared to the estimated number of children eligible. This
 resulted in estimates of treatment coverage of greater than 100%, which is common for similar
 programs.[15, 20] Typically, such programs use administrative estimates of coverage based on
 existing population estimates which can be unreliable [15, 20–24]. Despite conducting a sepa-
 rate population-based census to estimate the current eligible population, we still found incon-
 sistencies in population estimates. Some mass drug administration programs using
 administrative coverage will also independently validate coverage estimates through post-dis-
 tribution surveys of self-reported uptake [24, 25]. Our post-distribution survey indicated high
 coverage of > 90% in both arms, consistent with the primary analysis. In addition, it is also
 possible that neighboring communities learned of the distribution and brought their children
 for treatment despite not residing in the community, that children outside of the eligible age
 range were treated, and that residents were not at home during the census and so not counted
 in the denominator. Study team members and CHWs were trained to confirm residence in an
 attempt to reduce this possibility, but this process may not have completely eliminated the
 phenomenon. We attempted to address this challenge with sensitivity analyses, which pro-
 duced similar results to the primary analysis. However, we found a greater variance in treat-
 ment coverage in this programmatic approach to delivery than anticipated based on prior
 studies and so the trial was underpowered to detect small effects, especially among subgroups.
 In addition, several domains of interest were estimated using subjective indicators collected
 through surveys. Although these were developed in close collaboration with Nigerien study
 team members to ensure cultural appropriateness and comprehensibility, these responses are
 subject to social desirability bias and may not fully reflect the spectrum of preferences. We
 anticipate these results are generalizable to similar settings in Niger targeted by mass drug
 administration programs and perhaps similar West African countries. 
<section> Conclusions
 
<section> Overall, we found similar treatment coverage, acceptability, appropriateness and fidelity of
 implementation of the door-to-door and fixed-point approaches to azithromycin distribution
 for child survival. Our results suggested door-to-door might enable greater numbers of chil-
 dren to be treated and lower the cost per dose delivered. Given this result along with the stake-
 holder preference for the door-to-door modality, door-to-door delivery may be the optimal
 approach to azithromycin distribution in this setting.
