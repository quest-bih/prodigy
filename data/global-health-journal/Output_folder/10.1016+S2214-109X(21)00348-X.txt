<section> and side-effects. Trabeculectomy, the main surgical
 procedure for treating glaucoma, can effectively reduce
 IOP; however, the operation has a long learning curve, is
 offered in relatively few eye units across sub-Saharan
 Africa, can have clinically significant complications, and
 has a low uptake in some populations. 8–12 Selective laser
 trabeculoplasty (SLT) is a rapid outpatient procedure
 used to reduce IOP. SLT increases aqueous fluid outflow
 from the eye, which drains through the trabecular
 meshwork. There is increasing evidence supporting its
 use as a primary intervention. 13,14 Lasers, especially SLT,
 could be part of future treatment for glaucoma in sub-
 Saharan Africa. 15 However, to date, there have been no
 published trials of SLT in sub-Saharan Africa, and no
 trials worldwide have compared SLT with timolol as the
 standard treatment option.
 We aimed to investigate whether SLT was superior to
 timolol eye drops for controlling IOP in patients with
 open-angle glaucoma in a Tanzanian setting.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> We did a two-arm, parallel-group, single-masked
 randomised controlled trial at the Eye Department of
 region. By contrast, most patients in the previous trials involving
 SLT and more expensive eye drops had early or moderate
 glaucoma. Both eyes were enrolled if eligible and analysed using
 statistical methods that considered the correlation between the
 two eyes of a participant. This methodology efficiently used all
 available data, saving time and resources, and making optimal
 use of participants’ engagement. 12 months after
 randomisation, the estimated odds for success using SLT were
 3·37 times higher than those for success using 0·5% timolol eye
 drops. The odds ratio was not modified by other factors. Mean
 IOP reduction was 1·5 mm Hg (SD 7·5) in the timolol group and
 6·3 mm Hg (6·4) in the SLT group between the baseline visit and
 visits at failure, success at 1 year, or before loss to follow-up.
 Safety, acceptance, vision-related quality of life, and preservation
 of visual acuity were similar in both groups after 1 year. Eye care
 units in the region would need to treat around 500 eyes per year
 with SLT to cover the cost of the procedure, which would cost an
 amount similar to a 1-year supply of timolol eye drops.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 This trial adds to the existing evidence that SLT is an important
 addition to the treatment options for glaucoma, and extends
 this evidence to regions where advanced glaucoma is more
 common and treatment resources and options are limited.
 The prevalence of glaucoma is expected to increase in the
 coming decades due to increasing life expectancy and population
 growth, especially in low-income and middle-income regions.
 Therefore, SLT could help to prevent vision loss and blindness
 from glaucoma in regions where its prevalence is highest.

 Follow-up assessments were scheduled at 2, 6, 9, and
 12 months. Masked examiners measured IOP on each
 follow-up visit following the same procedure as was used
 during baseline assessment. Additional safety visits were
 arranged if the supervising clinician considered this to
 be necessary. One IOP measurement of up to 2 mm Hg
 above target IOP was allowed on one of the follow-up
 visits without triggering a repeat intervention or being
 considered a treatment failure. If the IOP was more than
 2 mm Hg above target or up to 2 mm Hg above target for
 the second time, repeat SLT or counselling was provided.
 If the IOP exceeded the target on any subsequent
 occasion again, the eye was considered to have a
 treatment failure and exited from the trial, and the
 patient received additional treatment (including the
 intervention from the other intervention arm, additional
 eye drops, or trabeculectomy; appendix 4 p 4).
 Furthermore, if the IOP was more than 40 mm Hg at any
 visit, the eye was considered to have a treatment failure
 and was exited from the trial immediately; additional
 treatment was provided to the participant’s eye.
 To estimate the cost of an SLT laser procedure, we
 followed a bottom-up micro-costing approach assuming
 that the equipment had a lifetime of 10 years and that
 the SLT treatment was done on demand during a
 glaucoma clinic by an ophthalmologist earning a

 total costs for eight production scenarios, depending on
 the annual number of treatments (appendix 4 pp 10–12).
 The annual cost of timolol eye drops was identified
 using the median of three prices at pharmacies across
 Tanzania and was used as a reference to determine the
 number of SLT procedures that would result in
 comparable cost. Both annual treatment costs were then
 compared with an affordability threshold of 2·5% of
 Tanzania’s gross domestic product per capita, as a proxy
 of income.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome was the proportion of eyes
 from both intervention groups with treatment success at
 12 months following randomisation. For patients with
 advanced glaucoma (stage 8–10 according to the Disc
 Damage Likelihood Scale), this target IOP was
 18 mm Hg or below and for those with moderate
 glaucoma (stage 5–7), this target was 21 mm Hg or below.
 Secondary outcomes were safety, acceptance, vision-
 related quality of life, adherence, preservation of visual
 acuity and visual fields, other glaucoma-related functional
 or structural changes, other IOP-related outcomes,
 analyses of focus group discussions, cost, and treatment
 affordability.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 The trial was powered to test the hypothesis that SLT is
 superior to timolol eye drops. From the literature and
 retrospective data from the Eye Department at KCMC,
 we anticipated that the proportions of success after
 12 months would be 60% for timolol and 75% for SLT.
 Allowing for a loss to follow-up of 20%, a sample size of
 360 eyes was estimated to provide 80% power with
 95% confidence to detect such a difference.
 The primary outcome was a binary variable defined as
 treatment success at 12 months, compared between the
 two treatment arms. Analysis of the primary outcome
 was by modified intention-to-treat using a logistic
 regression model, in which participants lost to follow-up
 were excluded, with generalised estimating equations
 (GEE) to account for the absence of inde­ pendence
 between eyes, if both eyes were included. The primary
 analysis was unadjusted, although baseline characteristics
 were examined for balance between arms.
 Secondary outcomes were described and compared
 between the two treatment arms. A change in visual acuity
 of two or more lines on the logarithm of the minimum
 angle of resolution (logMAR) chart (equals ≥0·2 logMAR
 between baseline and the last visit, either in the event of a
 failure, before loss to follow-up, or success at 12 months)
 was defined as a loss of central vision and compared using
 logistic regression with GEE by arm. 28 Acceptance was
 described as the number of times a participant refused
 an intervention at any of the follow-up visits after
 being randomly assigned. WHO/PBD-VF20 items were

 possible vision-related quality of life score. 18 Affordability
 was described as whether a person had sufficient income
 to pay for health-care services, treatment, or costs
 (appendix 4 p 12).
 We tested for evidence of effect modification by the
 stage of glaucoma and baseline IOP. A sensitivity analysis
 was done to provide the most conservative estimate,
 considering all participants lost to follow-up as failure in
 the more successful arm and as success in the less
 successful arm. Patients lost to follow-up were compared
 Table 1: Baseline participant and ocular characteristics
 with those who completed the trial with respect to age,
 sex, stage of glaucoma, intervention, visual field defect,
 visual acuity, and travel details using logistic regression
 with GEE. Differences between arms in time to an event
 were assessed by plotting survival curves and a Cox
 regression analysis, by use of a shared frailty model to
 account for dependency between the two eyes. Other
 potential determinants of success were investigated
 using logistic regression with GEE. To prevent
 multicollinearity in a fully adjusted model, all potential
 determinants were first screened for inclusion using a
 univariable model and GEE. Any factor in which p<0·2
 was included in the fully adjusted model. Backward
 stepwise selection was then employed to find the most
 parsimonious logistic regression model, with p<0·05 for
 all predictors.
 Data were managed in a custom built database in
 Microsoft Access 2016. Stata (version 16.1) was used to
 compute the statistical analysis. A data safety monitoring
 board oversaw the study. This trial was registered
 with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number
 PACTR201508001235339.

<section> (Table 2 continues on next page)
 
<section> eligible partici­ pants (382 eyes) were enrolled between
 Aug 31, 2015, and May 12, 2017, of whom 100 (50%) of
 the participants (191 eyes) were randomly assigned to the
 timolol group and 101 (50%; 191 eyes) to the SLT group.
 All participants were members of one of the ethnic
 groups living in Tanzania (table 1). At 12 months,
 Eye 177 (88%) patients (339 eyes) were included in the
 analysis; 24 (12%) patients (43 eyes) had been lost to
 follow-up. The mean age of 201 people enrolled in the
 trial was 66·3 years (SD 11·6) and 83 participants were
 female. The mean age of 639 patients not enrolled was
 65·0 years (15·5) and 268 participants were female.
 Loss to follow-up was not associated with age, sex,
 stage of glaucoma, intervention arm, or level of visual
 acuity. There was evidence that patients with advanced
 visual field defects were less likely (p=0·0018) and
 patients who needed a guide for their journey to the eye
 hospital were more likely (p=0·016) to be lost to follow-
 up. However, these inferences are based on few patients
 who were lost to follow-up (24 patients [12%]; figure 1).
 A successful IOP reduction 1 year after the start of
 treatment was reported in 55 (31%) of 176 eyes in the
 timolol group (16 [29%] of 55 eyes required repeat
 counselling) and in 99 (61%) of 163 eyes in the SLT group
 (33 [33%] of 99 eyes required a repeat SLT). The
 unadjusted logistic regression model (ie, GEE) for the
 relationship between intervention and success estimated
 an odds ratio (OR) of SLT over timolol eye drops of 3·37
 (95% CI 1·96–5·80; p<0·0001; table 2). Cox regression
 analysis showed a hazard ratio of 0·16 (0·09–0·30;
 p<0·0001; figure 2). Detailed IOP results can be found in
 the appendix 4 (pp 5–6).
 A reduction of central vision occurred in 36 (19%) of
 187 eyes in the timolol group and in 40 (21%) of 188 in the
 SLT group. There was no evidence of a difference
 between interventions (OR 1·16 [95% CI 0·66–2·06];
 p=0·60). Vision-related quality of life measured with the
 WHO/PBD-VF20 showed no differences between the
 two groups (table 3).
 Self-reported adherence to eye drop use in the timolol
 group was high (table 4). 56–75% of patients reported
 daily application of eye drops during the 2 weeks before
 the follow-up visit, 15–24% of patients reported missing
 eye drops for 1–2 days, and only 4–20% of patients
 reported missing eye drops for more than 2 days. No
 participant refused either timolol eye drops or SLT within
 the first year, including repeat interventions.
 From an eye care provider’s perspective, the variable
 cost per SLT treatment was estimated to be US$2·57.
 Annual fixed costs were $4960, including the depreciation
 of the initial purchase over the 10 years, the annual
 inspection, and an assumption of two repairs. 13 Travel
 expenses of technicians were added, which might be
 substantial where services are not available in a country
 (appendix 4 pp 10–12). The SLT laser has been in
 operation at KCMC since 2015 without needing repair.
 With a scenario of 500 eyes treated per year, the total 
<insert> Table 2: Predicted ORs for success

 failure
 (%)
 in 2019 was reported to be $1122·12, so any annual
 treatment cost below $28·05 can be considered
 affordable. Thus, the annual treatment cost of timolol
 and SLT for one eye are below this threshold (assuming
 500 procedures per year in an eye health unit). For SLT,
 the treatment costs for two eyes can also be considered
 affordable for most patients as 66 (67%) of 99 eyes only
 required one treatment for a successful outcome (annual
 treatment cost for two eyes of $24·98).
 We used a sensitivity analysis to assess whether the
 primary outcome results were possibly influenced by
 loss to follow-up. The hypothetical scenario considered
 all patients who were lost to follow-up in the SLT group
 to be failures and those in the timolol group to be
 successes, assuming the worst possible scenario for the
 SLT group. The OR of success of SLT was 1·88 (95% CI
 1·13–3·11; p=0·015).
 There was no evidence of an effect modification in the
 OR of SLT over timolol by the stage of glaucoma (p=0·55)
 or by the baseline IOP (p=0·14; appendix 4 p 8).
 Other potential determinants for success were
 evaluated (table 2). The most parsimonious multivariable
 model showed an association between success and SLT
 (vs timolol) as the randomisation arm (OR 5·35 [95% CI
 2·77–10·31]; p<0·0001), high (vs low) IOP at baseline
 (0·33 [0·19–0·60]; p=0·0003), advanced (vs moderate)
 stage of glaucoma (0·11 [0·06–0·20]; p<0·0001), and the
 presence (vs absence) of exfoliation material (0·16
 [0·05–0·46]; p=0·0009).
 In total, there were ten (10%) ocular and systemic
 adverse events in the timolol group and eight (8%) in the
 SLT group (OR 0·77 [95% CI 0·29–2·05]; p=0·61;
 table 5). Four patients died during the 1-year follow-up
 period (one in the timolol group vs three in the SLT
 group) from known pre-existing general medical
 conditions. SLT was associated with several transient
 (<1 h) side-effects (appendix 4 p 9). The baseline SLT
 procedure caused no pain during 69 (36%) of
 baseline laser procedures, mild pain during 103 (54%),
 moderate pain during 15 (8%), and severe pain during

 greater reduction in IOP is more difficult to achieve in
 general; therefore, the probability of success is likely
 to be lower in eyes with advanced glaucoma and a
 higher baseline IOP (appendix 4 p 7) than in those
 with moderate glaucoma and a lower baseline IOP.
 Exfoliation glaucoma reduced the probability of success
 in both intervention groups. To date, few clinical trials
 with small sample sizes have shown inconclusive results
 concerning the role of exfoliation glaucoma. 32 Our results
 suggest that, although the subtype of exfoliation
 glaucoma is challenging to treat overall, SLT might still
 be a better option than timolol (appendix 4 p 7). Some
 regions in sub-Saharan Africa are affected by a
 particularly high prevalence of exfoliation glaucoma.
