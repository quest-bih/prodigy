<section> benefits, enhancing birth spacing and thus
 reducing maternal and neonatal mortality
 and morbidity. 2–4 There is also evidence of
 economic benefits in terms of higher earn-
 ings for women and enhanced educational
 outcomes for children. 5 Accordingly, high
 levels of unmet need in low- and middle-­
 income countries (LMICs) can have mean-
 ingful consequences for welfare. While access
 to family planning has been increasing,
 progress has been slow in some regions,
 particularly in sub-­Saharan Africa.
 Ensuring universal access to sexual and
 reproductive healthcare is identified as one
 of the Sustainable Development Goals, 7 and
 in Mozambique, the site of this evaluation,
 a commitment to the Family Planning 2020 
<section> global partnership was made in 2012 with the objective
 of accelerating progress towards family planning goals.
 Despite this commitment, unmet need remains high:
 national unmet need for modern family planning method
 in Mozambique was estimated as 23% in 2015. 9 Among
 adolescent girls aged 15–19, a total of 46% are pregnant
 for the first time or already have one child, and in this
 group, only 14% are using any contraception method.
 Given these persistent challenges around access to
 contraception, researchers and policymakers have
 identified potential barriers informed by behavioural
 science for women who have unmet need for family plan-
 ning or have not accessed their preferred method. For
 example, limited attention and present bias may prevent
 women from taking short-­term steps to use a contracep-
 tion method despite their long-­ term family planning
 goals. ‘Nudges’ designed to address these barriers have
 potential to be integrated into family planning policies
 and programming. The evidence around the effects of
 nudges on health-­related outcomes is substantial 10 11 but
 derived primarily from high-­income countries, and there
 is relatively limited literature from LMICs.
 More specifically, one popular nudge is reminders or
 other information delivered by text message or mobile
 phone applications. Existing reviews of mobile health
 (mHealth) interventions in LMICS have noted there
 is no consistent evidence that these interventions lead
 to behaviour change, 12 and highlighted that many
 published papers do not provide any evidence on health
 outcomes. 13–15 In family planning specifically, a number
 of published studies evaluate the effects of short message
 service (SMS) or rapid message interventions, but report
 only effects on variables such as contraceptive knowledge
 or attitudes. These evaluations do not measure or do not
 find any evidence of shifts in behaviours such as contra-
 ceptive use. 16–20 Accordingly, a broader evidence base is
 needed.
 This paper reports on a randomised controlled trial
 conducted in the context of a large community health
 worker programme in urban and periurban Mozambique
 led by Population Services International (PSI). A series
 of text message reminders was designed to encourage
 women who had received a referral from a community
 health worker to visit a health clinic for a family plan-
 ning consultation. The objective of the trial was to eval-
 uate the effect of these text reminders on the probability
 of a clinic visit as well as the probability of contraceptive
 uptake.
 
<section> METHODS
 Trial design and participants
 This two-­arm, parallel randomised controlled trial was
 conducted between January 2020 and January 2021 in
 urban and periurban areas of two provinces in Mozam-
 bique, Nampula (including Nampula city, Angoche,
 Ilha de Mocambique, Murrupula and Nacala Porto) and
 Sofala (including Beira and Dondo). The trial was jointly
 conducted by PSI and researchers based at the Office of
 Evaluation Sciences in the US General Services Admin-
 istration and the International Food Policy Research
 Institute. The trial protocol and Consolidated Standards
 of Reporting Trials checklist are available as supporting
 information (online supplemental material S1, S2).
 The target sample for the study was women of repro-
 ductive age served by community health workers in the
 Integrated Family Planning Program (IFPP). PSI deliv-
 ered IFPP services in the provinces of interest, deploying
 community health workers (known as promoters) who
 offered women information about family planning
 in visits to homes or neighbourhoods in their service
 area. Visits focused on providing information about
 family planning and addressing common myths, and
 did not entail the direct provision of any family plan-
 ning methods; rather, promoters provided women who
 voluntarily expressed demand for family planning with
 referrals to public health facilities, where family planning
 counselling from a nurse and contraceptive methods
 are available at no cost. Promoters also conducted up to
 three follow-­up visits with women as needed, to provide
 more information or address concerns about side effects
 of a method obtained. PSI recruited around 100—120
 promoters in the target regions, organised into teams of
 around five promoters each working with a single super-
 visor. Promoters conducted around 13–15 visits per day
 on average and were compensated per visit conducted
 and for each woman referred who visited a clinic.
 In addition, promoters recorded information about
 each visit and the woman who participated in PSI’s
 mobile application, Connecting with Sarah (CwS). PSI
 and public nurses in local health clinics used the same
 mobile application to record when women presented a
 referral for family planning counselling, and to record if
 a contraceptive method was provided.
 The following eligibility criteria were specified for
 enrolment in the trial. Women 18 or older were eligible
 if they were visited by a promoter and received a referral
 to a health facility for further services, provided a phone
 number, and provided written consent for inclusion in
 the evaluation. Enrolment commenced on 20 January
 2020 and was suspended on 4 April 2020 due to the state
 of emergency (SOE) declared in Mozambique as a result
 of the COVID-­19 pandemic. Enrolment then resumed
 on 1 October 2020, concluding on 18 December 2020.
 The target sample size was specified to be 5000 women
 enrolled; given this sample size, the trial could detect an
 increase in the probability of a clinic visit of 4 percentage
 points. The trial ultimately closed following a shorter
 enrolment period due to COVID-­19 disruptions, and the
 timing of enrolment closure was dictated by the timeline
 for broader programme conclusion.
 The two provinces included in this evaluation, Nampula
 and Sofala, are highlighted in figure 1. Demographic
 data from the 2015 AIDS Indicator Survey conducted by
 the Demographic and Health Surveys programme can be
 used to characterise the sample. In Sofala, 26% of urban

 adults surveyed report no education and 43% report
 primary education, while in Nampula, the corresponding
 figures are 36% and 41%. Nationwide in Mozambique,
 35% of urban adults report no education, and 48% report
 primary education. Socioeconomic indicators are gener-
 ally higher in Sofala, where 82% of urban adult residents
 surveyed report access to electricity, and around 70%
 report their residences have cement walls and cement
 floors; in Nampula, 64% of urban adults report access
 to electricity at home; 46% have cement floors; and 35%
 have cement walls. Nationwide in Mozambique, 38%
 report access to electricity; 40% have cement floors; and
 30% have cement walls.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 Eligible women enrolled in the evaluation had their
 consent forms verified by trial staff, and the sample was
 then aggregated across the two study provinces. Women
 were randomly assigned to the treatment or control arm
 using the phone number provided on their consent
 form. Randomisation was conducted at least twice weekly
 by PSI staff in Maputo in Stata V.14 using a reproducible
 seed, employing stratification at the level of the promoter
 supervisor. On average, randomisation was conducted
 days following the provision of consent. (Given that only
 two provinces are included in the evaluation, randomisa-
 tion at the province level was infeasible.)
 The intended allocation ratio of participants to the
 treatment and control arm was 1:1. When the study was
 launched, the randomisation code had an unintentional
 error that slightly increased the probability of assigning
 women to treatment: if the number of women in a partic-
 ular strata (defined by supervisor identity on a given
 randomisation day) was odd, the final observation was
 uniformly assigned to treatment. (The identity of the
 final observation was, however, determined randomly
 via assignment of random numbers.) This error was
 corrected as of 28 February 2020.
 Given the nature of the intervention, it was not possible
 to mask participants assigned to the treatment arm to
 their assignment. However, participants assigned to the
 control arm may have been blind to their assignment.
 Promoters and health staff at the health facilities were
 blind to study group assignment.
 
<section> Intervention design
 The intervention of interest was a series of short text
 message reminders designed to encourage take-­ up of
 health facility visits for family planning counselling by
 women who had been provided referrals by promoters.
 The messages were developed by the research and imple-
 mentation teams with the objective of providing women
 with targeted, brief reminders about the importance
 of family planning; the opportunity to visit the health
 facility; and the opportunity to follow-­ up with their
 promoter, as needed. The text of the reminders can
 be found in table 1 in English; in the trial, all messages
 were in Portuguese. To maintain an appropriate level of
 confidentiality, the messages refer to family planning but
 also use more general terms such as health, hospital and
 promoter.
 Table 1 also describes message timing as follows: on
 the same day as randomisation, women assigned to the
 treatment arm were registered by the vendor (SISLOG)
 who was responsible for delivering the text messages.
 Message timing is defined relative to this registration
 date. (On average, the time elapsed between the date
 of promoter visit and the randomisation and the regis-
 tration date was 5 days, the time required to verify and
 aggregate the sample of women providing consent across
 all promoters.) Messages were sent on the first and fourth
 days following registration, and then 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks
 following the first message.
 Women who received the messages were of course free
 to share information received with members of their
 social networks, and this may have included women
 who were enrolled in the evaluation and assigned to the
 control arm. Any such communication between treat-
 ment and control beneficiaries would serve to reduce the
 magnitude of the estimated treatment effect.

<section> Data and outcomes
 The data employed in this analysis were collected via a
 mobile application, CwS, used by promoters and health
 facility nurses. Following each promoter visit, promoters
 used a PSI-­provided smartphone to access the CwS plat-
 form and recorded information about the beneficiary
 (age; current contraceptive use, if any; and access to a
 mobile phone), and whether a referral was issued. The
 data were uploaded at the conclusion of the visit and
 were automatically stamped with the date, time and
 global positioning system (GPS) coordinates. Similarly,
 nurses or health staff at referring facilities used CwS to
 record visits from women who visit for family planning
 services with a referral, and the two records were linked
 by a referral number. These facility records were also
 time-­stamped and include information about the type
 of contraceptive method provided (counselling only,
 contraceptive pill, Depo-­Provera, Sayana Press, contra-
 ceptive implant, intrauterine implant or other).
 The analysis includes data from 20 January 2020, the
 day on which enrolment was launched, until 31 January
 2021, 6 weeks following the last enrolment. Between
 April and 1 October 2020, enrolment in the evaluation
 was paused, but we still observe data from clinics in this
 period and are thus able to identify if women who were
 already enrolled in the evaluation visited a clinic. Our
 data do not include any records of women’s receipt of
 contraceptive methods in locations other than public
 clinics (ie, pharmacies or private clinics). Also, should a
 woman visit a public clinic and fail to provide her referral
 information, she could still receive family planning
 services at no cost, but this visit would not be recorded
 in the CwS application and thus would not be visible in
 our data. Data from the 2003 Demographic and Health
 Survey (not reported in more recent survey rounds)
 suggest that among women reporting use of modern
 contraceptives, less than 5% report receipt from a private
 clinic, nurse or pharmacy, suggesting that our data
 presumably include the majority of contraceptive receipt
 for this population.

<section> outcomes of interest include a binary variable for contra-
 ceptive uptake at the clinic and a continuous variable
 capturing the number of days between the promoter visit
 and the woman’s visit to the clinic, conditional on the
 observation of a clinic visit. There were no changes to
 the primary outcomes following the commencement of
 the trial.
 For the variables corresponding with clinic visit and
 contraceptive uptake, these variables are coded as one if
 any facility activity is recorded on any day following the
 woman’s promoter visit. Within a given randomisation
 stratum, all women included were randomised into the
 sample on the same day and visited by promoters within
 the same approximately 3-­day period; accordingly, within
 a randomisation strata, all are observed in the sample
 for approximately the same period of time. There is,
 however, variation across strata in how long women were
 observed in the sample: women enrolled in the evaluation
 in the first month were observed for roughly 10 months,
 while women enrolled in the final month were observed
 for 1 month. The inclusion of binary variables for strata
 in the primary specification will adjust for this variation
 across strata in the observable period. In addition, as a
 robustness check, we define an additional variable equal
 to clinic visit within 30 days, coded as one for all observa-
 tions in which the respondent is observed visiting a clinic
 within this time period.
 The analysis also draws on administrative data from
 SISLOG, a local text message vendor, allowing us to
 report whether text messages were recorded as deliv-
 ered or undelivered because the number was out of
 service. (However, one of the three cell service compa-
 nies in Mozambique did not provide this information to
 SISLOG, and messages sent to customers of this company
 would never be recorded as ‘delivered’; accordingly, the
 estimated delivery rate can be considered to be a lower
 bound.) We are not able to access any data reporting
 whether a message was read.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 The methods used in the statistical analysis were prespec-
 ified in a registered analysis plan. 23 We estimate risk 
<section> differences between the treatment and the control arms
 using ordinary least squares in an intent-­to-­treat frame-
 work. We use a linear model for ease of interpretation
 and cluster the SEs with respect to the day of randomisa-
 tion to account for potential correlation in the error term
 for women who were visited by promoters and referred
 to clinics in the same period. 25 We prespecified the esti-
 mation of a model that adjusted for randomisation strata
 (the interaction of randomisation day and a binary vari-
 able for supervisor), age, province and distance to the
 nearest health facility. Distance is estimated as the linear
 distance employing the GPS coordinates associated with
 the promoter visit conducted at home and the coordi-
 nate of the closest health facility, and included as a series
 of binary variables capturing deciles of distance to allow
 for non-­linear effects.
 The analysis plan also prespecified analysis of hetero-
 geneity along a number of dimensions: beneficiary age,
 contraceptive use at first meeting with the promoter, sole
 ownership of phone, time elapsed between promoter visit
 and randomisation, and distance to clinic. Following the
 suspension of enrolment due to the COVID-­19-­related
 SOE, the analysis plan was also updated to specify the
 separate analysis of treatment effects in the pre-­SOE and
 post-­SOE period.
 In addition, we estimate a treatment on the treated
 effect in a two-­stage least squares specification. In this
 model, the independent variable is a binary variable
 equal to 1 if the phone number reports receipt of all
 eight reminder messages and 0 otherwise (and zero for
 all phone numbers assigned to the control arm), and we
 instrument for this variable with treatment assignment.
 The model adjusts for the same covariates described in
 the ITT model, and standard errors are again clustered
 with respect to the day of the randomisation. This anal-
 ysis was also prespecified.
 In some cases, the same phone number was enrolled in
 the evaluation more than once, or the same number was
 enrolled and randomised once but was observed multiple
 times in promoter data. This duplication could be accu-
 rate (multiple women use the same phone) or could be
 recorded in error. There are 201 cases in which a phone
 number was enrolled more than once, and 531 cases in
 which the phone number was observed more than once
 in outcome data; there are 598 phone numbers charac-
 terised by at least one form of duplication. Given this
 pattern, all the variables in the primary specification are
 converted to phone number-­level means: the dependent
 variable (a binary variable for a clinic visit), the indepen-
 dent variable capturing treatment assignment and all
 covariates. The same procedure was used when a phone
 number that was uniquely enrolled via the consent forms
 matches to multiple observations of that number in the
 CwS database, indicating the number was recorded for
 separate visits to different women. Due to this procedure,
 there is some continuous variation in both the treatment
 and the dependent variables between 0 and 1, corre-
 sponding to phone numbers that were partially treated:
 some women who enrolled using this number were
 assigned to treatment, and some women were assigned
 to control. For example, if a phone number was enrolled
 twice (listed on two separate consent forms) and was
 randomised once to treatment and one to control, treat-
 ment status for this phone number would be coded as
 0.5.
 Intervention costs were also tracked and analysed as
 part of this trial using a provider perspective. This cost
 estimate includes the full cost of the contract with the
 vendor who provided text message services, and an esti-
 mate of staff and administrative costs required to design
 and implement the intervention.
 
<section> Role of the funding source
 The funders of the study (United States Agency for Inter-
 national Development) had no role in study design,
 data collection, analysis, interpretation or writing of the
 results. The corresponding author (JL) had full access to
 all data in the study and the final responsibility for the
 decision to submit for publication.
 
<section> Patient and public involvement
 During the design phase of this trial, interviews of women
 served by IFPP as well as focus groups of promoters,
 supervisors and PSI staff were convened in order to
 provide feedback about the challenges faced by women
 in accessing contraception, and by promoters in serving
 them. In addition, PSI staff shared sample messages
 with programme beneficiaries in focus groups to ensure
 clarity and relevance of the text messages and made
 adjustments based on participant feedback. An author
 reflexivity statement is attached (online supplemental
 material S3).
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Figure 2 depicts the trial profile. During the period of
 enrolment, 110 200 women were visited by PSI promoters
 and assessed for eligibility; 41 642 women received refer-
 rals to health facilities. This sample receiving referrals was
 screened for inclusion in the trial, and 13 586 women met
 the primary criteria (provided a mobile phone number).
 A total of 5370 women provided written consent and
 were enrolled in the evaluation. There was some dupli-
 cation of phone numbers across enrolled women; some
 women were registered by the text message vendor using
 the same phone number, either accurately (because
 two women in the sample share a number) or in error.
 Accordingly, 5169 unique phone numbers were enrolled:
 there were 170 numbers that were registered twice,
 numbers that were registered three times and 1 number
 that was registered four times. Within the sample, 2728
 enrolled women were randomly assigned to treatment,
 and 2642 enrolled women were randomised to control.
 The phone numbers recorded on consent forms were
 matched to the phone numbers available in the CwS
 database. Only 3623 enrolled women could be matched
 with an administrative record of their promoter and (if

<section> applicable) clinic visits, corresponding to 3468 unique
 phone numbers. This results in 1747 women with
 written consent who were lost to follow-­up or 32.5% of
 the sample: 906 or 33.2% assigned to the treatment arm
 and 841 or 31.8% assigned to the control arm, a differ-
 ence that is not statistically significant (p=0.281). Women
 who were lost to follow-­up are missing outcome data and
 summary data on covariates, as all CwS data are linked to
 the phone number.
 We present characteristics of the study sample in
 table 2 for the full sample and the sample enrolled both
 pre-­SOE and post-­SOE. We also report summary statistics
 for the sample observed in treatment and control arms.
 The average age of women enrolled in the sample is 25.7
 years. Distance to facility is low on average (less than
 four kilometres), though this is higher pre-­SOE (5.02
 kilometers) than post-­ SOE (2.63 kilometers). Within
 the sample, 69.6% report they are the sole owner of the
 phone number they have provided. Among the women,
 30.9% report they are currently using contraception on
 their first interaction with the promoter, and this proba-
 bility is dramatically higher pre-­SOE (44.0%) compared
 with post-­SOE (20.9%). We also report the p value corre-
 sponding to a χ 2 test of the joint hypothesis that these
 covariates are balanced across treatment and control
 arms; this hypothesis cannot be rejected (p=0.903).
 Considering the outcome variables of interest, the
 probability of a clinic visit following a referral is around
 48% on average, slightly lower pre-­ SOE (43.7%)
 compared with post-­SOE (51.3%). The probability of a
 clinic visit within a month of the promoter’s visit is 44.7%.

 This table reports summary statistics for the full sample for the sample enrolled in the pre-­COVID and post-­COVID state of emergency period; and
 for the sample assigned to the treatment and control arms. The labels indicate whether the variable of interest is continuous (for which the mean and
 the number of observations is reported) or binary (for which the mean and the number of observations is reported). For the purposes of the table,
 any phone number that is enrolled multiple times and partially treated is included as part of the treatment arm.

 (without any time limit) is 46.9%. Around 11 days elapse
 on average between the promoter visit and the woman’s
 visit to a clinic (median days elapsed is eight). In analysing
 summary statistics for numbers assigned to treatment and
 control, there is little evidence of any meaningful differ-
 ences across the two arms.
 Data from the text message vendor on intervention
 implementation are also reported. On average, phone
 numbers assigned to the treatment arm reported receipt
 of 79.4% of text messages, though as noted earlier this
 may reflect a lower bound due to missing information
 from one cell service company. Of the enrolled phone
 numbers, 62.1% reported receipt of all eight text
 messages.
 Table 3 presents the primary results analysing the effect of
 the intervention on clinic visits and contraceptive take-­up.
 In the intent-­to-­treat analysis, the estimated effect of the text
 reminders on the probability of a clinic visit is positive and
 marginally statistically significant at the 10% level: women
 who received text reminders were 2.3 percentage points
 (95% CI −0.003% to 0.048%, p=0.081) more likely to visit
 a clinic for family planning services, relative to a probability
 of 47.4% in the control arm. This is a proportional effect
 of 4.9%. The effect is larger (3.2 percentage points, or a
 proportional effect of 6.8%) and statistically significant at the
 5% level in the pre-­SOE period (95% CI 0.001% to 0.063%,
 p=0.042) and the same magnitude but noisily estimated in
 the post-­SOE period (95% CI −0.017% to 0.064%, p=0.254).
 As a robustness check, we also estimate the effect of the
 reminder on a clinic visit within 1 month and here observe
 an effect that is larger vis-à-vis the main treatment estimate
 (3.7 percentage points) and statistically significant at the 1%
 level in the full sample (95% CI 0.012% to 0.062%, p=0.004).
 We also report the estimated treatment effects for the two
 additional secondary variables of interest. For the proba-
 bility of receiving a contraceptive method at a clinic, the esti-
 mated effect of the text reminders is positive (2.3 percentage
 points) and statistically significant at the 10% level (95% CI
 −0.004% to 0.048%, p=0.091) though again significant at the
 5% level when restricted to the pre-­SOE period. For the time
 elapsed between promoter visit and clinic visit (conditional
 on observing a clinic visit), we observe a negative coefficient
 of −1.219 that is statistically significant at the 1% level (95%
 CI −2.133% to –0.306%, p=0.009).
 Table 4 presents the two-­stage least squares analysis.
 The estimated effect of receiving all reminder messages
 is now larger (3.6 percentage points, 95% CI −0.005%
 to 0.076%, p=0.083) or a proportional effect of 7.6%.
 There is a 5.8 percentage point increase in the proba-
 bility of a clinic visit within a month (95% CI 0.019% to
 0.098%, p=0.004) and a 3.5 percentage point increase in
 the probability of contraceptive receipt (95% CI −0.006%
 to 0.077%, p=0.092). Redemption time is around 2 days
 shorter on average (95% CI −3.478 to –0.507, p=0.009).

 This table reports estimated risk differences corresponding to the effect of assignment to the text message treatment for the full sample, the
 sample enrolled pre-­SOE and the sample enrolled post-­SOE. For phone numbers that were enrolled more than once, we identify the phone
 number as pre-­SOE if at least one enrolment was recorded pre-­SOE. Eight phone numbers are missing data for method choice that would
 allow us to identify contraceptive receipt. Days between promoter visit and clinic visit are coded as missing for women who never reported a
 clinic visit. Each cell reports the coefficient and 95% CI, and p value and the number of observations.

 This table reports estimated risk differences corresponding to
 the effect of receipt of a full set of eight text messages for the full
 sample, using a two-­stage least squares analysis in which receipt
 of text messages is instrumented by treatment assignment. Eight
 phone numbers are missing data for method choice that would
 allow us to identify contraceptive receipt. Days between promoter
 visit and clinic visit are coded as missing for women who never
 reported a clinic visit. Each cell reports the coefficient and 95% CI,
 and p value and the number of observations.

 Table 5 presents the results by subsamples. The positive
 treatment effect is observed to be larger (4.1 percentage
 points) for women under the age of 25 (95% CI −0.001
 to 0.083, p=0.055). By contrast, the estimated effect for
 women over the age of 25 is in fact negative, though
 statistically insignificant. There is no evidence of any
 meaningful heterogeneity in response with respect to
 whether the woman reports she is currently using contra-
 ception on meeting the promoter, whether she reports
 she is the sole owner of the phone registered, the time
 elapsed between the promoter visit and the date on
 which the woman enters the randomisation sample, or
 distance to the health facility.
 Cost data for the intervention suggests a total cost of
 $7593.87 for the implementation of the text reminders,
 excluding the costs of the evaluation itself. Given the
 number of women targeted by the intervention (enrolled
 in the treatment arm and successfully reached by at least
 one text reminder), the cost per woman targeted is $2.74.
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> The evidence presented here from a randomised
 trial of text reminders suggests that this intervention
 can be an effective strategy to increase facility visits by
 women referred for family planning services in urban
 and periurban Mozambique. The effect of the text
 reminders is positive and statistically significant: women
 who received text reminders are more likely to visit a
 clinic, are more likely to report receiving a contracep-
 tive method at a clinic and visit the clinic more rapidly
 (conditional on ever reporting a visit). Moreover, the
 effects are particularly large for younger women and
 prior to the COVID-­19-­related SOE. In addition, the fact
 that the effect on contraceptive use is also positive indi-
 cates that the marginal woman encouraged to visit the

<section> This
 of
 
<section> clinic by a reminder message does in fact take up contra-
 ception, rather than visiting and ultimately choosing not
 to use any contraceptive method.
 This paper joins a limited literature to date analysing
 the effects of mHealth interventions and nudges
 informed by behavioural science on primary healthcare
 use, including use of sexual and reproductive healthcare,
 in LMICs. Only two previous papers to our knowledge
 have analysed the effects of a nudge on family planning
 uptake. One evaluation conducted in urban Kenya found
 that there was no incremental effect of text message
 reminders for women offered vouchers to receive family
 planning at no cost at a private clinic. 26 A second evalua-
 tion conducted in rural Kenya found a statistically signifi-
 cant increase in contraceptive uptake among women who
 received a series of SMS messages postpartum providing
 information about danger signs and family planning; only
 women who recently delivered were enrolled into the
 intervention. 27 A third recent paper analysed an mHealth
 intervention designed to enhance contraceptive counsel-
 ling (a tablet-­based application) in Cameroon and found
 a very large positive effect on adoption of long-­acting
 contraceptives. 28 Other papers have analysed the effect of
 mHealth interventions on knowledge or attitudes around
 contraception only. 16–20
 In the broader area of reproductive health, a
 randomised trial conducted in South Africa found
 that daily reminder text messages following adult male
 circumcision increased attendance at postoperative
 clinic visits by 6 percentage points. 29 Another mHealth
 intervention—which consisted of messages two times per
 month and then two times per week, and also allowed
 for two-­ way communication with a health provider—
 rolled out to pregnant women attending primary health-
 care facilities in Zanzibar led to a 13 percentage point
 increase in the use of antenatal care 30 and an associ-
 ated reduction in perinatal mortality. 31 In general, the
 magnitude of the effect observed here (ranging from
 percentage points for the full sample to 4 percentage
 points for the sample under 25) seems plausible, given
 the existing evidence; it is approximately half the size
 of the effect observed for clinic visits following a non-­
 trivial circumcision procedure in South Africa. More-
 over, the effect is significantly larger (an increase of 3.6
 percentage points) among women who received the full
 set of eight reminder messages.
 The cost per woman reached of the intervention (less
 than $3) also compares favourably to other interventions
 targeting family planning. In particular, the previous
 evaluation of vouchers and SMS reminders in Kenya
 estimated the average value of the voucher redeemed as
 $4.26 for the contraceptive product alone and did not
 include cost estimates for the text messages or admin-
 istration costs. 26 Given the estimated treatment effects
 observed in this analysis, the cost per woman induced to
 visit a clinic for family planning counselling is $104.82,
 and the cost per woman induced to take up contracep-
 tion is $109.59. 
<section> In addition to encouraging take-­up of contraception,
 the text reminders were particularly effective in encour-
 aging women to visit the clinic promptly: the effect on
 clinic visits within 30 days was proportionally around
 60% larger than the effect on any clinic visit, and among
 women who did visit clinics, they visited on average 1 day
 sooner relative to a median of 8 days. The timing of visits
 is potentially of relevance, given that use of long-­acting
 contraceptives is relatively unusual in this sample: among
 women who visit a clinic, less than a quarter received a
 long-­acting method (3% received an intrauterine device,
 and 19% received a contraceptive implant). (These
 summary statistics were not presented in the Results
 section, as they are simple means rather than treatment
 effects.) These patterns are broadly similar to those
 observed in the most recent Demographic and Health
 Survey conducted in Mozambique in 2011, as only 10%
 of women reporting use of contraception in that survey
 reported use of a long-­acting method.
 In a context in which use of short-­acting contraceptives
 is dominant, interventions that target more timely clinic
 visits may have significant health implications if they
 effectively reduce contraceptive discontinuation, given
 evidence from the literature around high rates of discon-
 tinuation in LMICs. 33 34 Discontinuation is especially high
 for short-­acting methods, 35 though it is also observed for
 long-­acting methods, 36 and is particularly common for
 adolescents. 37 Women who have discontinued previous
 use without switching to a new method thus constitute a
 substantial share of the population of women with unmet
 need. 38 39 While we do not have any systematic data about
 discontinuation of contraceptive methods in this evalu-
 ation, text messages encouraging more rapid follow-­up
 at clinics or with promoters may be a promising strategy
 to reduce discontinuation (allowing for method refill or
 counselling about side effects or options for switching),
 particularly for the adolescent population that is shown
 to be more responsive to the reminders.
 It is important to note that this evaluation was
 conducted in 2020 during a year of acute uncertainty and
 disruption linked to the COVID-­19 pandemic and in a
 general environment of health-­related fears. In Mozam-
 bique, an SOE linked to the pandemic was in effect from
 31 March 2020 to 7 September 2020 (thereafter transi-
 tioning to a state of public calamity); however, promoters
 continued to operate throughout this period, and health
 clinics remained open. (Enrolment in the study was
 paused during the SOE, as described in more detail
 earlier.) Previous work by this research team analysing
 the short-­term effects of the SOE on the behaviour of
 PSI promoters and women found a modest short-­term
 drop in both service provision and use through June
 2020, followed by a relatively rapid rebound. 40 However,
 the fact that the effect of the text reminders is gener-
 ally reduced and more noisily estimated in the post-­SOE
 period constitutes suggestive evidence that in this
 period, other barriers (eg, anxiety about visiting clinics
 or increased economic stress) may have become more
 salient, and our intervention did not effectively target
 these barriers.
 This analysis has a number of strengths and weaknesses.
 It is only the third evaluation to analyse the effectiveness
 of text reminders on contraceptive uptake in LMICs
 and the first to do so including a sample of women who
 are not exclusively postpartum. We analyse a substantial
 sample using administrative data (ie, not relying on self-­
 reported use measures or additional data collection) and
 successfully completed the evaluation in an environment
 of substantial COVID-­related disruptions. Key limitations
 of the evaluation include a high attrition rate (due to an
 inability to match phone numbers recorded manually on
 consent forms to phone numbers recorded in adminis-
 trative data by promoters) and the reliance on a relatively
 narrow administrative dataset. Accordingly, we are unable
 to analyse intervention effects on use of contraception
 in other contexts (outside of public health clinics) and
 are unable to analyse longer-­term use or other health
 outcomes. We also do not have access to any data on
 women’s literacy and their comprehension or recall of
 the messages. Finally, our findings are informative about
 the effectiveness of the reminders on a population of
 women that has already received referrals from health
 promoters and may not be informative about the effects
 of this intervention in a broader population.
 
<section> CONCLUSION
 This paper presents evidence from a randomised
 controlled trial evaluating a series of text message
 reminders designed to increase facility visits for family
 planning services in urban and peri-­urban Mozambique.
 The results suggest that the reminders may be a promising
 strategy to increase clinic visits and associated uptake of
 contraception following referrals by community-­ based
 promoters, and these effects may be largest for younger
 women. Future programming and research work can
 explore the potential of incorporating mobile reminders
 to encourage consistent uptake of family planning
 services.
