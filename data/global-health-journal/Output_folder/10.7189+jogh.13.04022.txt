<section> We randomized 10 municipalities to either the intervention
 or control (five clusters) group. Of the 11 530 women
 between June 8, 2019, and September 30, 2020, 11
 and 9039 included in the final analysis (82%; 3774 in
 group and 5265 in the control group). The odds for
 of maternal behavior-based continuum of care in the in-
 group was not significantly different from that in the con-
 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval
 at three months postpartum. However, the odds of
 antenatal care clinic use were significantly higher in the
 group (odds ratio (OR) = 5.16, 95% CI = 2.50-10.67). No
 associated with the intervention were reported.

<section> The maternal and child (MCH) handbook is an integrated home-based record and is part of a scheme de-
 signed to record in a single document, all the information regarding health services provided to a mother,
 and the health conditions of her and her child, in a single document [1,2]. The MCH handbook covers all
 the stages of maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) from antenatal care to delivery, postnatal care,
 child vaccinations and growth monitoring, and provides health information to parents [1]. Alongside other
 uses, the MCH handbook has the potential to reduce the need for multiple health records [3] and provide
 support for improvements in continuum of care (CoC) [4,5]. Consequently, the MCH handbook has been
 attracting more attention from health ministries and professional organizations as an effective tool for pro-
 tecting the health of mothers and children, and promoting a life course approach to health care [2].
 Although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of home-based records as comple-
 mentary to facility-based records, the superiority of the MCH handbook over other home-based record for-
 mats remains unclear [6,7]. Furthermore, there are few high-quality studies on MCH handbook use [7],
 especially from sub-Saharan African countries that potentially may benefit more from its use as a primary
 record keeping and instructional tool maintained at home than other countries [6]. To address some of the
 research gaps highlighted by WHO guideline for home-based records [6,7], we conducted a cluster random-
 ized controlled trial comparing the use of the integrated MCH handbook with the use of two stand-alone
 home-based records in Angola.
 
<section> The Republic of Angola is a lower middle-income level country located along the west coast of Southern
 Africa [8]. Despite substantial economic and political progress made in recent years, health sector develop-
 ment varied within the country and health indicators are yet to reach adequate standards. The 2015-2016
 Demographic and Health Survey data from Angola show that 239 maternal deaths occurred per 100
 live births; while neonatal and infant mortality rates were 24 and 44 deaths per 1000 live births respective-
 ly [9]. One of the factors contributing to the poor maternal and child health indicators is the weakness of
 health management systems [10]. Additionally, a large information gap on health indicators makes it diffi-
 cult to inform the decision-making process in the country [11].
 
<section> The Government of Angola’s National Plan for Health Development 2012-2025 prioritizes pregnant women,
 infants, and young children as target populations; and the government, with support from the United Na-
 tions (UN), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and other organizations, is working to strength-
 en the health information system in the collection, processing, and analysis of data [10]. Thus, the Angolan
 Ministry of Health, in partnership with JICA, developed and implemented the MCH handbook program to
 improve record keeping and promote maternal and child health care service utilization. We aimed to eval-
 uate the impact of an intervention package involving the use of the MCH handbook and its supplementa-
 ry interventions, compared with traditional use of two stand-alone home-based records on MNCH service
 utilization from pregnancy through the postnatal and early childhood period among women in Angola.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Study design and location
 
<section> This study was an open-label, parallel two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial done within a pregnancy
 cohort in which the use of the MCH handbook was compared with the use of two stand-alone home-based
 records during maternity and childcare service use in Angola. We purposively selected the Benguela prov-
 ince, as its health indicators are close to the national average, thus representing an ideal setting to show in-
 tervention impact on MCH outcomes and demonstrate the feasibility for a nationwide scale-up of the MCH
 handbook in Angola. We favored the cluster randomization design due to the nature of the intervention
 and because it minimized logistical and scientific difficulties associated with individual randomization in
 large-scale longitudinal studies. The central study center in Angola was based at the Benguela office of Do-
 mus Custodius Holding TCHIKOS Consulting Agency, and the overall study coordinating center was at the
 National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo Japan.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> All public health care facilities providing MNCH services in Benguela province were eligible. Our pregnan-
 cy cohort included women who were pregnant at the beginning of the study period and who sought MNCH
 services in participating health care facilities. Women were eligible for inclusion if they had their last men- MCH Handbook for improving continuum of care in Angola
 
<section> area during the study period, and that they gave written informed consent. We recruited participants across
 the MNCH service spectrum during their first health care facility visit during the index pregnancy for any
 of antenatal care, delivery, postnatal care, or, child vaccination services over the study period.
 
<section> Randomization and masking
 
<section> This was a two-arm study comprising an intervention group and a control group; while a cluster was de-
 fined as one municipality. We allocated the municipalities to either intervention or control groups using
 block randomization (shown in Figure S1 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document) conducted by the study
 statistician, as previously described [12]. The statistician was unable to predict assignment to either study
 group. All health care facilities located in the intervention group were service delivery points for the inter-
 vention package, while facilities located in the control group delivered the usual care. We assigned women
 to either study group depending on the location of the health care facility where they attended their first
 MNCH service. Masking was not possible due to the nature of the intervention; thus, neither participants,
 health care providers, data collectors at each facility, nor the rest of the study team were masked. Only the
 data analyst was masked to cluster assignment. Data masking was achieved by replacing municipality names
 with numbers and study groups with letters.
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> We based our study rationale on research gaps highlighted in the 2018 WHO recommendations on home-
 based records for maternal, newborn, and child health [6,7]. The guidelines stressed the lack of knowledge
 on the usefulness and appropriateness of the integrated health handbooks and called for research on whether
 the MCH handbooks are superior to stand-alone home-based records, and if so, under what conditions [6].
 Subsequently, we administered our intervention package after the MCH handbook was designed through
 the MCH handbook committee comprising members from the Ministry of Health in Angola, the WHO,
 UNICEF, JICA, and local bodies (including the Angolan Pediatric Society). The MCH handbook develop-
 ment process in Angola has been previously reported [12,13]. The study design identified in the formative
 phase involved a community-wide distribution of the MCH handbook with its supplementary interventions.
 Study interventions leveraged existing health care infrastructure to facilitate intervention delivery, which
 was divided into three parts: 1) distribution of MCH handbook; 2) health care provider training on MCH
 handbook operation, and 3) community sensitization and mobilization among pregnant women on the use
 of the MCH handbook. We provided the MCH handbook to women during their first contact with health
 care facilities to receive MNCH services for the index pregnancy, with explanations on when and how to use
 the MCH handbook and on data recording. Women also received health education based on the contents
 of the MCH handbook during routine prenatal classes. Women in the control group continued to benefit
 from the traditional use of two stand-alone home-based records – the prenatal card and child health card.
 In both study groups, we asked women to bring their MCH handbook or prenatal card and child health
 card to every occasion of MNCH service consultation. We trained health care providers on MCH handbook
 operation prior to distribution of the MCH handbook to pregnant women/mothers. Initially, we provided
 a five-day training of trainers for selected health care professionals from participating facilities in the inter-
 vention group. Subsequently, trainers from each health care facility provided on-the-job training to health
 care providers at their respective facilities. The training focused on fundamentals of MNCH services, how
 to use and record information in the MCH handbook during regular consultations, how to explain the
 use of the MCH handbook to pregnant women/mothers, and how to interpret data entries from the MCH
 handbook. To enhance eligibility assessment, health care providers in both study groups received training
 on interviewing techniques for determining the date of the last menstrual period and on methods for cal-
 culating probable delivery date. We provided in-facility refresher training of trainers if required following
 periodic visits by the study team to intervention group facilities. Community sensitization and mobiliza-
 tion involved the provision of community events and mothers’ classes using the MCH handbook material
 as educational material.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> Data collectors stationed at each health facility recruited the cohort participants, after which they collected
 data at each participant’s home or location of choice. The baseline survey included questions on socio-de-
 mographic factors, household characteristics, pregnancy history, maternal health behavior, and home-based
 record ownership and use. We suspended trial activities for four months due to COVID-19 lockdown re-
 strictions in Angola, so we consequently extended the follow-up period from three months after delivery to 
<section> six months postpartum and changed some outcome measures. We registered all changes in the trial registry
 prior to the end of data collection. We collected data regarding antenatal care attendance, maternal health
 behavior, pregnancy outcomes, infant feeding practices and infant and maternal health retrospectively from
 women during the follow-up survey. We double-entered the verbal responses obtained from mothers, with
 record entries from individual home-based records for antenatal care, delivery, and vaccination service use,
 when available. We collected the data digitally using interviewer-administered structured questionnaires
 delivered using the Open Data Kit (ODK) Collect application [14]. We matched the women’s responses from
 baseline interview to follow-up records using unique participant identification common to both data sets.
 Two researchers independently performed a case-by-case review of mismatched records using additional
 demographic variables.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal behavior-based CoC, including a minimum
 number of antenatal care visits, facility-based delivery, postnatal care for mother and newborn, and at least
 two child vaccinations clinic visits – at birth and at three months infant age. We followed- up the partici-
 pants at 16 months after the first enrolment to enable outcome assessment for a continuum of maternal and
 child care past three months postpartum. Secondary outcomes were: a composite measure for achievement
 of service-based CoC at three months postpartum; frequency of MNCH service use; neonatal and infant
 mortality rates; infant health check-up; morbidity detection rate for mothers and infants; postpartum de-
 pression; maternal health behavior; infant feeding practices and child vaccination. Vaccinations received
 and date of vaccinations were obtained from home-based records used in the respective study groups. As
 per reporting guidance [15], we reported each component of the composite primary outcome as a second-
 ary outcome. A detailed description of each outcome is provided in the study protocol [12].
 
<section> Statistical analyses
 
<section> Applying a simulation-based power analysis using generalized linear mixed effect model, we estimated that
 a study with at least 10 000 participants would have 80% power to detect an estimated 10% difference in the
 primary outcome between groups with a two-sided α of 0.05 and an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of
 0.01 (Table S1 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document) [12]. We analyzed individual level data according
 to the study group to which women were originally allocated. We also planned per-protocol analysis [12]
 to examine intervention effects based on treatment received. However, due to very high agreement between
 the intention-to-treat analysis set and the per-protocol analysis set (presented in Table S2-3 in the 
<section> Online
 
<section> Supplementary Document), we conducted only an intention-to-treat analysis.
 We descriptively compared baseline characteristics between groups to check that randomization pro-
 duced broadly similar groups. We conducted a single imputation by worst observation carried forward
 for missing values of binary outcome measures to maintain a conservative approach to the analysis. We
 conducted the primary and secondary outcome analyses with generalized linear mixed models assum-
 ing logit link and binomial distribution for binary outcomes, and cumulative logit link and multinomi-
 al distribution for multinomial and ordinal outcomes. The fixed effects were study group (intervention/
 control) and municipality location (urban/rural). We assumed clustering at the municipality level with-
 in the province in a fully nested framework and set municipalities to the random effect. We expressed
 effectiveness estimates as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and reported using the
 Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement extended for cluster randomized
 controlled trials [16]. We conducted a subgroup analysis by facility location for the primary outcome
 and CoC achievement measures. For the statistical analyses, we used the SAS software version 9.4 (SAS
 Institute, Cary, NC, USA). We registered the trial with the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN20510127) where
 the full protocol is publicly available.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> In April 2019, we randomized 10 municipalities in Benguela province to either the intervention or control
 group. We required public health care facilities within each group to provide either standard MNCH ser-
 vices plus distribution of MCH handbook and its supplementary interventions (intervention group) or stan-
 dard MNCH services with continued use of two stand-alone home-based records (control group). We started

<section> At three months postpartum, the odds for achievement of maternal behavior-based CoC in the interven-
 tion group were not significantly different from those of the control group (1132 (30%) of 3774 women in
 the intervention group vs 2145 (41%) of 5265 in the control group; OR = 1.18; 95% CI = 0.48-2.93 (Table 2)).
 
<section> The proportion of women who attained the minimum required number of antenatal care service use was
 similar across the study groups. Facility-based delivery and the use of postnatal care services were compa-
 rable between both study groups, while women in the intervention group were less likely to have attended
 infant postnatal care or achieve at least two vaccination clinic visits as at three-month infant age. Changes
 in individual components of the primary outcome by area are presented in 
<section> Figure 2. Unlike in the urban
 areas, there was a steep decrease in the number of facility-based deliveries in rural areas even among wom-
 en who attained the required minimum antenatal care service use. We observed a similar trend in both in-
 tervention and control groups, with a slightly steeper drop in the intervention group.

 Compared to maternal behavior-based CoC, a smaller proportion of women achieved service-based CoC
 in both groups (26% vs 30% in the intervention group and 38% vs 41% in the control group) and the prob-
 ability of having received all seven childhood vaccinations was lower among women in the intervention
 group compared to those in the control group (Table 2). Results of subgroup analyses for CoC achievement
 by facility location showed no significant difference between the groups (presented in Table S6 in the 
<section> On-
 
<section> line Supplementary Document).
 
<section> Findings on the secondary outcomes reflected a similar trend, except for antenatal care coverage of at least
 one visit. The odds of attending at least one antenatal care clinic was significantly higher in the interven-
 tion group compared to the control group (OR = 5.16, 95% CI = 2.50-10.67) (Table 3). The MCH handbook MCH Handbook for improving continuum of care in Angola
 
<section> intervention package showed no significant differences between groups on other secondary outcomes. In
 the intervention group, a lesser proportion of women reported alcohol use during pregnancy, while a great-
 er proportion of women reported attending HIV counselling and testing for PMTCT (Table 3), however the
 differences were not statistically significant. Regarding other secondary outcomes, no statistically significant
 differences were observed in the proportion of women who reported neonatal or infant deaths, infant health
 check-ups, maternal morbidities and pregnancy complications, infant feeding practices, and complete vac-
 cination at six months infant age. No harms associated with the intervention were reported.
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> We conducted a pragmatic cluster randomized trial of a globally applicable intervention package targeted
 at improving MNCH service use and continuum of care among mothers in Angola. We found that distribu-
 tion of the MCH handbook and its supplementary interventions did not increase MNCH service utilization
 sufficiently enough for the attainment of the primary outcome. Our study is, to the best of our knowledge,
 the first to compare different types of home-based records (integrated vs non-integrated record systems) in
 Africa, thus adding to the limited evidence on the debate regarding the superiority of the integrated MCH
 handbook over stand-alone home-based records.
 
<section> Our findings contradict those of a recent RCT in Bangladesh, which demonstrated significant improvement
 in CoC following use of the MCH handbook enhanced by mobile tools [17]. However, in their study, Gai
 Tobe et al. [17] leveraged the existing MCH handbook implemented in Bangladesh since 2009, and used a
 slightly different definition of CoC varied than we did. Regardless, we found that the MCH handbook in-
 tervention package was effective in initiating antenatal care service use, especially among women in more
 rural settings. Several studies have shown improvements in various elements of the continuum of maternal
 and child care use among mothers who reported pre- and post-natal home-based record ownership. For
 example, improvements in frequency of antenatal care use [18-20], delivery assisted by trained personnel,
 vaccination uptake for mother and child [19,20], and postnatal care guidance [21] were observed among
 mothers who reported ownership of MCH handbook in Indonesia [19,20], Mongolia [18], and Burundi [21].
 Additionally, continuum of care was shown to increase among mothers in Ghana following the introduction
 of a one-page pictorial educational and record card promoting service use across the continuum of mater-
 nal and child care [22].
 
<section> Preliminary findings from its pilot use prior to intervention launch [13] showed the MCH handbook was
 well received (unpublished results), and mothers may have actively sought to attend antenatal care to get
 the handbook. Consequently, the MCH handbook intervention may have worked as an incentive to modify
 demand-side factors in initiating antenatal care use consistent with the trial hypothesis.
 The lack of significant improvement in study-defined CoC could be due to the post-hoc intra-cluster correla-
 tion being higher than expected, thus leading to our study being insufficiently powered to detect a differ-
 ence. The trial sample included 10 clusters, making it sufficient for our statistical hypotheses, but relatively
 small, thus increasing the risk of the clusters not being similar. Simultaneously, the variation between clus-
 ters was large and the post-hoc intra-cluster correlation coefficient was estimated to be about 0.04, larger
 than the initially assumed value of 0.01. Under this assumption of 0.04, the power to detect the expected
 difference was low, at less than 50%, which is consistent with the non-significant results.
 Disparities in health outcomes by urban-rural location, and inequitable access to and use of prenatal care
 between urban and rural areas is pervasive in Angola [9,23]. Also, the lack of human resources for health,
 especially in less urban areas is a major barrier to service delivery [24,25]. Although studies have shown
 that the use of home-based records can promote the continuum of care [4,5,17], its effectiveness is con-
 text-dependent, while availability and equitable distribution of health services are pre-requisite for effec-
 tive promotion of the continuum of care [26]. In this trial’s more rural settings, travel cost and distance to
 facilities were frequently reported barriers for accessing MNCH services. Further, a more acute shortage
 of services meant that services were not always available when mothers presented at health care facilities.
 Thus, inadequate supply of health care services and inputs, especially in rural areas are likely to be import-
 ant constraints to the attainment of the continuum of care for maternal and child health in this study. To
 further elucidate barriers and facilitators to the intervention delivery, we did a mixed-methods implemen-
 tation study which demonstrated the need for strengthening education for health care providers [27]. Our
 study also highlights the importance of health care provider training. As the MCH handbook is only a tool,
 an important component of the MCH handbook intervention package involved health care provider train- 
<section> ing on the operations of the MCH handbook. Pre- and post-training assessments and direct observation re-
 vealed improvements in health care provider knowledge and competence in service delivery using the MCH
 handbook. However, urban/rural and facility level disparities in basic skills and competencies required for
 providing maternity services remain evident [27]. Evidence shows that health care provider training may
 further enhance availability and quality of maternity services when adapted to country needs [28]. Hence
 the need for health care providers to be sufficiently trained in the use and functions of the MCH handbook
 to ensure good quality care cannot be over-emphasized. Future studies should consider to include training
 strategies that employ evidence-based approaches such as low-dose high frequency approaches in which
 health care providers are trained while at work.
 
<section> Strengths and limitations
 
<section> Strengths of our study include the randomized controlled trial design, comparison of the integrated MCH
 handbook against existing stand-alone home-based records, the rigorous trial design wherein we ensured
 the participant cohort had similar maternal characteristics, a low attrition rate and controlling for clustering
 at the municipality level in the analysis. Additionally, the MCH handbook intervention study was a popu-
 lation-based locally driven study done in a real-world and resource constrained setting demonstrating the
 practicability of the intervention.
 
<section> However, it also had some limitations. First, despite the rigorous design, the study was inadequately pow-
 ered. Second, as a pragmatic open-label trial, women may have actively sought maternity care in munici-
 palities providing the MCH handbook. Similarly, we could not avoid health care provider contamination
 resulting from personnel postings and transfer between municipalities. The extent to which women and
 health care providers migrated between clusters could not be established, and if this contributed to limit-
 ing intervention impact is unclear. Incorporating some elements of the intervention package to the control
 group could not be fully excluded which may have led to performance bias. Other administrative barri-
 ers may have limited maternal and child health care service availability, especially in rural areas and these
 limitations could have affected the trial endpoint independent of the intervention package. Third, the im-
 pact of the COVID-19 pandemic on provision of MNCH services and maternal health behavior could not
 be established. Although the collection of follow-up data was delayed, we kept the primary outcome un-
 changed to account for intervention effects prior to the pandemic. Fourth, integrating the trial with routine
 maternity care services may have required health care providers to divert time from routine activities to
 complete trial related steps, which could have negatively affected implementation of the intervention pack-
 age and health care service delivery. Furthermore, provision of the new service could have stretched health
 care provider capacity, leading to longer waiting times and hindering access for women who had to travel
 far to reach health facilities.
 
<section> CONCLUSIONS
 
<section> Although our trial was unable to help us understand the superiority of the MCH handbook over stand-
 -alone home-based records, we were able to show an intervention effect on initiating antenatal care use
 among women. This is an important finding, considering that antenatal care improves the survival and
 health of babies indirectly by providing an entry point for health contacts with women at a vital stage in
 the continuum of care. We also showed that the MCH handbook does not work in isolation and is more
 likely to fulfil its functional role in an improved health system. Further impact evaluation in similar set-
 tings is clearly needed to address the questions regarding superiority of the MCH handbook over stand-
 -alone home-based records, with careful consideration for cluster selection and strategies for adequate
 training of health care providers.
