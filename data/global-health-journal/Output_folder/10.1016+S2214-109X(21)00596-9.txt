 volunteer programmes for corneal ulcer prevention performed
 in several settings in southeast Asia found very low rates of
 corneal ulceration, and a randomised trial in India comparing
 antibiotic versus antifungal prophylaxis found very low rates of
 corneal ulceration in both groups. However, the low rate of
 corneal ulcers in these studies prevented an assessment of the
 effectiveness of the programmes relative to the absence of a
 programme.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 The Village-Integrated Eye Worker trial was a cluster-
 randomised trial in which existing female community health
 volunteers in intervention communities were trained to
 diagnose corneal abrasions and provide prophylaxis with
 topical antibiotics and antifungals. Control communities
 was caused by the programme or by other factors. To
 address this key limitation, a cluster-randomised trial
 was designed to test the effectiveness of a community-
 based programme for corneal ulcer prevention relative
 to an untreated control group. The cluster-randomised
 design was appropriate for the community based
 nature of the intervention and reduced the risk of
 contamination compared with an individually-
 randomised trial. The trial tested the hypothesis that
 introducing a community health volunteer programme
 for the quick diagnosis and management of corneal
 abrasions would ultimately reduce the cluster-level
 incidence of corneal ulcers.
 
<section> Methods
 Study design and participants
 The Village-Integrated Eye Worker (VIEW) trial was a
 cluster-randomised trial performed from Feb 4, 2014, to
 Oct 20, 2017, in the Chitwan and Nawalparasi districts
 of Nepal. Study clusters were government-defined
 administrative units known as village development
 committees (VDCs), which were randomised to receive a
 corneal ulcer prevention programme or to no programme
 and followed up for 3 years for photographic evidence of
 corneal ulceration. The design and methods of the VIEW
 trial have been reported elsewhere. 16 Ethics approval for
 the trial was obtained from the University of California
 San Francisco Committee on Human Research, Nepal
 Netra Jyoti Sangh, and the Nepal Health Research
 Council. A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
 reviewed the protocol before study implementation and
 provided oversight during the trial. The trial adhered to
 the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
<section> received no intervention. A census with corneal photography
 was performed each year during the 3-year trial, and incident
 corneal ulcers were determined by photo-graders masked to
 intervention allocation. Ultimately, the rate of corneal
 ulceration was similar in the two groups, although subgroup
 analyses found that the intervention might be more effective in
 areas that were more rural and remote. Strengths of the study
 include its large size, long duration, and masked outcome
 assessment, as well as its setting in an area with a relatively
 high incidence of corneal ulceration.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 Community health volunteer programmes are a promising
 intervention for corneal ulcer prevention, but such programmes
 might not be effective in all settings and the effectiveness
 might depend on socioeconomic development and availability
 of health facilities. Further study of similar interventions should
 be targeted to rural and remote communities with poor access
 to basic health services.
 
<section> The study was set in a low-lying, agrarian, relatively
 densely populated part of Nepal; approximately three-
 quarters of the population was literate in the 2011
 national census. 17 VDCs were administrative divisions in
 existence at the start of the study; each VDC consisted of
 nine wards. Each ward had a government-supported
 female community health volunteer (FCHV) elected by
 the community to perform public health tasks (eg, family
 planning and nutrition education for pregnant women).
 VIEW leveraged the FCHV programme, adding eye care
 to their portfolio of services.
 Because the intervention was thought likely to be most
 effective in rural areas, VDCs in the catchment area of
 Bharatpur Eye Hospital with a population of less than
 15 000 on the 2001 Nepal census were deemed eligible.
 Residents of all ages, from all households in the study
 communities were offered enrolment through an annual
 door-to-door census by census workers. Participants were
 eligible if they were residing in the catchment area at the
 time of the census. Verbal informed consent was
 obtained for census activities before randomisation was
 performed. Written informed consent was obtained for
 the FCHV intervention after randomisation was
 completed.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 VDCs were stratified by district (ie, Chitwan vs
 Nawalparasi; appendix p5) and randomly assigned (1:1) to
 receive the intervention (FCHV corneal ulcer prevention
 programme) or no intervention (control group). The

 Computing, version 3 (Vienna, Austria) to generate the

 (Conexus, Los Gatos, CA, USA). Corneal photographs
 were taken using the Corneal CellScope (Development
 Impact Lab, Berkeley, CA, USA), a custom-made
 3D-printed smartphone attachment with a +25 dioptre
 lens and external illumination. Photographs were taken
 of both eyes of all residents at the baseline and final
 censuses, and of both eyes of residents answering
 positively to one of the eye trauma screening questions
 during interim censuses.
 Photographs were graded for evidence of incident
 corneal ulceration by trained graders, masked to the
 intervention allocation. For study purposes incident
 corneal ulceration was defined as evidence of an active
 corneal ulcer or a new opacity not present at a previous
 census. All photographs taken of an eye during a census
 were presented together, and grades were assigned to the
 eye. Photographs from individuals who answered any
 screening questions about eye trauma positively at a
 follow-up census were presented to two trained graders
 in a random order, without identifying information. Sets
 of photographs were presented for each eye and each
 census separately, and they were graded for corneal
 ulceration on a 4-category ordinal scale (eg, definitely yes,
 probably, possibly, and definitely no). If the photograph
 of the eye was graded as having possible, probable, or
 definite evidence of corneal ulceration (eg, either an
 active ulcer or an opacity) then all photographs from
 previous censuses were displayed to determine whether
 the corneal pathology had developed since the previous
 photograph. If photographs from a previous phase were

 definite or probable corneal ulceration at one census, and
 possible or no ulceration in the same eye at a previous
 census.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome was incidence of corneal
 ulceration, assessed from masked grading of corneal
 photographs taken at each census. Individuals were
 allowed to contribute multiple incident ulcers over the
 study but could contribute no more than one new
 incident ulcer per eye per census period. Pre-specified
 secondary outcomes were the prevalence of visual
 impairment caused by incident corneal ulceration and
 the cost-effectiveness of the intervention (each to be
 reported in a separate publication) as well as the fidelity
 indicators of time from eye trauma to FCHV presentation
 (intervention group only) and awareness of study
 intervention (both groups).
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 We estimated that including 12 VDCs per group would
 provide greater than 80% power to detect a 30% reduction
 in the incidence of corneal ulcers at an α of 0·05. This
 calculation assumed 9000 individuals per cluster
 (VDC) based on average VDC size in the study area, an
 annual incidence in the control group of 100 cases per
 100 000 person-years based on previous studies, an intra-
 class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0·00015, and 3 years
 of follow-up.
 The primary intention-to-treat analysis employed
 negative binomial regression on VDC-level data to
 model the count of incident corneal ulcers during the
 entire study period as a function of treatment group,
 with log person time-at-risk as an offset. For the time-at-
 risk, individuals began contributing person-time at the
 first census in which they had photographs taken and
 continued to contribute time until their final census
 visit. Participants were censored if documented as
 having died or moved on the census, or at the final
 census visit (36 months), whichever occurred first.
 Individuals with incident corneal ulcers continued to
 contribute person-time since they remained at risk for
 additional ulcers. The model’s dispersion parameter
 accounted for the clustered nature of the data.
 Significance testing was performed by Monte Carlo
 permutation (n=10 000 replications, accounting for
 stratified randomisation), with an overall α of 0·05 for
 the interim and final analyses. The pre-planned interim
 analysis was performed after the first follow-up census;
 this analysis spent 0·001 α and did not meet pre-
 specified criteria for stopping early. Exploratory
 subgroup analyses were performed using similar
 regression models, but on ward-level data. Analyses
 were performed in R (version 4). The manual of
 procedures and statistical analysis plan are available.

 random sample of households in each VDC was surveyed. A member of the
 household was asked an open-ended question about where they would go if
 they experienced eye trauma, and their preferred provider was recorded. In the
 second and third annual surveys, the respondent was asked about all the
 providers available for eye trauma, regardless of whether it was their preferred
 provider. Panel A shows the distribution of responses for the preferred provider

 annual training. Study staff helped FCHVs maintain
 their inventories of supplies and printed materials for
 publicity campaigns. However, it took a while to build
 awareness of the intervention, and awareness still had
 not reached peak by the time of the third annual
 household survey. It is possible that the intervention
 was not instituted for a long enough period of time
 for community members to be aware of the FCHV
 programme and trust the FCHV’s diagnostic abilities
 and management skills. Although FCHV visits for
 abrasions increased substantially each year of the study,
 the intervention almost certainly continued to miss
 some community members, either because of a lack
 of awareness or because they preferred to seek care
 elsewhere. Furthermore, community members in the
 control VDCs might also have been receiving prompt
 treatment, either from a health-care professional or from
 a medical shop. A survey of medical shops in the study
 area found that antibiotics were recommended for most
 eye conditions, so it is possible that community members
 with corneal abrasions in the control communities were
 also receiving appropriate prophylaxis.
 An intriguing finding of this study—albeit in an
 exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis—was the

 communities. Awareness and participant responsiveness
 increased over the study period, sugges­ ting that
 community-based programmes may need longer
 observation periods to determine effectiveness.
