 Ukraine.
 
<section> Methods. We conducted a three-armed randomized-controlled trial of CETA delivered in its
 standard form (8–12 sessions), a brief form (five-sessions), and a wait-control condition.
 Eligible participants were displaced adults, army veterans and their adult family members
 with elevated depression and/or PTS and impaired functioning. Treatment was delivered by
 community-based providers trained in both standard and brief CETA. Outcome data were
 collected monthly.
 
<section> Results. There were 302 trial participants (n = 117 brief CETA, n = 129 standard CETA, n =
 wait-controls). Compared with wait-controls, participants in standard and brief CETA experi-
 enced clinically and statistically significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and PTS and
 dysfunction (effect sizes d = 0.46–1.0–6). Comparing those who received standard CETA
 with brief CETA, the former reported fewer symptoms and less dysfunction with small-to-
 medium effect sized (d = 0.20–0.55).
 
<section> Conclusions. Standard CETA is more effective than brief CETA, but brief CETA also had sig-
 nificant effects compared with wait-controls. Given demonstrated effectiveness, CETA could
 be scaled up as an effective community-based approach.
 
<section> Introduction
 
<section> Since 2014 military conflict with Russia-backed separatists has left 13 000 casualties and 3.4
 million people requiring humanitarian assistance (United Nations Office for the
 Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 2020). Conflict affected populations in Ukraine have
 high prevalence rates for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 32%), depression (22%), anx-
 iety (17%) and alcohol use disorders (8.4% in men and 0.7% in women) (Weissbecker et al.,
 
<section> 2017; Ramachandran et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2019). 74% of adult internally displaced per-
 sons (IDPs) who likely required mental health services reported not receiving them due to lack

 reports of abuse under the Soviet system, as well as health system deficiencies like lack of infor-
 mation and awareness, high cost of treatment, fear of a public record of mental illness diag-
 nosis, and geographical distance (Weissbecker et al., 2017; Romaniuk and Semigina, 2018).
 The prevalence of common mental health problems in the general population has increased 
<section> over the past decade (Voloshyn and Maruta, 2015; Weissbecker
 et al., 2017; Ramachandran et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2019)
 while the prevalence of clinician diagnoses and treatment has
 decreased (Voloshyn and Maruta, 2015), likely due to ongoing
 stigmatization of psychiatric services (Weissbecker et al., 2017)
 and budgetary and economic issues (Skokauskas et al.,
 2020).The burden of common mental health problems would
 likely be better met by mental health care at the community
 level. Elsewhere, community-based mental health treatment mod-
 els have been developed to reduce the treatment gap (Kohn et al.,
 2004; Thornicroft, 2007; Thornicroft et al., 2016) by making ser-
 vices more culturally responsive and locally accessible (Castillo
 et al., 2019), can treat multiple problems while being less resource
 intensive than specialized care, and are therefore more scalable
 and sustainable (World Health Organization, 2017; Patel et al.,
 2018).
 The common elements treatment approach (CETA) (Murray
 et al., 2014a), a cognitive-behavioral therapy-based treatment,
 was developed as a community-based intervention to address
 multiple and comorbid mental health problems in low- and
 middle-income countries (LMIC) (Murray et al., 2014a, 2020).
 
<section> While CETA has been shown effective in other LMIC settings
 including Iraq (Weiss et al., 2015), Thailand (Bolton et al.,
 
<section> 2014), Zambia (Murray et al., 2020), Colombia (Bonilla-Escobar
 et al., 2018) and Ethiopia (Murray et al., 2018b), it has not
 been used or tested in the former Soviet Union. This is true of
 the global mental health literature overall: most LMIC interven-
 tion trials, both clinic- and community-based, have been con-
 ducted in Africa with few in Asia and Latin America (Chibanda
 et al., 2015; Purgato et al., 2018). In our review of the
 English-language literature, we found no trials from former
 Soviet Union countries, where cultural and contextual factors
 are very different from other regions. The few trials in the
 Russian language literature found locally modified cognitive-
 behavioral psychotherapy effective for anxiety disorders in a gen-
 eral psychiatric population (Tukaev and Kuznetsov, 2015) and
 motivational interviewing effective for alcohol use disorders
 (Trusova, 2015). Given the contextual and cultural differences
 that set this region apart from other global regions, we felt it
 necessary to test CETA locally.
 We also explored a key implementation question: whether a
 shortened five-session version of CETA could be as effective as
 the standard 8–12 session model in order to address scale-up
 challenges, particularly with highly mobile populations, including
 displaced persons.
 To address these aims, this study had two objectives: (1) to
 evaluate the effectiveness of standard CETA among a
 conflict-affected population in Ukraine; and (2) to compare the
 effectiveness of brief CETA to standard CETA using a non-
 inferiority design.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> This study is a three-armed randomized-controlled trial con-
 ducted among a conflict-affected population: adult IDPs and
 Ukrainian veterans and their families. The three conditions
 included: (1) standard CETA, (2) brief CETA, and (3) waitlist
 controls; participants in the CETA arms were blind to their allo-
 cation to brief or standard versions. The primary outcomes of the
 trial included severity of depression and post-traumatic stress
 symptoms, and impaired functioning and secondary outcomes
 included anxiety symptoms and substance use problems. This
 trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03058302.
 
<section> Providers
 
<section> The trial was conducted in Kyiv (central region), Zaporizhya
 (southeast), and Kharkiv (east, near Russian border). Thirty-one
 individuals working in these communities were trained as provi-
 ders by CETA co-developers (Laura K. Murray, S D and other
 CETA trainers (Stephanie Skavenski, Kristie Metz, Laura
 Merchant) using the apprenticeship model (Murray et al., 2011)
 of didactic training followed by supervised practice.
 Concurrently, five others were trained as local supervisors.
 Providers were psychologists, social workers, volunteers, physi-
 cians, program managers, teachers/lecturers or lawyers (Murray
 et al., 2018a, 2018b). Some were experienced serving IDPs and
 other conflict-affected groups and some were veterans. Prior
 qualitative research found that veterans are more willing to talk
 to other veterans (Singh et al., 2021). Fifteen providers were
 based in Kyiv City, four in Kharkiv City, eight in Zaporizhya
 City, and four were in smaller towns in Zaporizhya region.
 Providers met with participants individually in private rooms,
 typically at the provider’s place of employment, state social ser-
 vices, or local non-governmental organizations (NGOs). No ses-
 sions were conducted in hospitals or state mental health
 institutions. Recruitment materials and the CETA manual for
 provider were offered in Ukrainian language while the implemen-
 tation and the mental health assessment inventory (MHAI) out-
 come measure, a previously validated tool to assess common
 mental health problems (Doty et al., 2018), were in Russian lan-
 guage because the majority of study participants, mostly IDPs,
 preferred Russian.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> Participants had to give informed consent, be at least 18 years old,
 and expect to remain in a study location for at least 6 months and
 be either a veteran, veteran family member, or IDP. We also
 included people who volunteered in the conflict or were otherwise
 helping affected persons. These population criteria were based on
 the target population of our funder. Clinical inclusion criteria
 included reporting elevated depression and/or posttraumatic
 stress symptoms (PTS) and impaired daily functioning at baseline.
 Screening for elevated symptoms and impaired functioning was
 done using a shortened version of the outcome instrument
 (MHAI; described below) (Doty et al., 2018).
 Exclusion criteria included active-duty (non-veteran) military
 personnel and adults who were determined at baseline to need
 urgent referral to a psychiatrist for suicidal or homicidal ideation
 or severe psychiatric symptoms or drug use problems that neces-
 sitate inpatient treatment and would inhibit their ability to par-
 ticipate in a talk-therapy. These adults were determined by local
 clinical CETA supervisors and psychiatrist at the National
 University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA) Mental
 Health Center. Adults excluded based on these criteria were
 referred to external specialist mental health services.
 Study participants were referred by providers from their exist-
 ing work-related network and by community-based organizations
 (CBOs) and NGOs working with these populations. CBO and
 NGO staff were trained to use a short screening version of the 
<section> outcome measure (Doty et al., 2018) and refer potential partici-
 pants who showed PTSD or depression symptoms.
 
<section> Outcome measure
 
<section> The outcome measure, the MHAI, was locally adapted and vali-
 dated to assess clinically significant mental health problems
 (Doty et al., 2018). The MHAI includes items related to the pri-
 mary and secondary common mental health outcomes (depres-
 sion, posttraumatic stress, generalized anxiety, and alcohol use)
 and a functioning scale. The validation process is described else-
 where (Doty et al., 2018). The functioning scale includes World
 Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule
 (WHODAS) items and locally relevant items based on a prior
 qualitative study in Zaporizhya and Kharkiv (Applied Mental
 Health Research Group Johns Hopkins University, 2013; Singh
 et al., 2021).
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> For comparison of brief and standard CETA to the waitlist control
 condition, the sample size was based on power of 0.80 (β = 0.20)
 at α = 0.025 level of significance (adjusted for multiple compari-
 sons), to detect a medium effect ( f = 0.25). Sample size for the
 non-inferiority comparison of brief v. standard CETA was
 based on power of 0.80 (β = 0.20) at α = 0.05 level of significance,
 with an assumed S D of 7.0 and a non-inferiority limit of d = 2.4.
 Accounting for 24% attrition, the recruitment goal was
 participants.
 
<section> Randomization
 
<section> We implemented a two-stage sequential randomization process.
 First stage randomization was conducted by computer algorithm
 into waitlist control or CETA conditions (brief and standard com-
 bined) at a 1:4 ratio. The algorithm was integrated into the data
 collection software with randomization immediately after deter-
 mining trial eligibility. The second stage allocated those in the
 CETA condition to either brief or standard treatment; randomiza-
 tion was based on a computer-generated list of random numbers
 with a ratio of 1:1. This second stage randomization was done in
 blocks of 20 by provider, to ensure evenly distribution among
 providers.
 
<section> Blinding
 
<section> First stage randomization (waitlist control/CETA) was not blinded
 but revealed to participants immediately after baseline assessment.
 For second stage randomization, participants, providers, supervi-
 sors, and CETA trainers were kept blind to allocation to brief or
 standard CETA until after the fourth CETA session. The study
 director then checked assignment and revealed the allocation to
 the supervisor and provider who then told the study participant.
 Only the study director and two analysts on the data monitoring
 team had access to the password-protected database linking study
 ID to the brief or standard CETA randomization schema. This
 ensured that randomization to brief or standard CETA did not
 impact the way the first four sessions were provided by provider
 or received by participant.
 
<section> Interventions
 
<section> Two version of CETA – standard and brief – were tested; (for full
 descriptions see trial protocol manuscript (Murray et al., 2018a,
 2018b). CETA is a modular, multi-problem, flexible, transdiagnostic
 approach developed for LMIC, based on task-sharing by providers
 with minimal or no formal mental health training (Murray et al.,
 2014a, 2018a, 2018b). We designed the brief CETA model based
 on recent research on how to increase efficiency without losing
 effectiveness (Hayes et al., 2007a, 2007b; Huebner and Tonigan,
 2007; Insel, 2009).
 Participants randomized to standard CETA began with the
 same first session flows as brief CETA. Providers had flexibility
 in choosing the elements, order and dose for participants in
 standard CETA beyond the fourth session, based on symptom
 presentation and discussions of participant progress with their
 supervisors (Murray et al., 2014a).
 Throughout the trial, supervision followed the apprenticeship
 model (Murray et al., 2011) with weekly provider oversight by
 CETA trainers to monitor and ensure treatment fidelity for
 both standard and brief CETA. Both versions of CETA also
 included safety check ins at every session (Murray et al., 2014b).
 All safety cases were handled within 24-hours with immediate
 notification of NaUKMA and Johns Hopkins School of Public
 Health (JHSPH) research teams.
 
<section> Waitlist control condition
 
<section> Waitlist control participants were provided with a list of available
 mental health resources and, like all trial participants, were free to
 use these services. All use of other services was tracked over the
 course of the trial. After participating in the waitlist control con-
 dition for 6 months, control participants were offered standard
 CETA.
 
<section> Data collection
 
<section> Data were collected via a self-administered digital survey using the
 open source mobile data collection platform CommCare (https://
 www.commcarehq.org). Study enrollment and data collection
 began in March 2017 and data collection was completed in
 June 2019. Baseline assessments (time 0) were completed prior
 to first stage CETA/waitlist control randomization. After baseline,
 waitlist control participants were asked to complete monthly
 assessments until 6-months post-baseline (times 1–6). CETA par-
 ticipants also completed these assessments after every fourth
 weekly visit with their counselor. After completion of standard
 or brief CETA treatment, participants continued to complete
 assessments every month until the end of the 6 month period.
 Because treatment participants may not be able to attend the
 CETA sessions every week, for brief CETA participants, we
 expected 3–4 of these assessments would be completed after treat-
 ment was over and for standard CETA participants, we expected
 2–3 of these assessments would be completed after treatment was
 over. Baseline and follow-up assessments were done at a central
 location in each city using study tablets, with study staff present
 to support the technology and answer questions. In cases where
 a study participant could not attend in person study staff would
 conduct the assessment by phone.
 During baseline screening, 73 clients reported suicidal or
 homicidal ideations, triggering the safety protocols. Most were
 found to be at low risk after additional questioning by study

<section> M&E staff; 17 were referred to a psychiatrist for further assess-
 ment. Although they were not included in the study, standard
 CETA was offered to all of these clients after evaluation. During
 the study, there were no adverse events.
 At the beginning of clinical sessions, as a normal part of treatment,
 a clinical monitoring form was self-administered on CommCare to
 guide treatment. This trial was reviewed and approved by the
 JHSPH and the NaUKMA Institutional Review Boards.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> As per the trial protocol brief and standard CETA were each compared
 separately to the waitlist control condition using the six monthly
 assessments collected post baseline (Murray et al., 2018a, 2018b).
 Due to variations in participants availability for the assessment we
 included assessments up to 2 weeks prior or after the targeted monthly
 date. Baseline assessments were coded as assessment zero (0). Each
 subsequent monthly assessment was coded as assessment 1, 2,
 through 6. Under the protocol analysis we planned to investigate
 the effects of brief and standard CETA, compared with the waitlist
 control condition over these six discrete timepoints. Figure 1a pre-
 sents the flow of participants included in the protocol analysis.

<section> analysis.
 
<section> In reviewing the data at the end of the trial, we identified that
 some CETA participants did not complete treatment within the
 6-month time frame or had only one post-treatment assessments,
 providing none or limited post-treatment assessment data making
 the planned longitudinal analyses untenable for these partici-
 pants. Therefore, a post-hoc analysis approach was also used, to
 provide a more equivalent comparison between study arms.
 Using a pre-post design, we used a single post-intervention assess-
 ment for each brief and standard CETA participant and an
 equivalent assessment for each waitlist control participant. To
 remain in line with the original planned analysis of outcomes at
 6 months post baseline, for this analysis we used each partici-
 pant’s post-intervention assessment closest to the 6 month follow
 up (180 days plus 122 days or minus 30 days). The amount of
 change was calculated for each participant by comparing this sin-
 gle post-treatment assessment to their baseline. Figure 1b presents
 the flow of participants included in the pre-post analysis.
 All outcomes (depression, anxiety, and PTS, and functioning)
 were treated as continuous. Sample characteristics were explored
 across treatment conditions at baseline. Random effects models
 with a robust variance estimator were used to compare change
 in outcomes between trial conditions. Sensitivity analyses

 examined the impact on model results of including the number of
 days on study (between baseline and the final assessment) as a
 covariate. For the second analysis, multiple imputation with
 chained equations accounted for scale level missingness of out-
 come data (Azur et al., 2011). Using imputed data, the effects
 of brief and standard CETA on symptoms and functioning
 between baseline and follow-up were assessed using mixed effects
 regression models with clustering at the individual, provider, and
 city levels. Cohen’s d was used to calculate effect sizes for
 each outcome, reflecting regression adjustments. Statistical
 analyses were performed using Stata 15 (Stata Statistical
 Software, 2017).

<insert> Fig. 1a). Only nine participants (3%) had data for all six-
 monthly assessments after baseline. Sixty-four participants
 (21%), had no data after baseline [11 (20%) control, 21 (18%)
 brief CETA, and 32 (25%) standard CETA]; 108 participants
 (36%) had data from only one or two of the monthly assess-
 ments. Seven CETA participants (six standard; one brief)
 were still receiving treatment at the 6-month post baseline
 assessment time point, so this final assessment was not
 post-treatment.
 The planned protocol analysis, showing overall trends for
 predicted symptom and dysfunction scores by treatment condi-
 tion over the 6-month follow-up period, are shown in
 Supplement Figures 1S–4S. The results of unimputed models
 indicated that brief and standard CETA participants had statis-
 tically significantly lower predicted depression, post-traumatic
 stress, anxiety, and dysfunction scores on at least one time
 point during follow up relative to waitlist controls. Standard
 CETA participants had statistically significantly lower average
 predicted depression and posttraumatic stress scores at least
 one time point during follow up relative to brief CETA partici-
 pants. Sensitivity analyses, including the number of days on
 study, did not change the direction or significantly alter the
 magnitude of treatment effects.

<section> For the pre-post analysis, we used data from the 204 partici-
 pants with post-intervention (brief and standard CETA partici-
 pants) or post-baseline (waitlist control participants) assessment
 data. The included assessment data were conducted an average
 of 211 days after baseline (range of 150–299 days). Follow up
 data were missing from 98 participants [brief CETA n =
 
<section> (28%), standard CETA n = 51 (40%), waitlist control = 14 (25%)].
 Treatment effects using this pre-post analysis for brief and
 standard CETA compared with waitlist controls are presented
 in Tables 2 and treatment effects comparing brief to standard
 CETA are presented in Table 3. Reductions in depression, post-
 traumatic stress, anxiety, and dysfunction were greater among
 those receiving standard CETA relative to those in the waitlist
 control condition with medium to large effect sizes (d = 0.60–
 1.06). Reductions in all outcomes were also observed among
 those receiving brief CETA, relative to waitlist controls with
 medium effect sizes (d = 0.46–0.62).
 When comparing the effectiveness of standard to brief CETA,
 those receiving standard CETA reported fewer symptoms and less
 dysfunction at post-assessment, with medium effect sizes for
 depression (d = 0.55) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (d =
 0.47) and small effect sizes for anxiety symptoms (d = 0.32) and
 dysfunction (d = 0.20). When comparing imputed to non-imputed

 models in sensitivity analyses, only minimal differences were
 observed between effect estimates (see Online Supplemental tables
 
<section> 1S and 2S).
 Among waitlist control participants, only seven reported seek-
 ing outside mental health services. These consisted of an appoint-
 ment with a psychiatrist in a mental health clinic or in a general
 polyclinic.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> This trial examined the effectiveness of both standard and brief
 CETA compared to a wait-list control condition among veterans
 and IDPs in three areas of Ukraine during a period of instability
 and conflict. Both brief and standard CETA reduced the severity
 of depression, anxiety and PTS and functional impairment, with
 the strongest impacts for those who participated in standard
 CETA.
 Among possible community-based interventions CETA was
 chosen due to the comorbidity we found within populations of
 veterans and IDPs in our qualitative work (Singh et al., 2021),
 similar to findings in other trauma/conflict-affected populations.
 CETA is a particular approach – namely modular, flexible and
 multi-problem (see more on transdiagnostic definitions
 (Boustani et al., 2017; Sauer-Zavala et al., 2017; Martin et al.,
 2018) able to address stress and traumatic events including con-
 flict and deprivation, and common comorbidities - depression,
 anxiety, violence, suicide, and substance use. Use of a more lim-
 ited transdiagnostic approach such as Problem Management Plus
 (PM+) (which does not include a direct focus on traumatic stress
 symptoms) was therefore not considered appropriate for this type
 population (Dawson et al., 2015).
 To date we have tested CETA in Africa, southeast Asia, South
 America, and the Middle East. While Ukraine is culturally part of
 Europe where similar interventions have been tested, the combin-
 ation of differences between eastern and western Europe, the
 strong historical legacy of the former Soviet Union, and the dearth
 of effectiveness studies of Mental Health and Psychosocial
 Support (MHPSS) interventions in the former Soviet region sug-
 gested a need for local testing.
 
<section> That standard CETA had a greater impact on symptom reduc-
 tion compared with brief CETA could suggest a dose response
 effect of more sessions or additional elements. The standard con-
 dition allowed for more personalization and time to address mul-
 tiple problems. It also provides more contact with the provider.
 Other possibilities include contextual and population-based fac-
 tors. Throughout the trial, many participants or their family
 and friends were traveling to the Russian front, re-living battles,
 hearing about them, and experiencing stresses related to conflict
 (e.g. losing loved ones, losing homes). This ongoing context
 may require longer treatment. It would be interesting to evaluate
 a shorter version of CETA in a less traumatic or stressful context,
 or perhaps with a population that presented with milder
 symptomatology.
 Many study participants in the brief CETA condition were
 unhappy about ending treatment, as were CETA providers, if
 they thought a participant needed more treatment. This could
 be partly due to cultural expectations of therapy being longer
 and needing to be longer. To a lesser degree, some study partici-
 pants and CETA providers were unhappy about being ‘forced’ to
 continue with treatment after their symptoms greatly reduced.
 Participants in both standard and brief CETA reported signifi-
 cant and similar effects on function compared to waitlist controls.
 This suggests that CETA may have improved function through
 mechanisms other than symptom reduction and independently
 of CETA duration. Perhaps a connection to a counselor and/or
 the presence of certain elements were important to improving
 function but not the dose of elements.
 
<section> Limitations
 
<section> Missing participant follow-up assessments were a significant limi-
 tation of the trial. The originally trial analysis plan expected that
 CETA participants would attend treatment sessions weekly and
 that monthly data collection would occur after every fourth treat-
 ment visit. Often treatment visits did not happen every week and
 so the duration between data collection points was not consistent
 across CETA participants and some CETA participant remained
 in treatment for more than 6 months. This rendered the results
 of our original analysis plan as suggestive only, in that many of
 the planned monthly assessments for standard CETA occurred
 while treatment was being provided, rather than some being com-
 pleted during treatment and some after treatment completion.
 Some of the reasons treatment completion was delayed included
 lengthy breaks and holidays, trips back to the conflict areas, chan-
 ging living area, and/or successful employment that resulted in
 lack of time for attending sessions. These delays and dropouts
 produced a reduced sample of follow up data biased towards
 those participants who were more invested and compliant with
 treatment. For this reason, we added a pre-post analysis that
 allowed us to include a less biased sample, although missing
 data were still a limitation. These challenges were greater in this
 study than in previous trials in other global regions, partly due
 to local cultural (e.g. long holiday periods), and situational vari-
 ables (e.g. ongoing conflict).
 Causes of missed sessions and missed assessments among all
 participants were: (a) IDPs tended to move during the trial and
 to leave no means of further contact, and (b) participants often
 changed phone numbers without explanation or providing new
 numbers. Among the participants in the CETA conditions, add-
 itional factors included, (a) dissatisfaction about being provided
 with brief treatment (i.e. 4–5 sessions), and (b) annoyance at 
<section> being contacted outside treatment. Continuing attempts of
 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) staff to follow up with partici-
 pants was understood as a culturally inappropriate imposition
 and resulted in some participants rejecting all contacts with the
 research team. To address these concerns: (a) a recruitment officer
 reached out to family members and related peer groups and local
 communities to obtain new contact information/phone numbers
 of lost participants; (b) CETA counselors reached out to their
 participants and asked them to complete assessment forms; and
 (c) M&E staff asked participants who rejected participation in fol-
 low up assessments to complete the monthly assessment form at
 least once.
 We had limited information on what treatments the waitlist
 control participants accessed beyond reporting whether they con-
 sulted a psychiatrist or psychologist in part due to a programming
 error with our data collection system which did not ask for details
 on the kind of help they received. For those participants who did
 provide information on whether they had sought out mental
 health services, we received only a few responses and almost no
 descriptions. It appears that the engagement with mental health
 services outside of CETA was very limited based on self-report.
 Finally, while we provided substance use specific elements in
 both brief and standard CETA, we were not able to complete
 impact analyses on substance use outcomes due to an error in
 programming the data collection software. This error resulted in
 a lack of consistency in data collection on the substance use out-
 comes limiting the reliability of the data we do have. Therefore,
 those results are not reported.
 
<section> Conclusions
 
<section> This study constitutes the first trial in Ukraine, and in the former
 Soviet region, of a community-based approach for common mental
 health problems. Despite study and program challenges, we found
 that standard CETA is more effective for reducing symptoms of
 common mental health problems than brief CETA, but brief
 CETA also had significant effects compared with waitlist controls.
 Both versions of CETA had a similar effect on function. Based on
 these results, the standard CETA model is preferred because it
 includes the full range of treatment elements and can be more
 appropriately tailored to the needs of each client. Brief CETA can
 be considered a reasonable option where the standard model is
 not possible due to logistical constraints, such as with highly mobile
 populations. Given the concerns of providers and participants that
 treatment was sometimes too long or too short, we recommend
 that CETA not be confined to ‘standard’ or ‘Short’. Rather, the
 end of treatment should be determined by the provider in consult-
 ation with the participant, based on improved symptoms, mastery
 of skills, and/or participant desires. As a modular approach that is
 designed to vary with client needs, CETA is suitable for such var-
 iations in duration. Future research should utilize implementation
 science designs to evaluate the uptake, effectiveness, and acceptabil-
 ity and cost of CETA of varying length in this way.
 This study, building on the evidence from CETA trials, sug-
 gests that CETA should be expanded within Ukraine. With the
 advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
 we have developed distance-based tools and training materials
 for CETA, and have trained local providers who are now fully
 capable of acting as local trainers. These will result in capacity
 to conduct training, supervision, and service provision by internet
 and phone. This increased capacity will allow for expanding pro-
 gram reach throughout Ukraine, including to rural areas and
 border areas with ongoing instability, most of which currently
 have no mental health service access.
