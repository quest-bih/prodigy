<section> Abstract
 
<section> The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC) to
 increase the application of essential birth practices to ultimately reduce perinatal and mater-
 nal deaths. We study the effects of the SCC on health workers safety culture, in the frame-
 work of a cluster-randomized controlled trial (16 treatment facilities/16 control facilities). We
 introduced the SCC in combination with a medium intensity coaching in health facilities
 which already offered at minimum basic emergency obstetric and newborn care (BEMonC).
 We assess the effects of using the SCC on 14 outcome variables measuring self-perceived
 information access, information transmission, frequency of errors, workload and access to
 resources at the facility level. We apply Ordinary Least Square regressions to identify an
 Intention to Treat Effect (ITT) and Instrumental Variable regressions to determine a Com-
 plier Average Causal Effect (CACE). The results suggest that the treatment significantly
 improved self-assessed attitudes regarding the probability of calling attention to problems
 with patient care (ITT 0.6945 standard deviations) and the frequency of errors in times of
 excessive workload (ITT -0.6318 standard deviations). Moreover, self-assessed resource
 access increased (ITT 0.6150 standard deviations). The other eleven outcomes were unaf-
 fected. The findings suggest that checklists can contribute to an improvement in some
 dimensions of safety culture among health workers. However, the complier analysis also
 highlights that achieving adherence remains a key challenge to make checklists effective.
 
<section> Introduction
 
<section> The Lancet Global Health Commission on High-quality Health Systems suggests that in many
 settings unskilled labor or avoidable mistakes lead to a suboptimal level of care despite increas-
 ing access to the health system [1]. Particularly, childbirth remains a context that is likely to
 benefit from an improvement of health workers’ attitudes and perceptions (which we subsume

<section> in the following under the term safety culture). In 2015, approximately 303,000 maternal
 deaths occurred, and in 2016, 5.6 million children below the age of five died worldwide due
 largely preventable causes [2, 3]. While the global neonatal mortality rate equaled 18.0 per
 1,000 live births in 2017, the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 aims to reduce the rate to
 12.0 per 1,000 live births.
 Checklists have been identified as a low-cost intervention to improve quality in different
 sectors [4, 5] and to contribute to a “safety culture” [6]. The World Health Organization
 (WHO) introduced a global collaborative effort to create a Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC) [7].
 The checklist consists of four pages, reminding users about essential practices to follow and
 includes a brief explanation for each point.
 To assess the SCC’s effectiveness, the WHO invited practitioners and academics alike to
 evaluate the checklist in different contexts. A systematic review of this evidence indicates that
 the SCC can increase essential birth practices, and may even reduce stillbirth [8]. Moreover,
 Walker et al. [9] provide causal evidence that the SCC reduced neonatal mortality in Kenya
 and Uganda when coupled with other interventions. However, above initial uptake, a change
 in safety culture is required to achieve sustainable behavioral change. Active usage of the SCC
 by health workers is a pre-condition for reaping those benefits, where, in several contexts, lim-
 ited usage constrained the application of the checklist [10]. Observational studies conducted
 Sri Lanka and Namibia, observed SCC usage rates of 45.8% and 75% during birthing processes
 [11, 12]. So far, there is only scant evidence from non-randomized studies on how the intro-
 duction of the SCC affected safety culture. Qualitative interviews among Brazilian nurses sug-
 gest that the checklist was recognized as a quality improvement tool [13] and changed
 routines, but also led to resistance [14]. A pre-post study conducted in Brazil concludes that
 improvements in adherence to essential birth practices and subsequently improved clinical
 outcomes may have been stimulated by context-specific factors such as teamwork, supportive
 leadership, quality improvement climate and indicator-based adjustments [15]. These ele-
 ments, alongside open communication concerning errors, and appropriate workload are con-
 sidered essential in fostering a safety culture [16], but up to this point a causal assessment of
 the SCC on health workers’ perceptions is missing.
 This study aims to address this gap by providing evidence from a cluster-randomized con-
 trolled trial on the SCC’s impact on safety culture. We estimate treatment effects on 14 vari-
 ables measuring the following dimensions of safety culture at the facility (cluster) level: self-
 perceived information access, information transmission, frequency of errors, workload and
 access to resources.
 Additionally, to carve out the causal pathways, we engage into a complier analysis, which
 focuses on those midwives that adhere to the checklist. In other SCC evaluations, compliance
 was measured either in terms of completing single checklist items, certain bundles (e.g.,
 before/after birth) or the full checklists over the total number of checklists provided [17–19],
 over the total number of live births [20], or over mothers admitted [15]. Other studies simply
 asked health care providers whether they carried out essential birth practices outlined in the
 SCC [21] (Abawollo et al. 2021).
 
<section> Materials and methods
 
<section> Ethics
 
<section> Both the ethical board of the Universitas Syiah Kuala, Indonesia, (08/KE/FK/2016) and the
 ethics committee of the University of Göttingen, Germany (June 27, 2016) reviewed the study
 protocol and declared no objection prior to the trial. The research team registered the study
 ISRCTN11041580 and AEARCTR-0003548. The study was supported by the Aceh provincial

<section> health office and the district health offices of Aceh Besar, Banda Aceh, and Bireuen. We col-
 lected informed consent both from facility leadership and the interviewed midwives.
 
<section> Trial setting and participants
 
<section> With a neonatal mortality rate of 34 deaths per 1000 live births, Aceh ranked 19th out of
 provinces in Indonesia [22]. Starting in July 2016, the checklist was implemented in combina-
 tion with a medium-intensity coaching of health workers in the districts of Aceh Besar, Banda
 Aceh, and Bireuen. We chose a clustered design at the facility level to offer a team-based light-
 touch implementation approach, to address the difficulty that births can take place across dif-
 ferent shifts and to avoid spillover effects. Facilities were eligible if they offered at least basic
 emergency obstetric and newborn care services (BEMonC covers provision of oxytocin and
 antibiotics, manual removal of placenta, assisted vaginal delivery, removal of retained prod-
 ucts, resuscitation of the newborn and monitoring of the newborn). BEMonC status was
 assessed via a survey with the head of the delivery room (obstetrician or senior midwife). Out
 of 40 eligible facilities, eight did not participate in the study as they either did not have any
 births during the past month or asked for financial compensation, which we could not provide.
 The sampled facilities (Fig 1) include hospitals, community health centers (puskesmas), and
 midwife clinics. Those facilities have a total yearly volume of around 11,000 births, which
 served as a threshold sample size from power calculations for health outcomes in our accom-
 panying paper [23]. However, we also assessed minimal detectable effect sizes for our safety
 culture measures at baseline (see Table C in S1 Text).
 
<section> and data collection. Note: Authors’ own depiction of randomization process. 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> In collaboration with local midwives, obstetricians, and policymakers, we adapted the checklist
 to the Acehnese context (See Fig A in S1 Text for the adapted checklist and the corresponding
 section for an overview about adaptations). Following the Engage–Launch–Support–Model
 the accompanying Better Birth Trial in India [5], a team of coaches introduced the checklist
 16 health facilities in Indonesia. Since the coaches were responsible for multiple facilities, the
 checklist introduction was spread over several days in October 2016. The trained coaches pro-
 vided motivating arguments and information on correct checklist use during a two-hour
 launch event with midwives and subsequently introduced the SCC. No technical training was
 provided given that the SCC is a reminder of essential practices that are part of the midwives’
 professional education (on average, midwives answered eight out of nine checklist-related
 knowledge questions correctly). Since the checklist takes a reminder function, coaches trained
 midwives to fill out checklist copies during the birth process. Additionally, our team provided
 a checklist poster for the delivery room. In emergencies or when not working in teams (e.g.,
 during night shifts), midwives may have only filled out the paper checklist ex post. Over six
 months, the coaches visited each health facility eleven times to provide new checklist copies,
 collect filled-out SCCs, and provide feedback. The coaching was supported by two meetings
 with the Checklist Quality Coordinator (CQC), a responsible lead person chosen within the
 facility, to exchange best practices (the study protocols and the S1 Text provide a more detailed
 description of the intervention).
 
<section> Trial design/Randomization and masking
 
<section> The research team used an optimization approach to match facilities in two groups [24]. Fol-
 lowing this matching approach, we minimize the mean squared error between the two groups
 on covariates and potential outcomes before treatment. Table A in S1 Text indicates that the
 primary health outcomes and facility characteristics (i.e., facility/health organization types,
 offered services, sampled districts) that are likely to be correlated with individual safety culture
 were balanced at baseline, indicating a successful matching. After allocating two equally sized
 groups of 16 facilities, the research team assigned treatment and control status randomly by
 coin toss; and introduced the treatment subsequently in 16 facilities (50% of the sample) at the
 facility level. Enumerators collected also data in the 16 facilities of the control group to com-
 pare effects of the intervention. Blinding of study participants was not possible.
 
<section> Outcomes and data collection
 
<section> We identify four dimensions of safety culture through which the adoption of the checklist
 could support adherence to essential practices during childbirth. First, by ticking the boxes
 and adding supplementary data, information transmission may be improved for midwives
 working in teams and shifts [25]. Moreover, the checklist may be an empowering point of ref-
 erence to speak up against procedural flaws [4, 26] and to address the global issue of underre-
 porting of mistakes in maternity care [27]. This way, the checklist may improve overall
 information accessibility. Information transmission and access hence refer to appropriate com-
 munication of relevant information and issues related to patient care, working in a well-coor-
 dinated team, access to information on patient medication and diagnosis. Second, the
 checklist is designed as a powerful reminder to recall essential steps during periods of high
 workload and stress like emergencies [28]. Thus, it may reduce the (perceived) frequency of
 errors and, this way, may improve the quality of care. Frequency of errors is measured as errors
 in relation to fatigue, distractions, knowledge and excessive workload. Third, as a job-aid, the
 checklist aims to reduce cognitive load. Nonetheless, the SCC creates further paperwork and 
<section> may reduce health workers’ motivation [11]. Its implications on the (perceived) workload are,
 thus, ambiguous. We measure perceived workload as the burden of paperwork and a rating
 the average workload within the facility. Fourth, the checklist effectiveness crucially depends
 on the availability of complementary supplies [29]. While our intervention did not include a
 provision of supplies, our coaching approach explicitly made midwives aware of insufficient
 supplies and stressed the requirement to demand supplies from district health offices. We
 investigate resource access through inquiring about the adequacy of tools and resources to
 effectively perform duties. For an overview of the survey items please consult Table F in S1
 Text. Given the team-based intervention, we consider our main measures of interest on per-
 ceptions and attitudes for these four dimensions at the cluster level.
 In addition to the checklist intervention, our team collected general information on health
 facilities and patient outcomes at the facility level and health worker characteristics and safety
 culture dimensions at the individual level. The individual questionnaires covered 376 (out of
 623) midwives. We translated all items back and forth and determined the questionnaires’
 context sensitivity via a pre-test. Our main analysis is based on the post-intervention data col-
 lection in April 2017 with data on treatment and control clusters, while we also collected base-
 line information between August and October 2016 (e.g., for matching facilities). Trained
 enumerators collected the data randomly during the shifts of midwives via Computer-Assis-
 ted-Personal-Interviews using Question Pro software. The team recorded the data with anon-
 ymized IDs on the spot. The data was uploaded to a secure server. Data quality was ensured
 through high frequency checks, which specifically consisted of response quality and enumera-
 tor checks. On random occasions, enumerators were accompanied by the survey team to mon-
 itor the interview process. We build on those data to consider our primary outcomes as
 outlined in our trial registration at ISRCTN11041580. Despite the high baseline levels of cer-
 tain outcomes and a potential ceiling effect, we capture sufficient variation to estimate tangible
 effects (see Table C in S1 Text). We lost one control facility and one treatment facility, in both
 cases because they did not have any births during the observation period. As we did not apply
 a pair-wise matching, this attrition did not further affect our analysis.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> We estimate Intention to Treat (ITT) effects using ordinary least squares regressions. The
 basic estimation equation for the Intention to Treat (ITT) effect reads as follows:
 
<section> Y 
<section> � 
<section> ¼ a þ b 
<section> T þ b 
<section> X þ ε
 
<section> i 1 i 2 i I
 
<section> We consider measures of safety culture in the four dimensions information accessibility and
 transmission, perceived frequency of errors, workload, and resource access as primary out-
 comes Y i T i indicates the facility’s treatment status refers to the team-based intervention at the
 facility level; hence, the outcome is the average safety culture at the facility level. X i is a vector
 covariates (facility type, urban-rural, CeMonC-status, district dummy). While we do not need
 to include covariates in the regression due to the randomized study design, we report results
 with covariates to increase statistical efficiency in Table D in S1 Text. ε i is the error term.
 Additionally, we estimate Complier Average Causal Effects (CACE) for the individuals who
 took up the treatment [30]. The CACE estimator predicts compliance with the treatment indi-
 cator in a first stage and consecutively estimates the treatment effect among the compliers in
 second stage (for a more elaborate description of the approach, please see the S1 Text). We
 defined facility’s degree of compliance as a continuous indicator based on the number of com-
 pleted checklists over the total numbers of births. Across intervention facilities, midwives used
 the SCC for 48.6% of births. We estimated both CACE and ITT effects using Stata version

 information transmission, the checklist does not improve coordination and has neither statis-
 tically significant effects on general communication flows nor on reporting. However, both
 the ITT and the CACE, the results show a significant increase in self-reported ease of speaking
 up when noticing patient care issues (row 4). In line with the checklist’s reminder function,
 rows 9–12 indicate a reduction in the frequency of errors, which are, however, only significant

<section> for the reduction of perceived errors during periods of excessive workload (row 12). We also
 consider the effects on perceived workload. Yet, neither perceived paperwork nor general
 workload are affected. To keep implementation costs manageable, we deliberately decided to
 not link the intervention with a provision of additional supplies or training. Yet, our coaching
 provided input on where to access support if needed. Interestingly, there seems to be a per-
 ceived improvement in resource access for the intervention group. We also report results with
 basic covariates (facility type, urban-rural, CEmONC-status, district dummy) in Table D in
 
<section> S1 Text.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> The literature stresses the need for measures to improve the quality of care to achieve the
 health-related SDGs, particularly in resource-constrained settings [1, 31]. Checklists appear
 a particularly suitable tool to improve quality of care in such settings at a comparatively low
 cost. Previous studies indicate promising effects of the SCC on the application of essential
 birth practices [12, 23, 28] and a reduction of stillbirths and neonatal mortality in some con-
 texts—e.g., in Kenya and Uganda [9] or in Rajasthan, India [32]. In contrast, no mortality
 reduction occurred in other settings [28], However, so far there was little evidence why the
 SCC works in one context, but not the other.
 Previous trials suggest low uptake and a tapering out of effects as a potential barrier [23,
 33], which is supported by limited qualitative evidence on health workers’ resistance to the
 change in routines [14]. Thus, it is key to understand the perceptions of midwives to sustain
 checklist use in a more rigorous manner. This study examined in Aceh province, Indonesia,
 how the checklist affects perceptions on safety culture in the four dimensions information
 accessibility and transmission, perceived frequency of errors, workload, and resource access 
<section> primary outcomes. The checklist seems to empower midwives to report issues with patient
 care, which was previously identified by qualitative work as an important issue in the context
 of Aceh [25]. While midwives reported in focus groups that paperwork would be a burden in
 their everyday work [23], the present study’s results suggest that the checklist seems not to con-
 tribute significantly to a perceived increase in workload.
 The checklist further reduces self-perceived errors during periods of high workload. More-
 over, the checklist improves self-perceived availability of supplies, which points to empowering
 effects for midwives to demand necessary resources, given that we did not provide any
 resources ourselves [34]. Such positive effects of the SCC on resource access are particularly
 notable as supplies were a binding constraint for the effectiveness of the SCC in other settings
 [35]. The other dimensions of safety culture remained unaffected.
 This study has some limitations. The sample is relatively small which limits statistical
 power. All outcomes are self-reported and self-perceived measures of providers aggregated at
 the facility level. Self-reported measures might be different, in either direction, from actual
 outcomes. Results are specific to the context of Aceh in Indonesia and lack of external validity
 to other settings might be an even larger concern for outcomes of safety culture than it is any-
 ways for any RCT. Finally, we do not study the impact of safety culture on improved quality
 care at the facilities.
 Future research may want to validate whether the perceived improvements in errors during
 times of high workload and reporting of maltreatment also translates into actual practices, par-
 ticularly if bundled with a modified checklist design or with more comprehensive implementa-
 tion programs [9, 21, 36–38]. Research on safety culture from other implementation sites
 could help to further unravel the mixed results of SCC implementation across contexts and
 take user experiences of health staff into account to continuously improve the tool [39].
