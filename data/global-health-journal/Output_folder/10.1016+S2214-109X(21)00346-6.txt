<section> Introduction
 Typhoid fever, once endemic in high-income countries,
 remains a major public health concern in low-resource
 settings where there is inadequate sanitation and poor
 hygiene conditions, including Nepal. 1–3 More than
 9 million cases of febrile illnesses and 110 000 deaths are
 attributed to typhoid fever each year. 4 South Asia accounts
 for over 70% of the global burden. 1 Growing anti­
 microbial resistance in the region, especially outbreaks
 of cephalosporin-resistant typhoid in Pakistan, poses a
 challenge in the treatment of typhoid fever. 5,6
 Access to clean drinking water, adequate sanitation
 and good hygiene are essential for control of typhoid
 fever, but the substantial costs associated with the
 large infrastructure changes and difficulties in making
 and maintaining behavioural changes in low-resource
 settings has been challenging. Vaccines against typhoid

 Although licensed vaccines are available, their use has
 been limited to travellers. The parenteral Vi polysaccharide
 vaccines are poorly immunogenic in young children. The
 oral Ty21a vaccine is not licensed for children younger
 than 6 years and is difficult for most children to swallow.
 Vi-rEPA, a typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV), showed high
 efficacy in young children; however, never advanced to
 market approval. 9 More recently, a new TCV containing a
 Vi polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus-toxoid protein
 carrier (Typbar-TCV) has shown high immunogenicity
 and the ability to elicit immunological responses in young
 children. 10 In principle, TCVs can elicit a longer duration
 of protection in comparison with polysaccharide
 vaccines. 9 The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts,
 in October, 2017, recommended the use of TCV for the
 control of endemic and epidemic typhoid fever and in

<section> Evidence before this study
 Sciences, Lalitpur, Nepal We searched PubMed for research articles on typhoid conjugate
 
<section> mshakya@oucru.org vaccine efficacy in children published any time before
 April 2, 2020, with no language restriction. We used the search
 terms “typhoid fever”, “conjugate vaccine”, “high burden”, and
 “children”. A randomised, controlled trial of Vi-rEPA, a
 conjugate vaccine containing Vi bound to non-toxic
 recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, done in
 Vietnam in children aged 2–5 years showed a vaccine efficacy of
 over 90% over 27 months of follow-up. The vaccine, however, is
 unavailable in the market.
 
<section> The interim analysis of this study has been published previously
 in which we reported that a single dose of typhoid conjugate
 vaccine (TCV) given to children aged 9 months to younger than
 16 years conferred over 80% protection in the first 12 months
 after vaccination. There are no other published studies showing
 the efficacy of this typhoid conjugate vaccine.
 
<section> We did a phase 3 randomised, controlled trial of a
 single dose of TCV in Lalitpur, Nepal, where typhoid is
 endemic, as a part of the Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration
 Consortium (TyVAC), 12 with the aim of establishing the
 field efficacy of TCV. TyVAC is a partnership between the
 Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at
 the University of Maryland School of Medicine, the
 Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford, and
 PATH, an international non-profit organisation. In 2019,
 we reported the interim results after 1 year of follow-up
 from the ongoing trial. 13 A single dose of TCV had an
 efficacy of 81·6% (95% CI 58·8–91·8; p<0·001) in the
 first year after vaccination. Seroconversion defined as a
 4-fold increase in anti-Vi IgG titres 28 days post-
 vaccination was 99% in the TCV group. We now report
 the final efficacy results after 2 years of follow-up.

<section> Study design and participants
 In this phase 3, double-blind, individually randomised,
 controlled trial in Lalitpur Metropolitan City, an urban
 area within Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, we enrolled
 children aged 9 months to younger than 16 years old.
 Parents or legal guardians provided written informed
 consent before enrolment, and assent was sought from
 children aged 7 years and older. Follow-up of the trial
 participants was planned for a 2-year period until the
 last participant was unmasked. The unmasking process
 started from Jan 20, 2020. Each participant was offered
 the alternative vaccine to the one they previously
 received, and a blood sample was taken in a subset of
 participants. On March 22, 2020, after the government
 of Nepal’s announcement to restrict all unnecessary
 movement of people owing to the COVID-19 pandemic,
 the field activities were stopped and unmasking and
 revaccination could not be completed. The study
 
<section> Added value of this study
 This study shows the protective efficacy of the TCV in children
 over 2 years and supplements the previously reported
 one-year interim results of this study. Additionally, we report
 the immunogenic response to the vaccine up to 18 months
 post-vaccination. The results suggest that a 4-fold increase in
 antibody titre is maintained in a large proportion of the
 children at 18 months.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 The results of the study show that protection is maintained
 with a single dose of typhoid conjugate vaccine protection up
 to 2 years after vaccination. The results support the WHO
 recommendations to vaccinate children in endemic typhoid
 settings. Further data on medium-term to long-term efficacy
 of the vaccine is needed to establish the need for booster
 doses.
 
<section> participants were informed about the suspension of the
 vaccination and will be unmasked and offered vacci­
 nation after the situation improves and in accordance
 with government directives. Unmasking and vaccination
 was resumed from Jan 25, 2021. After being temporarily
 suspended again on April 28, 2021, owing to a second
 wave of COVID-19, the study has again resumed from
 May 27, 2021. Passive surveillance clinics remained
 open for the 2-year period until April 9, 2020, providing
 a full 2 years of follow-up for the primary efficacy
 endpoint.
 The trial was reviewed and approved by the Oxford
 Tropical Research Ethics Committee and the Nepal
 Health Research Council and was done in accordance
 with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The
 protocol has previously been published and the details of
 the inclusion and exclusion criteria are included in the

<section> Randomisation and masking
 Participants were enrolled and randomly assigned during
 the vaccination visit by means of 1:1 stratified block
 randomisation, with random block sizes of 6–12 by
 means of an offline mobile application built for the
 purpose. The participants received a single 25 μg/0·5 mL
 dose of tetanus-toxoid conjugated Vi polysaccharide
 typhoid vaccine (Typbar TCV; Bharat Biotech International,
 India) or meningococcal capsular group A conjugate
 vaccine (MenA; MenAfriVac, Serum Institute of India,
 Pune, India). In addition, from a subgroup of consenting
 participants, 1500 were randomly selected (1000 in the
 TCV group and 500 in the MenA group) for the
 immunogenicity component of the study. Only staff
 administering the vaccine were aware of which vaccine
 was administered and these staff were not involved in the
 follow-up of participants.

<section> the TCV group, 52 (95%) of 55 participants younger
 than 5 years had seroconverted to Vi IgA, 221 (98%)
 of 225 participants aged from 5 to younger than
 10 years had seroconverted to Vi IgA, and 391 (97%)
 of 403 participants aged 10 years and older had
 seroconverted to Vi IgA , whereas by 18 months these
 percentages had dropped to 25 (60%) of 42, 160 (88%)
 of 182, and 294 (93%) of 315, respectively. Similarly, the
 proportion with Vi-IgG seroconversion at day 28 was
 54 (98%) of 55 for participants aged less than 5 years,
 225 (100%) of 225 for those aged from 5 to younger
 than 10 years, and 342 (100%) of 343 for those aged
 10 years and older in the TCV group, and remained
 high at 55 (95%) of 58, 202 (97%) of 209, and 316 (95%)
 of 334 by 18 months, respectively.
 The anti-Vi IgG and anti-Vi IgA response according to
 sex are presented in the appendix (pp 10–13). The geometric
 mean concentration of anti-Vi IgA at 18 months was 19·70
 (95% CI 17·30–22·43) ELISA units (EU) per mL in males
 and 26·96 (95% CI 23·56–30·86) in females. Males had a
 25·20-fold (95% CI 21·28–29·12) increase in anti-Vi IgA
 titre and a 60·80-fold (95% CI 52·26−69·35) increase in
 anti-Vi IgG titre whereas females had a 29·93-fold (95% CI
 25·46–34·40) increase in anti-Vi IgA titre and 74·60-fold
 (95% CI 63·31–85·89) increase in anti-Vi IgG titre.
 Females had significantly higher titre at 18 months
 (p=0·0016 for anti-Vi IgA and p=0·0080 for anti-Vi IgG)
 and significantly higher fold increase in anti-Vi IgA
 (p=0·033) and the anti-Vi IgG titres (p=0·031) from day 0 to
 18 months post-vaccination in the TCV group.
 The number of fever presentations at the study clinics
 and the self-reported fevers from follow-up phone calls,
 and the corresponding vaccine efficacies is shown in the
 appendix (p 14). There were 2352 fever cases in the TCV
 group and 2366 fever cases in the MenA group, which
 met the study criteria for blood culture and presented to
 the study clinics (vaccine efficacy 0·5%, 95% CI
 −5·3 to 6·1; p=0·85), of which 417 in the TCV group
 compared with 415 in the MenA group were clinically
 suspected to be typhoid fever (vaccine efficacy −0·5%,
 95% CI −15·4 to 12·4; p=0·94). There were 4816 self-
 reported febrile episodes in the TCV group and 4766 in
 the MenA group (vaccine efficacy −1·1%, 95% CI
 −5·3 to 2·9%; p=0·59). The median duration of fever per
 episode was 3·0 days (IQR 2–4) in both groups. A total of
 31 fever episodes were self-reported as clinically diagnosed
 typhoid in the TCV group, whereas 71 were reported in
 the MenA group (vaccine efficacy 56·3%, 95% CI
 32·5–72·3; p<0·0001).
 A total of 149 children self-reported to be admitted
 to hospital in the TCV group compared with 141 in
 the MenA group (vaccine efficacy −5·7%, 95% CI
 −34·1 to 16·6; p=0·64; appendix p 16). Both groups self-
 reported 5 days (IQR 3–7) of hospital stay. There were
 eight deaths, three in the TCV group and five in the
 MenA group over the study period. None of the deaths
 were vaccine-related (appendix p 18).
 
<section> The self-reported days missed from school and work
 are shown in the appendix (pp 16–17). There were
 1928 children who missed school in the TCV group
 compared with 1859 children in the MenA group, both
 groups with a median 4 days (IQR 2–7) of missed school.
 Among those self-reporting typhoid fever, there were
 28 episodes in the TCV group and 61 episodes in the
 MenA group with median 10 days (IQR 5–14·5) and
 10 days (IQR 6–15) of school missed, respectively.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> Among a cohort of Nepali children, the protective
 efficacy of single dose TCV against blood culture-
 positive typhoid fever in 2 years post-vaccination is
 similar to that reported in the interim efficacy analysis
 (vaccine efficacy 81·6%, 95% CI 58·8–91·8; p<0·001).
 There was also no significant difference in the vaccine
 efficacy during the first 12 months of follow-up versus
 thereafter. The vaccine efficacy is also similar to
 seroefficacy estimates (vaccine efficacy 85%, 95% CI
 80–88) from a phase 3 immunogenicity trial in India.
 Immunogenicity of TCV was robust in this population.
 Our results showed a 99% seroconversion of anti-Vi IgG
 antibodies and a 97% seroconversion of anti-Vi IgA
 antibodies at day 28. Similar anti-Vi IgG immune
 responses to TCV have previously been reported in studies
 from Vietnam and India. 9,10 In a study evaluating the
 antibody response to Vi-polysaccharide and Vi-conjugate
 vaccines in a typhoid fever controlled human infection
 model, there were high anti-Vi IgG and IgA responses to
 TCV, and anti-Vi IgA antibodies were associated with
 protection in individuals who received TCV. 16 Further,
 sustained 95% and 89% seroconversion at 18 months
 shows persistence of immunological responses.
 There were significant differences in the increase in
 anti-Vi IgG and IgA titres from baseline to day 28 as well
 as from baseline to 18 months post-vaccination across
 age groups, with the increse being lowest in the youngest
 age group. There was no significant difference in efficacy
 between the 2 to younger than 5 year and 5 year and
 older age groups or by time since vaccination. The
 presence of comparatively high titre of antibodies at
 baseline in the older age groups is suggestive of
 environmental exposure to typhoid and, as a result, some
 degree of pre-existing protective immunity against the
 disease. This might imply that some of the differences in
 antibody titres by age result from boosting of pre-existing
 immunity rather than immaturity of the immune
 response in younger age groups. It has been suggested
 that infants produce lower and less persistent antibodies
 in response to T-cell dependent protein or conjugate
 vaccines, and maternal antibodies might suppress the
 response to vaccination, which could explain the results.
 However, a cluster randomised trial done in Dhaka,
 Bangladesh has shown high immunogenic response in
 children younger than 2 years, 18 This result suggests that
