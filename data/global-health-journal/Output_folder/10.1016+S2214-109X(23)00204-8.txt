<section> Summary
 
<section> Background In high transmission settings, most school-aged children harbour malaria parasites without showing
 symptoms, often leading to anaemia and possibly impaired psychomotor and cognitive abilities. We aimed to assess
 the effectiveness and safety of intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in school-aged children (IPTsc) living in
 
<section> highly endemic areas.
 
<section> Methods We did an open-label randomised controlled trial in seven primary schools in northeastern Tanzania.
 Schoolchildren aged 5–15 years were individually randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine,
 artesunate–amodiaquine, or standard of care (control) using a balanced block design. Drugs were administered by
 schoolteachers, with supervision from study nurses, at months 0 (baseline), 4, and 8, and were given in line with
 manufacturer’s recommendations with dose based on the child’s bodyweight. The primary endpoints were change
 from baseline in mean haemoglobin concentration at months 12 and 20, and clinical incidence of malaria and
 prevalence of parasitaemia at months 12 and 20 in the intervention groups versus the control group. The outcome data
 were collected through longitudinal surveys conducted every 4 months. Data were analysed on the basis of intention to
 treat (including all randomised participants) and per protocol (comprising children who completed the full 3-day
 regimen of all three IPTsc treatment rounds as assigned). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03640403).
 
<section> Findings Of the 1797 children scheduled for clinical screening, 1566 were enrolled and randomly allocated (526 to receive
 dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, 527 to receive artesunate–amodiaquine, and 513 to receive standard of care). Due to
 COVID-19-related school closures, only two schools were visited at month 12 (135 children in the dihydroartemisinin–
 piperaquine group, 131 in the artesunate–amodiaquine group, and 118 in the control group). At month 12, compared
 with the control group, the change from baseline in mean haemoglobin concentration was increased by 0·5 g/dL (95% CI
 0·2 to 0·8; p<0·0001) in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group and 0·5 g/dL (0·2 to 0·7; p=0·0020) in the
 artesunate–amodiaquine group in the intention-to-treat analysis (with similar findings in the per protocol analysis). In
 the same period, in the intention-to-treat analysis, the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia increased from 28·5% (138 of
 485 participants) to 33·6% (39 of 116) in the control group, but decreased from 28·0% (139 of 497) to 12·0% (15 of 125)
 in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (–21·6 percentage points [95% CI –31·9 to –11·3], p=0·0001 vs control at
 month 12) and from 24·7% (124 of 502) to 16·0% (20 of 125) in the artesunate–amodiaquine group (–17·6 percentage
 points [–28·4 to –6·9], p=0·0015). The decrease for artesunate–amodiaquine was larger in the per protocol analysis
 (–25·3 percentage points [–36·3 to –14·2], p<0·0001). The protective effect of IPTsc against malaria parasitaemia was
 64% (95% CI 39 to 79; p<0·0001) for dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and 52% (23 to 70; p=0·0015) for artesunate–
 amodiaquine in the intention-to-treat analysis, and was slightly higher on per protocol analysis. The protective effect
 against clinical malaria at month 12 was 20% (95% CI 9 to 29; p=0·0002) for dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and 19%
 (8 to 28; p=0·0004) for artesunate–amodiaquine. No significant differences in any primary outcomes between the
 intervention and control groups were noted at month 20. Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and artesunate–amodiaquine
 were associated with a small number of mild adverse events, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events
 
<section> or deaths.
 
<section> Interpretation IPTsc with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine or artesunate–amodiaquine is a safe and effective approach
 to reducing malaria parasitaemia, clinical malaria, and related morbidities, and is feasible to implement through

<section> Introduction
 According to the WHO malaria report 2022, the WHO
 African Region had an estimated 234 million cases of
 malaria in 2021, which accounted for about 95% of global
 malaria cases. Compared with other age groups, school-
 aged children (5–15 years) have a high prevalence of
 malaria in most endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa. 2–5
 In most cases, these children remain asymptomatic,
 which makes them susceptible to anaemia and impaired
 cognitive ability. 4,6 Reduced haemoglobin concentrations
 are often a consequence of long durations of infection or
 recurrent malaria episodes, both of which have been
 associated with increased gametocyte production 8 that
 continues to propagate transmission. Control strategies
 rely mainly on insecticide-treated nets and effective case
 management with artemisinin combination therapies.
 However, studies show low use of bednets in school-aged
 
<section> Research in context
 
<section> Evidence before this study
 Before our study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-
 analysis to explore the correlation between the malaria parasite
 carriage in pregnant women and school-aged children living in
 similar malaria-endemic settings of sub-Saharan Africa. We
 searched the Malaria in Pregnancy Library, PubMed, Cochrane
 Library, and Web of Science to include studies indexed or
 published until Dec 10, 2018. Combinations of the following
 search terms were used: “children” OR “pregnant women” AND
 “malaria” OR “Plasmodium falciparum” AND “prevalence” AND
 “Africa”. No language or date restrictions were applied to this
 search. We updated our search to March 31, 2023, by searching
 PubMed for review articles with the main search terms “malaria
 prevalence OR burden AND school aged children AND Africa”,
 with no language or date restrictions. Studies showed that
 most school-aged children (aged 5–15 years) in high
 transmission settings harbour malaria parasites without
 showing symptoms, which makes them susceptible to anaemia
 and impaired cognitive ability. School-aged children were twice
 as likely to carry malaria parasites as were pregnant women
 living in the same community, and there was a strong linear
 correlation between the prevalence of malaria infection in
 school-aged children and pregnant women (r=0·93, p<0·0001).
 Despite children being at high risk, with strong correlation to
 that in their surrounding community, school-aged children still
 lack targeted interventions tailored to them. Systematic
 reviews by Cohee and colleagues (2020) and Matangila and
 colleagues (2015) have shown that intermittent preventive
 treatment for malaria in school-aged children (IPTsc) is an
 effective tool to reduce malaria and malaria-related anaemia.
 These findings support the hypothesis that clearing otherwise
 untreated, asymptomatic infections might provide a window of
 opportunity for haematological recovery by decreasing the rate
 of destruction and removal of parasitised red blood cells and

<section> children; 5 thus, a targeted chemopreventive treatment
 could be a better option for this age group.
 Clearing otherwise-untreated asymptomatic infections
 might provide a window for haematological recovery by
 decreasing the rate of destruction and removal of
 parasitised erythrocyte and improving the erythrocyte
 production rate in the bone marrow. 6 Artemisinin
 combination therapies are highly effective against the
 pathogenic asexual parasite stages and immature
 gametocytes, resulting in a substantial reduction of post-
 treatment malaria transmission compared with non-
 artemisinin regimens. 9 Several studies have shown
 intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in school-
 aged children (IPTsc) to be a feasible and effective
 tool 10,11 to prevent clinical malaria and reduce malaria
 parasitaemia and anaemia in schoolchildren. However,
 there is still little evidence on the optimal drug and
 improving the erythrocyte production rate in the bone marrow.
 However, the optimal drug regimen or schedule for IPTsc has
 not been established, and most studies have advocated for the
 use of non-artemisinin combination therapies for IPTsc. In
 addition, the feasibility of using schoolteachers to implement
 IPTsc has been minimally investigated.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 We conducted a study with a pragmatic design to mimic how
 IPTsc could be implemented in Tanzania. We chose
 artemisinin combination therapy drugs that were registered
 and used as alternatives to first-line regimens in Tanzanian
 malaria diagnostics and treatment guidelines, meaning that
 these drugs were well known and had good safety profiles
 from a regulatory perspective. We used schoolteachers to
 administer IPTsc, a strategy that was deemed feasible and
 effective. We chose a schedule that would provide maximum
 protective benefit as it mimicked malaria seasonality in the
 study area. Our design included a second year with no
 intervention, in which we found no rebound effect, although
 the benefits obtained in the interventional year disappeared,
 highlighting a need for sustained IPTsc intervention to
 maintain the gains in the long term and protect subsequent
 cohorts.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 WHO’s 2023 guidelines for malaria recommend the use of IPTsc
 in malaria-endemic settings with moderate to high perennial or
 seasonal transmission to reduce disease burden. Our findings
 provide further field-based evidence that malaria control
 programmes should consider implementing IPTsc. Use of
 schoolteachers was feasible for IPTsc programmatic
 implementation and possible integration, as schoolteachers are
 already used to deliver school-based mass anthelmintic drug
 administration and nutritional programmes.

 as prevalence, mean difference, and protective effect. As
 done previously, 22 protective effect was calculated as
 1 − (rate ratio [of malaria parasitaemia, clinical malaria,
 or anaemia]) × 100%. Kaplan–Meier analysis was
 used to estimate time to first episode of clinical malaria.
 95% CIs were calculated for all outcome of interest
 using the linear mixed model, and p<0·05 was
 considered statistically significant when comparing
 dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine or artesunate–amodia­
 quine with control, whereas a p<0·025 was considered
 significant when comparing dihydroartemisinin–
 piperaquine with artesunate–amodiaquine (presented
 in appendix 2). Data were analysed on the basis See

 The survival estimates were significantly higher in
 the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and artesunate–
 amodiaquine groups than in the control group after three
 rounds of IPTsc (up to month 12; log-rank p<0·0001;
 figure 3A). However, there was no effect noted in the non-
 interventional year (months 12–20; log-rank p=0·5709;
 figure 3B). Further analysis using Cox regression is
 described in appendix 2 (p 9).
 At month 12, compared with the control group,
 the difference in prevalence of anaemia in the dihydro­
 artemisinin–piperaquine group was non-significant in
 the intention-to-treat analysis (–9·8 percentage points
 [95% CI –22·0 to 2·4], p=0·1181) and per protocol analysis
 (–9·3 [–22·2 to 3·7], p=0·1644), whereas the artesunate–
 amodiaquine group showed a significant reduction in
 the intention-to-treat analysis (–19·0 percentage points
 
<section> [–31·2 to –6·7], p=0·0028) and per protocol analysis
 (–20·4 percentage points [–33·3 to –7·5], p=0·0024;
 table 3). The protective effect of IPTsc against anaemia
 following three rounds (month 12) of dihydroartemisinin–
 piperaquine medication was not significant (16% [95% CI
 –5 to 33], p=0·1181), whereas artesunate–amodiaquine
 showed protective effect of 32% (12 to 47; p=0·0028) at the
 same timepoint in the intention-to-treat analysis
 (appendix 2 p 7). Based on artesunate–amodiaquine being
 administered three times per year, the NNT to prevent
 one case of anaemia was 5 (95% CI 3–15; p=0028;
 intention-to-treat analysis). There were no significant
 effects on anaemia at months 16 and 20, when no
 medications were provided (appendix 2 pp 7, 21).
 In the linear mixed regression model, there was no
 significant effect of IPTsc on cognitive or psychomotor
 function (appendix 2 p 10). However, on multivariate
 analysis (appendix 2 p 10), boys had significantly higher
 mean cognitive scores (2·8 [95% CI 0·2–5·4], p=0·0401)
 than girls at all timepoints. Likewise, psychomotor
 function was associated with older age, male sex, and
 number of successive visits. Boys had higher mean
 VO max scores (5·2 [95% CI 4·2–6·2], p<0·0001)
 than girls at all assessment time points, unrelated to the
 IPTsc intervention. On per protocol analysis, increased
 haemoglobin concentration was associated with an
 increase in unadjusted VO max at a coefficient of 0·5
 (95% CI 0·0–1·0; p=0·0470).
 On drug administration days, 30 adverse events
 were recorded in the intervention groups (16 in the
 dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group and 14 in the
 artesunate–amodiaquine group), all of which were mild,
 except for one case of skin rash that was deemed
 moderate (appendix 2 p 12). These events were deemed
 to be drug-related and were expected on the basis of
 drug packet inserts. During the follow-up period, we
 recorded five serious adverse events unrelated to the
 study drugs: three in the control group (two cases
 of severe malaria and one case of septicaemia), one
 in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (herbal
 intoxication), and one in the artesunate–amodiaquine
 group (severe malaria). All participants recovered well,
 except for one child in the control group, who had two
 serious adverse events (severe malaria) on separate
 occasions, and died after the second episode due to
 severe anaemia, possibly secondary to severe malaria. All
 events were reported to the Medical Research
 Coordination Committee and to the Tanzania Medicines
 and Medical Devices Authority.
 Compliance with prescribed medication was
 satisfactory as trained schoolteachers provided medi­
 cation under direct observation at schools. Children who
 did not attend school on the dosing day were followed up
 at home to administer medication. Over the course of

 used as first-line treatment in that country has been
 suggested. 10 A drug combination with longer half-life,
 such as dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, could provide
 prolonged protection, as suggested in previous studies.
 The ideal situation would be the use of a single-dose
 drug, but none of the currently licensed or marketed
 drug have this property., Development of a new drug or
 formulation with such a property would take time,
 while the need for IPTsc remains eminent. Whichever
 regimens are used, continuous monitoring of drug
 resistance molecular markers will be required (eg, using
 samples from the school malaria parasitological surveys)
 as an integral part of intervention deployment plans.
 IPTsc showed no significant effect on cognitive or
 psychomotor functions in the current study, which might
 be due to an insufficient sample size to provide power to
 detect differences between study groups. Other studies
 have shown an effect of IPTsc on cognitive and
 psychomotor function using similar or different testing
 tools. 6,18 However, previously used tests were not exactly
 the same as the one used in this study (cognitive score
 scale of 20 vs 40 in our study). Our results showed that
 psychomotor function was significantly associated with
 haemoglobin increase (on per protocol analysis), which
 was in line with other studies. 6,18
 One limitation of our study was the interruption of
 visit 4 (an important outcome assessment visit) due to the
 COVID-19 pandemic, when only two schools were visited
 before closures occurred. This interruption affected
 the assessment of primary objective on change in
 haemoglobin after three rounds of IPTsc (at month 12),
 although the sample size had sufficient power (80%) to
 detect the differences observed. The overall percentage of
 missed visits was low at around 19%, and there were no
 significant differences in baseline characteristics between
 those lost to follow-up and those who were followed up or
 in loss to follow-up between study groups, suggesting
 that the treatment effects were not caused by sampling
 bias. In addition, the study design including individual
 randomisation and linear mixed model analysis was
 robust enough to ascertain the effect of IPTsc on an
 individual participant level in each study group.
 A comparison of participant characteristics between
 five schools not visited and the two schools visited
 at month 12 showed some differences (eg, in baseline
 prevalence of anaemia [57% vs 28%], malaria prevalence
 
<section> [26% vs 32%], history of malaria in the past month
 
<section> [32% vs 22%], and nutritional status; appendix 2 p 4). The
 individual randomisation with a balanced block approach
 ensured each school had balanced study groups and the
 study outcome focused on differences at the individual
 subject level per group. In addition, after adjusting
 for factors that differed between study groups (eg,
 socioeconomic status or weight-for-age Z score), the
 observed effect of IPTsc on change in haemoglobin
 concentration and malaria prevalence remained
 essentially the same (appendix 2 pp 13–22). The clinical
 malaria incidence data were compensatory as most cases
 were recorded by local health workers even during
 COVID-19-related school closures. Another limitation is
 that we were unable to do an extensive battery of cognitive
 tests for possible comparison with a variety of studies that
 used different kinds of cognitive tests, and repeated use
 of the same cognitive test at multiple timepoints meant
 that improved performance was inevitable across all study
 groups (ie, participants knew what to expect). We collected
 data on school academic performance and absenteeism
 that will be available in a separate publication.
 In conclusion, our findings provide additional evidence
 that implementation of IPTsc should be considered
 as an important intervention within malaria control
 programmes, as recommended by WHO’s 2023 guidelines
 for malaria, 28 to reduce the malaria burden in school-
 aged children in whom malaria parasitaemia is prevalent
 in most malaria-endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa,
 thereby shrinking the reservoir and reducing malaria and
 anaemia in those communities. For easier implementation,
 we suggest that IPTsc be sustained and integrated into
 school-based health programmes (as is currently done for
 nutrition and mass anthelmintic drug administration), to
 increase the benefit of anaemia reduction.
