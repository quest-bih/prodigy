 Accepted 24 November 2017 Results There was no improvement in BP control among
 users of intervention clinics as compared with control
 clinics. However, the LHWs improved clinic functioning,

 including rapidly increasing number of users of chronic
 care, unreliable BP machines and cuffs, intermittent drug
 shortages and insufficient space.

 treatment programme, 2 but hypertension,
 which is more prevalent than HIV, is poorly
 managed with low levels of awareness and
 control. 3 4 In the Agincourt Health and
 Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS)
 site, based in rural north-east South Africa,
 around 57% of the adult population have
 high blood pressure (BP), but the condition
 is appropriately managed in less than 10%.
 Primary healthcare clinics in South Africa
 are responsible for case finding, treatment
 and adherence support for patients with
 chronic diseases. In an effort to provide inte-
 grated care for the large number of patients
 with chronic disease, services have recently
 been reorganised with appointment sched-
 uling, preappointment retrieval of files and
 preparing medication prior to the patient’s
 appointment. 6–8 The aim is to speed the
 journey for chronic patients through the
 clinic, improving efficiency, while ensuring
 chronic conditions are effectively controlled.
 A recently published review of these changes
 showed that nurses were struggling to
 carry out these tasks in addition to clinic
 consultations.
 Task shifting has been an important
 strategy in the provision of care for patients
 with HIV and TB. 10 Lay counsellors provide
 counselling and testing services, 11–14 and lay
 health workers (LHW) provide adherence
 support. 15–17 We hypothesised that LHWs
 would be able to assist clinic staff with the
 administrative and education aspects of the
 newly reorganised integrated chronic care,
 allowing the nurses to focus on the clinical
 consultations and hence leading to improve
 health outcomes. In this paper, we report the
 results of a parallel cluster randomised trial 
<section> Key questions
 
<section> What is already known about this topic?
 
<section> ► Systematic reviews have provided evidence of the effectiveness
 of lay health workers (LHW) in improving access to care, the
 quality of care, including screening for cardiovascular risk factors,
 reducing systolic blood pressure (BP), fasting blood glucose and
 weight, as part of community-based care.
 
<section> ► While there is systematic review of studies looking at the effect
 of task shifting, the focus was shifting prescribing from doctors to
 nurses, we found no trials looking at LHWs’ role in the provision of
 clinic-based integrated chronic care.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► The Nkateko study was the first randomised controlled trial to
 assess the role of LHWs in the provision of integrated chronic care.
 
<section> ► While we found no improvement in BP control, the LHWs improved
 clinic attendance.
 
<section> ► A large and increasing numbers of patients, the dominance of
 the vertically funded HIV programme and the poor standards of
 equipment in clinics compromised the quality of clinical care
 provided by nurses.
 
<section> ► Assistance from LHWs with booking appointments, sending
 reminders, prepacking medication and providing health education
 was insufficient to improve BP control in this environment.
 
<section> Recommendations for policy
 
<section> ► Our results, taken together with the existing evidence, suggest
 that LHWs can play an important role in supporting the provision of
 integrated chronic care.
 
<section> ► However, adding additional human resources (even if readily
 available and relatively inexpensive) is unlikely to have an
 effect on health outcomes, without the necessary equipment to
 accurately measure BP, and sufficient clinical staff to
 treat the growing numbers of chronic patients.
 
<section> which tested a clinic-level intervention, shifting tasks
 from nurses to LHWs. We aimed to improve the manage-
 ment of chronic conditions, specifically the management
 of hypertension.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study setting
 
<section> The trial was based in Bushbuckridge subdistrict in
 Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, where the MRC/
 Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions
 Research Unit has been running the Agincourt HDSS
 since 1992. 18 The Agincourt HDSS, covering an area of
 450 km , includes 115 000 individuals living in approxi-
 mately 20 000 households distributed in 32 villages. The
 area has high unemployment with more than 50% of
 men (aged between 25 and 54 years old) and more than
 20% of women (25–49 years old) migrating to urban
 areas for work for part of the year. 19 Infrastructure has
 improved in the last few years, but there is still irregular
 water supply, electricity is unaffordable for many, and the
 schools and health facilities do not provide services of
 adequate quality.
 
<section> Ten primary healthcare facilities and three hospitals
 that are 25–60 km away from the site serve the local popu-
 lation. The Department of Health piloted the provision
 of integrated chronic disease care (ICDM) in the Bush-
 buckridge subdistrict, 2 years prior to the start of this
 study. It has since been rolled out to other provinces.
 
<section> Study design, randomisation and blinding
 The study was a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled
 trial with repeated cross-sectional surveys. 20 21 Each
 cluster was one clinic together with the population that
 it served. Clinics were included if they were located in
 the site, rather than on the periphery, and if the clinic
 manager consented to participate in the study (figure 1).
 A clinic located out of the study site was chosen as a pilot
 site, to learn lessons about implementing the interven-
 tion prior to establishing it in the trial sites. Simple 1:1
 random allocation of the eight clinics was carried out
 at a public meeting in the presence of clinic staff and
 community members. Clinics’ names in sealed envelopes
 were drawn from a box by a community member. This
 transparent process facilitated understanding and trust
 in the randomisation. It was not possible to blind clinic
 staff or patients to the allocation. However, the primary
 outcome was measured using an encrypted data set, with
 no indication of which arm received the intervention.
 
<section> Usual care in the study site
 On attending a clinic, each patient is assigned to one of
 two queues, one for patients with an ongoing chronic
 condition, another for the remaining patients. After
 obtaining his/her file, each patient has their temper-
 ature, pulse, weight and BP measured at a ‘vital signs’
 station. This is usually carried out by a junior (enrolled)
 nurse, before the patient is seen by a professional nurse,
 who diagnoses, prescribes and dispenses medication in a
 designated chronic care consultation room. The opera-
 tion of the separate chronic disease pathway depends on
 sufficient staff and equipment to maintain two vital signs
 stations (one for each queue), to carry out the additional
 tasks (preappointment retrieval of files, appointment
 scheduling and predispensing of medication), and that
 patients come within a few days of their appointed day,
 otherwise prepacked medication has to be unpacked.
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> The intervention consisted of two LHWs assigned to each
 clinic to support nurses in the management of patients
 with chronic disease. The LHWs, selected from the local
 community, had completed their secondary education
 but had had little further education. They were trained
 and supervised by an implementation manager, who was
 a local primary healthcare nurse, with a training quali-
 fication. As part of the pragmatic design, the staff and
 supervisors of intervention clinics were able to decide
 which tasks the LHWs should do. All the intervention
 clinics chose to have the LHWs assisting with booking
 appointments, retrieving and filing patient files, and

<section> providing health education (on adherence and lifestyle).
 They also all chose to have the LHWs taking measure-
 ments in the vital signs queue and assisting the nurses
 with the prepacking of medications. Some clinics strug-
 gled to find space for these activities to take place, so the
 LHWs often had to operate in the corridor or the recep-
 tion area. In addition, the LHWs phoned or sent a text
 message to patients with hypertension to remind them
 of their appointment. The implementation manager
 ensured fidelity to the planned intervention. The four
 control clinics continued working as normal and the
 implementation manager did not visit them or interact
 with their staff to avoid contamination.
 In the first months of the intervention, the implementa-
 tion manager found that none of the intervention clinics
 had cuffs in good repair for the electronic BP machines.
 Without the possibility of correctly measuring BP the
 intervention had little chance to be effective. Thus,
 although this was a pragmatic trial, we decided that it
 was necessary to replace the cuffs. To keep the compar-
 ison meaningful, we provided both the intervention and
 control clinics with two new sets of cuffs. We originally
 planned the intervention to last for 15 months, but after
 having replaced the cuffs, we extended the intervention
 period for a further 3 months, up to 18 months in total.
 
<section> Primary and secondary outcomes
 Our primary outcome was based on the South African
 guidelines for the management of hypertension, which
 call for a focus on people at moderate or greater cardi-
 ovascular risk. 22 The primary outcome is defined as the
 difference (between intervention and control clinics)
 in the change of the proportion of the population who
 have uncontrolled hypertension together with a risk
 profile indicating at least moderate risk of cardiovascular
 disease (CVD). 20 We did not have the resources to make
 the clinical diagnoses called for in the guidelines and
 used proxy measures for some items. For example, we
 collected data on self-reported stroke rather than making
 a diagnosis, and we used waist circumference as a proxy
 measure of obesity. The participants whose data were
 used to calculate the outcome measures were the self-de-
 fined users of one of the eight clinics. As there were no
 records of who attended a clinic, and individuals are free
 to attend any clinic they choose, we asked respondents

<section> which was their usual clinic and which clinic they visited
 last. For the large majority of respondents the usual clinic
 was the same as the last clinic. We used the usual clinic for
 the analysis of the primary outcome.
 Our secondary outcomes are listed in box 1. The
 first five were derived from the two population surveys,
 while the last two came from the data we collected from
 patients as they entered the clinics, and from their clinic
 files. Data for the fifth outcome were not collected, as the
 time frame of 1 year was omitted from the survey ques-
 tionnaire. There was some delay in setting up the system
 for collecting clinic data; as a result, the last two outcomes
 are reported for the period May 2014 to July 2015.
 
<section> Baseline and end of intervention cross-sectional surveys
 For the two surveys, a separate random weighted sample of
 people over 18 years was drawn from the Agincourt census
 database with no knowledge of which, if any, clinic individ-
 uals used. In the first survey, no other eligibility criterion was
 used. In the second survey, we excluded from the sampling
 frame individuals who had recently been randomly selected
 to participate in another research study that demanded a lot
 of participants’ time. The sample was weighted to provide
 larger numbers of older people, who could be expected
 to have a higher prevalence of hypertension. Informed
 consent was sought from each participant and refusals are
 
<section> reported in figure
 Fieldworkers were trained for 2 weeks before the survey.
 As the fieldworkers lived in the community it was not
 possible to blind them to which clinics received the inter-
 vention. However, they had no involvement in either the
 implementation or the process evaluation. The question-
 naire was piloted in advance. Quality control included
 three stages in the first survey: a supervisor checked
 the completed questionnaires in the field; the project
 manager checked them as he filed them in the office; and
 the data manager checked them prior to data entry. In
 the second survey, we included an additional check of a
 random 5% of interviews for which a supervisor returned
 to the household a few days later and reinterviewed the
 participant to confirm responses to some selected ques-
 tions. A double entry data system was used and a data
 manager made the comparison of the two entries and
 corrected those where there was a discrepancy using the
 paper questionnaire as a reference.
 The questionnaire included self-reported history of
 hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart failure, angina and
 heart attacks, smoking, clinic use (last and usual) and
 family history of CVD. We did not attempt to measure the
 number of cigarettes smoked as regular heavy smoking
 is unusual in this cash-poor community. Information on
 age, gender, marital status, education and socioeconomic
 status was drawn from the census database.
 
<section> Variable measurement and definitions
 Pulse, systolic and diastolic BP was measured three times
 in a seated position after 5 min of rest and with 2 min
 interval using the OMRON M6W automated cuff (Omron,
 Kyoto, Japan). Waist circumference was measured using
 a flexible tape measure (SECA). A finger prick was used
 to measure random blood glucose (CareSens N Monitor)
 and total cholesterol (CardioChek PA Silver version).
 We derived the mean systolic and diastolic BP using the
 average of the second and third BP measurements. We
 defined diabetes as a random glucose measure of over
 11 mmol/L. A person with a random glucose measure
 between 7 and 11 mmol/L, and who reported that they
 had not eaten for 12 hours, was recorded as having high
 blood glucose. The remaining respondents were consid-
 ered not to be diabetic. We defined obesity as a waist
 circumference greater than 94 cm in men or greater than
 80 cm in women.
 We estimated the time that patients spent in the
 clinics by calculating the difference between the time
 the patients reported arriving at the clinics and the time
 of the exit interviews, as described under the Process
 evaluation section.
 
<section> Clinic activity data
 To collect data on clinic activity, an experienced data entry
 clerk sat with a laptop in each control and intervention clinic
 for the period of the intervention. A unique record using
 identifiers (ID numbers, cellphone, date of birth, gender,
 village of residence and the name of another person in the
 household) was created for each consenting individual, and
 the date of visit, diagnosis and date of return visit were then
 collected from the clinic records for this and all subsequent
 visits by that individual.
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> We derived our assumptions for the sample size calcula-
 tion from data collected in the same site in 2010. 24 We
 adopted the use of the coefficient of variation (SD of
 the cluster means divided by the overall mean) as used 
<section> Figure 2 Response to survey by individuals sampled.
 
<section> in similar study settings when we cannot get a good
 intracluster variation 25–27 and assumed that the coeffi-
 cient of variation would be similar in the two groups
 and that effects of the interventions would be similar
 across clusters. We used a background prevalence of
 36% and a coefficient of variation of 0.132 (95% CI
 0.087 to 0.177). We assumed that the two population
 surveys would each include at least 4000 participants,
 with approximately 500 people in each of the eight
 clusters. We estimated that we would have 88% power
 to detect a reduction of 11% (from 36% to 25%) in
 people at moderate or greater cardiovascular risk.
 
<section> Statistical methods
 Sociodemographic and clinical information including
 both primary and secondary outcomes was summarised
 using frequencies and summary measures. Continuous
 variables such as age and BP levels were summarised
 using the mean and SD. Categorical variables such as
 gender were described through frequency tabulations
 by reporting the relative percentage and the number of
 observations (%, n).
 The analysis of the primary outcome was conducted
 to test the difference in the change in the proportions
 with moderate or greater added risk of CVD in the 
<section> intervention and control clusters. We used the cluster
 adjusted Pearson’s χ 2 to adjust for clustering for each
 group. This analysis was carried out in EXCEL with user
 written commands. All other analyses were done using
 STATA V.14 (StataCorp, 2015. Stata Statistical Software:
 Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp) and statis-
 tical significance was considered at 5% level.
 We included the following sensitivity analyses for the
 primary outcome: (A) an analysis which included those
 who did not name any specific drugs when reporting on
 hypertensive drugs (in the primary analysis these indi-
 viduals were not included as having hypertension); (B)
 an analysis using the ‘last’ clinic rather than the ‘usual’
 clinic to assign individuals to clinics; (C) an analysis using
 two-stage regression modelling instead of the adjusted χ ;
 and (D) an analysis using mixed effects model adjusting
 for covariates. Secondary outcomes were analysed in the
 same way as the primary outcome. No sensitivity analyses
 were conducted.
 
<section> Process evaluation
 We conducted a theory-driven, mixed methods eval-
 uation to understand the causal processes that led to
 change (or not). 20 We observed clinic activity, the move-
 ment of patients along the clinic pathway and patient
 consultations over a period of 3–9 days at 6-month inter-
 vals (control and intervention) during the 18-month
 intervention period. We conducted brief exit interviews
 with the patients as they left the clinic (n=703). We
 also conducted bimonthly interviews with the LHWs
 throughout the intervention, as well as interviews with
 clinic staff, and clinic and district managers.
 The clinic managers of all the clinics taking part in the
 trial consented for their clinic staff to participate and
 all individuals interviewed in the population surveys or
 process evaluation gave written informed consent to the
 interview.
 
<section> Role of funding source
 The funder had no involvement in the study.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> The baseline population survey collected information on
 3978 people, with a response rate of 84.2% (3978/4722)
 (figure 2). After excluding 44 questionnaires that were
 completed by a fieldworker who was later found to be
 unreliable, 145 respondents who reported that they did
 not use any public clinic and a further 376 respondents
 who used a clinic that was not one of the trial clinics,
 3413 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The
 end of intervention survey had a response rate of 80.3%
 (3184/3965) (figure 2). After excluding those who
 reported that they did not use public clinics (97) and
 those who did not use one of the trial clinics (548), 2539
 questionnaires were included in the analysis.
 There were no important differences in sociode-
 mographic or health variables between the control
 and intervention groups (table 1). Just under half of
 the respondents were found to have hypertension. In
 6%–10% the hypertension was controlled on treatment,
 9%–13% were on treatment but the hypertension was
 not controlled, and between 20% and 30% of the respon-
 dents had hypertension but were not on treatment. As is
 common in the black South African population, obesity
 was more prevalent in women than men. There are fewer
 men aged over 80 years in the second survey because we
 excluded individuals who had just participated in another
 research study. This resulted in a very small sampling
 frame for this small group of men, and so we selected for
 interview all the available men.
 When we planned the study, we were concerned that
 many individuals might move between intervention and
 control clinics and so we asked respondents which was
 their usual clinic and which was the last clinic they used.
 We found that less than 3.5% of individuals had switched
 between intervention and control clinics (see online
 supplementary table 1).
 
<section> Primary and secondary outcomes
 There was no evidence of an effect of the intervention
 in the primary outcome or in the first four secondary
 outcomes that were derived from the population surveys
 (table 2). None of the sensitivity analyses altered this
 conclusion. There was no evidence of a reduction in those
 with moderate or greater CVD risk (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83
 to 1.54). The 95% CI excluded the OR of 0.59 given by the
 clinically important difference in our sample size calcula-
 tion, providing very strong evidence that the intervention
 as delivered could not have achieved the desired change.
 By the end of the intervention, three quarters of patients
 with hypertension were attending the intervention clinics
 on the day of their appointment, compared with 56% in
 control clinics (figure 3), suggesting improved adher-
 ence.
 All clinics experienced an increase in the number of
 visits by patients with a chronic condition (figure 4) (anal-
 ysis of variance coefficient 53.3; P<0.01). The number
 of visits in control clinics was similar for those with and
 without hypertension. However, in the intervention
 clinics the number of visits by chronic patients (with and
 without hypertension) was greater than in the control
 clinics (figure 4). In particular, there were a significantly
 greater number of hypertension visits than other chronic
 condition visits in the intervention clinics (analysis of
 variance for patient with hypertension coefficient 1295;
 P<0.01, chronic conditions coefficient 463; P<0.01).
 
<section> Process evaluation
 The almost doubling of the number of patients with a
 chronic disease attending the clinics over the 18 months
 of the study, with no matching increase in equipment
 or space, resulted in both control and intervention
 clinics facing numerous challenges. These included BP
 machines that often failed to function, worn out cuffs,
 intermittent shortages of drugs and insufficient space
 for the increasing numbers of patients. The cuffs that we

 Despite these challenges, there were signs of improve-
 ment in the provision of care. The LHWs were encour-
 aged to support the nurses in identifying undiagnosed
 hypertension among patients attending for other
 reasons. In the intervention clinics, 760 patients without
 a diagnosis of hypertension were identified with high BP
 and half of them (40%, 301 individuals) subsequently
 received a diagnosis of hypertension during the
 months. Data from patient exit interviews suggest that
 waiting times may have been reduced in the intervention
 clinics (table 4).
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> We aimed to improve the management of hypertension
 by providing extra support from LHWs to the nurses who

 are responsible for the management of chronic condi-
 tions in primary care clinics. We found no evidence of an
 improvement in the management of hypertension as a
 result of our intervention. However, we did find improve-
 ments in the functioning of the intervention clinics in
 a number of important ways, including patients keeping
 their appointments, and more patients with hypertension
 returning to the clinics.
 This was a pragmatic trial, designed to test an interven-
 tion that was both affordable and sustainable in a sub-Sa-
 haran Africa context. Using the precis-2 tool, we (JG, MT)
 assessed that the trial had a score of 41 out of 45, where
 is the most pragmatic. 28 We aimed to only provide those
 parts of an intervention which, if effective, could conceiv-
 ably be funded by the South African Health budget. We
 provided some training for the nurses, and the implemen-
 tation manager tried to assist in getting the BP machines

 repaired using the normal systems. However, we did not
 supply extra BP machines. We did supply replacement cuffs
 for existing machines, but supplied these to both interven-
 tion and control clinics. Moreover, in keeping with the
 pragmatic nature of the trial, and to encourage clinic staff
 to feel ownership of the intervention, the ways in which the
 LHWs would support chronic disease care were decided
 separately in each clinic by the clinic staff.
 The trial was based on a strong research platform
 provided by the HDSS which allowed us to carry out strati-
 fied random sample surveys and also to collect information
 on clinic activity. The population surveys, which measured
 the BP control of respondents who usually used the study
 clinics, were designed to identify a change in the numbers
 accessing treatment for hypertension as well as a change
 in BP control. However, this measure included those who
 might not have attending the clinic as regularly as they
 should have been, reducing our chances of identifying the
 effect of improved care on BP control among those who
 attended a clinic regularly. (Alternative study designs were
 not possible: existing clinic records were not sufficiently
 reliable; intervening to strengthen the current filing system
 would have reduced the pragmatic nature of the trial; and
 setting up a study measuring station for each clinic was
 not affordable.) Moreover, as there were only eight clinics
 in the HDSS we were limited in the number of possible
 clusters.
 Through the implementation manager we were able
 to ensure fidelity to the planned intervention as well as
 sufficient flexibility to the local context. We were also
 careful to separate implementation and evaluation activi-
 ties. It is possible that the activity of the trial contributed
 to improved performance in the control clinics. We had
 a data entry clerk in all the control clinics who collected
 information about clinic users and, inevitably, contrib-
 uted to the management of the clinic files, and therefore
 relieved nurses of some routine tasks. However, we do not
 think this possible contamination was sufficient to reduce
 a difference between control and intervention outcomes.
 The lack of effect in BP control may be due to the poor
 condition of the BP machines and cuffs, and that both the
 intervention and the control clinics were overwhelmed by a
 rapid increase in numbers of chronic patients. This increase
 was due both to the continuing roll-out of antiretrovirals 
<section> for HIV and a hospital policy of referring outpatients back
 into primary care. In the intervention clinics, there was a
 further increase in patients with hypertension attending
 the clinic, most probably due to the intervention itself.
 An earlier study of the ICDM initiative in the same clinics
 demonstrated that management of HIV was more effec-
 tive than management of BP: less than 50% of the patients
 attending the clinic had controlled BP, nearly 90% of patients
 with HIV had a controlled CD4 count. 9 28 29 South Afri-
 ca’s HIV programme is vertically organised, with generous
 funding and a separate management structure, requiring
 more detailed reporting from primary care clinics. It may
 be that this also continued to distort the work in the clinics,
 despite attempts to integrate the provision of care; with no
 requirement to report patient outcomes for hypertension
 there is insufficient emphasis on improving clinical care.
 Systematic reviews of randomised trials have concluded
 that community health workers are effective in improving
 health and treatment outcomes, 31 the included studies
 predominately focus on a single condition or health
 outcome (breast feeding, immunisation, TB cure rates),
 rather than the provision of integrated care. Moreover, the
 health outcomes measured are often those achieved by the
 community health worker alone, rather than outcomes
 requiring the contribution of other healthcare workers, as
 in this study. We found only one systematic review of studies
 looking at the effect of task shifting, which focused only
 on shifting prescribing from doctors to nurses. 32 As far as
 we are aware, the Nkateko study was the first randomised
 controlled trial to assess the supportive role of LHWs in the
 management of hypertension in the context of clinic-based
 integrated chronic care.
 
<section> Conclusion
 Our intervention did not improve BP control, despite its
 success in increasing the number of patients with hyper-
 tension attending the clinic, as well as the number that
 attended on their appointed day. We believe that the study
 was compromised by the large and increasing demands
 on primary care, the dominance of the vertically funded
 HIV programme and the poor standards of equipment
 in clinics. However, as this study shows, adding additional
 human resources (even if readily available and rela-
 tively inexpensive) is unlikely to have an effect on health
 outcomes, without the necessary equipment to accurately
 measure BP, and sufficient clinical staff to treat the growing
 numbers of chronic patients. To be successful, task shifting
 interventions need to take account of all aspects of the
 patient encounter, and if possible other system-wide contex-
 tual changes (such as rapidly increasing patients). Our
 results, taken together with the existing evidence, suggest
 that LHWs can play an important role in supporting the
 management of hypertension.
