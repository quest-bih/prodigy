<section> ABSTRACT
 
<section> Introduction Uganda’s district-­level administrative units
 buttress the public healthcare system. In many districts,
 however, local capacity is incommensurate with that required
 to plan and implement quality health interventions. This study
 investigates how a district management strategy informed by
 local data and community dialogue influences health services.
 
<section> Methods A 3-­year randomised controlled trial (RCT) comprised
 of 16 Ugandan districts tested a management approach,
 Community and District-­management Empowerment for Scale-­
 up (CODES). Eight districts were randomly selected for each
 of the intervention and comparison areas. The approach relies
 on a customised set of data-­driven diagnostic tools to identify
 and resolve health system bottlenecks. Using a difference-­in-­
 differences approach, the authors performed an intention-­to-­
 treat analysis of protective, preventive and curative practices
 for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea among children aged
 and younger.
 
<section> Results Intervention districts reported significant net increases
 in the treatment of malaria (+23%), pneumonia (+19%)
 and diarrhoea (+13%) and improved stool disposal (+10%).
 Coverage rates for immunisation and vitamin A consumption
 saw similar improvements. By engaging communities and
 district managers in a common quest to solve local bottlenecks,
 CODES fostered demand for health services. However, limited
 fiscal space-­constrained district managers’ ability to implement
 solutions identified through CODES.
 
<section> Conclusion Data-­driven district management interventions
 can positively impact child health outcomes, with clinically
 significant improvements in the treatment of malaria,
 pneumonia and diarrhoea as well as stool disposal. The
 findings recommend the model’s suitability for health systems
 strengthening in Uganda and other decentralised contexts.

<section> Summary box
 
<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► Four factors constrain performance to improve child
 health: a lack of supportive policies; an inability to
 prioritise high-­ impact, evidence-­ based interven-
 tions; weak or broken supply chains for curative
 and preventative commodities and the absence of
 community-­based health promotion and care.
 
<section> ► Limited managerial capacity hinders the planning
 and management of decentralised health services,
 and communities lack the means to demand or
 demonstrate accountability for even the most basic
 health services.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► We provide evidence on how the data-­ driven
 decision-­making at different levels of implemen-
 tation improved access to the required preventive
 and curative services for children in a decentralised
 resource-­limited setting.
 
<section> What do the new findings imply?
 
<section> ► The findings show that it is possible to create a sys-
 tem for district health managers to use data, act on
 these data and provide quantitative proof of impact
 on health outcomes. However, to be effective, it is
 important to bridge the limited fiscal space that the
 district managers have to enable them to implement
 the identified solutions.
 
<section> persistently high rates of child mortality,
 four factors constrain performance: a lack
 of supportive policies; an inability to priori-
 tise high-­ impact, evidence-­ based interven-
 tions; inadequate skilled professional; weak
 or broken supply chains for curative and
 preventative commodities and the absence
 of community-­ based health promotion and
 care. 3–5 Compounding the complex mix of 
<section> challenges is the recent trend towards decentralisation.
 Central governments are devolving select managerial
 functions to district-­level administrators who are often
 unprepared and ill-­equipped to assume responsibility for
 critical health services. 6–10 As limited managerial capacity
 hinders the planning and management of decentralised
 health services, dissatisfaction intensifies among health
 system users and workers. 11–13 Circumstances deteriorate
 further still when communities lack the means to demand
 or demonstrate accountability for even the most basic
 health services. 10 In Uganda, a multiyear initiative called
 Community and District-­ management Empowerment
 for Scale-­up (CODES) aimed to enhance the govern-
 ment’s ability to combat diarrhoea, pneumonia and
 malaria—three of the country’s leading causes of child
 mortality. Building on the analytic framework pioneered
 by Tanahashi, CODES contributed to the identification
 of the source and potential remedy for major health
 system bottlenecks. 14 Like Tanahashi’s diagnostic model,
 CODES emphasised ‘effective coverage’, meaning the
 quantity of quality interventions needed to achieve the
 desired health impact. 15 The CODES model identified
 four determinants of effective service coverage: the
 enabling environment, supply, demand and the quality of
 services. Intended to accommodate diverse health system
 delivery platforms, CODES strived to help managers
 target resources towards context-­appropriate solutions.
 Applying bottleneck analysis at district level to key
 child health interventions, 16 17 together with commu-
 nity dialogue 18 for social accountability, we designed an
 randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the hypothesis
 that intervention districts would improve the coverage
 and quality of key protective, preventive and curative
 indicators for pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria
 compared with comparison districts.
 
<section> METHODS
 The CODES intervention package
 CODES was designed to diagnose and resolve health
 system bottlenecks, primarily the challenges related to
 the district’s management of local health services. The
 implementation of the intervention was carried out
 within the district health structure by selected partners
 (online supplemental table 1) under the management
 of UNICEF and Ministry of Health. The implementation
 followed a predesigned and static theory of change or
 logic framework (online supplemental material 1). The
 management intervention involved three mutually rein-
 
<section> forcing pillars:
 pillar 1 consisted of collating, analysing and applying
 programme and survey data. In each intervention district,
 the authors conducted three separate annual rounds of
 lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) 20 to identify under-
 performing indicators and underserved populations.
 Intervention districts used the data to prioritise bottle-
 necks and identify solutions. The solutions were costed
 and incorporated in annual district work plans. Districts
 submitted their completed work plans to relevant bodies
 for approval, as per normal practice. 21 To facilitate the
 implementation of locally identified solutions, UNICEF
 supplemented district budgets with a ‘bottleneck fund’
 of US$10 000 per district per year.
 Pillar 2 involved regularly reviewing and, where neces-
 sary, supporting the implementation of district work
 plans. District Health Management Teams were encour-
 aged to monitor implementation regularly, initiating
 quality improvement efforts within each planning cycle.
 District scorecards and a mentorship programme facili-
 tated interdistrict learning.
 Pillar 3 aimed to stimulate demand for services through
 community engagement. In each catchment area, 70–100
 community members joined local leaders to discuss
 LQAS survey findings, which were summarised in citizen
 report cards (see online supplemental figure 1). The
 participatory forums provided community members and
 healthcare workers with a unique opportunity to build
 consensus on priority problems and solutions. At the end
 of the community dialogue, participants prioritised their
 proposed actions in ‘community contracts’. Community
 volunteers then monitored and reported on implemen-
 tation using ‘U-­Report’, an SMS-­based platforms’ local
 radio stations lent additional momentum to the collective
 effort, promoting public demand for health services and
 advocating for the speedy implementation of community
 contracts.
 A series of sensitisation meetings introduced CODES
 to participating districts. Three implementing partners
 facilitated the meetings: Child Fund International (CFI)
 and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM),
 both focused on the supply side of the intervention and
 the Advocates Coalition for Development (ACODE),
 which concentrated on the demand side.
 Throughout the RCT, district data analysis, district
 management and community contacts remained
 unchanged in comparison districts. The results of the
 LQAS surveys in comparison districts were delivered in
 reports that had a tabular format.
 
<section> The bottleneck analysis
 Adapted from Tanahashi, 14 16 the analytic model for
 health system bottlenecks was applied to assesses six
 factors when appraising the effective coverage of select
 health services: (1) availability of essential commodities,
 (2) availability of human resources, (3) accessibility of
 distribution points, (4) initial utilisation of the interven-
 tion, (5) continued usage and (6) the quality of the inter-
 vention. 19 The bottleneck analysis is normally presented
 as a graph that cascades across categories such as supply,
 demand and quality. Each determinant is influenced by
 its predecessor in a manner that indicates a potential
 ‘bottleneck’ to be addressed. For the purposes of the
 CODES RCT, the authors selected tracer interventions
 from across the spectrum of ‘protect’, ‘prevent’ and
 ‘treat’. 16 22 While the Excel-­based bottleneck tool used for
 CODES did not explicitly capture indicators for policies, 
<section> social norms, budgets and related coverage determinants,
 these were considered when analysing the root causes of
 each bottleneck.
 
<section> Study design and district randomisation
 After an initial assessment of Uganda’s 111 districts, the
 RCT targeted 16 high-­mortality districts, and eight were
 randomly selected for each intervention and compar-
 ison. A sampling frame of 25 districts was selected
 purposively by UNICEF based on the absolute number
 of deaths expected for districts, which was obtained by
 applying regional DHS Infant and child mortality data to
 the projected district population of children under five.
 Details of the trial protocol and early implementation are
 published elsewhere. 4 9 10
 Prior to randomisation, the authors matched districts
 based on an index of 20 CHERG-­based child survival
 indicators. 23 The composite index was weighted based
 on each indicator’s: level of coverage in the district;
 impact on child mortality 23 and the proportion of total
 mortality attributed to a specific cause. 23 Thus, for each
 district, the index was calculated by summing all 20 child
 survival indicators and assigning a weight based on the
 three components. Since the districts in the sampling
 frame were quite heterogeneous, there was a need to
 stratify them in order to ensure that randomisation into
 intervention and control arms would occur within strata
 that were relatively well ‘balanced’ for fair comparison
 on some key factors associated with heterogeneity—that
 is, each randomly selected intervention district would
 have a corresponding randomly selected control district
 selected from the same strata—(ie, matched within the
 strata). Some factors that were in consideration for strati-
 fying the sampling frame (online supplemental figure 2):
 1. Whether this was parent (old) or child (new) district—
 given that new districts may not have been adequately
 constituted with human resources and infrastructure.
 Therefore, controlling for this as best as possible was
 critical given the intervention’s nature and outcomes
 of interest.
 2. Stratification on the current coverage of key child
 survival indicators pertaining: to do this, a composite
 Index was formed using available key child survival in-
 dicators of pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria for each of
 the 25 districts. The Indicator Composite Index was
 created as follows: inputting current level of coverage
 indicators for 21 Prevention Protect Treat child sur-
 vival indicators for Pneumonia, Diarrhoea, Malaria;
 impact on mortality of each of the indicators; the pro-
 portion of total mortality attributed to a cause For
 each district, a composite index was calculated by sum-
 ming over all the available key child survival indicators
 the product of these three components. A threshold
 for this index was used to divide into the sampling
 frame further in those districts below or above the me-
 dian threshold.
 Within the strata (online supplemental figure 2), we
 randomised districts to intervention: control in 1:1 ratio of
 intervention going for a homogenous match with respect
 to the factor indicated. After applying the eligibility
 criteria, the authors randomly selected eight pairs from
 the remaining districts. A coin toss determined which
 of the two districts from each pair would be targeted by
 the CODES intervention (figure 1). Makerere University
 remained independent of the study and conducted the
 randomisation. Descriptive district data are presented in
 online supplemental table
 The study districts were not aware of their allocation
 status to intervention or comparison group.
 
<section> Sample size calculations
 Sample size computations were based on the baseline
 for each coverage and quality indicator (see list of key
 primary outcome indicators) obtained from wave
 districts (CODES pilot districts) (online supplemental
 figure 3) and Uganda Demographic Health Surveys
 2011 estimates. We assumed 80% power of observing
 difference; differences of 25%–30% (regarded to be of
 public health significance) between intervention and
 control and a 5% significance level. We accounted for
 a design effect (intracluster correlation (ICC) of cluster
 randomised design—worst-­ case ICC=0.20). Details on
 sample size calculation can be found in the implementa-
 tion protocol.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> As indicated in the implementation logic framework
 (online supplemental material 1), the primary outcome
 measures were protective, preventive and curative indica-
 tors for the effective coverage of pneumonia, diarrhoea
 and malaria interventions, as described below and in the
 protocol paper.
 
<section> Protective coverage: exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months
 and adherence to the recommended schedule of vitamin
 
<section> A supplementation.
 
<section> Preventive indicators: full immunisation (based on stan-
 dard age-­ specific vaccination) within the first year of
 life; the standard diphtheria-­pertussis-­tetanus (DPT)
 indicator; use of long-­ lasting insecticide-­ treated nets;
 improved water and sanitation and handwashing with
 soap.
 
<section> Curative indicators: appropriate case management for
 malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea symptoms.
 We also evaluated secondary outcomes, including the
 2-­week prevalence of pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria
 symptoms among the target under-5-­ year age-­ group.
 Additional effort was made to document immediate
 management outcomes such as annual reports that
 prioritised bottlenecks for pneumonia, diarrhoea and
 malaria. The study was not designed to measure changes
 in mortality.
 
<section> Data collection and analysis
 The data analysis in this manuscript is based on the
 primary data at baseline between December 2013 and
 January 2014 and end line data collected between June 
<section> Figure 1 Trial profile. LQAS, lot quality assurance sampling; SA,
 and July 2016. The data collection relied on LQAS
 household surveys in both intervention and compar-
 ison districts at the baseline, midterm (2 years later and
 in intervention districts only) and end line, approxi-
 mately 33 months after the baseline. The participating
 16 districts were divided into five supervision areas.
 
<section> sepervision areas.
 
<section> Information from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics 24 facil-
 itated the random selection of 19 villages from each of
 the five supervision areas, based on the number of house-
 holds with probability proportionate to size. Assisted
 by UNICEF, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and imple-
 menting partners, the districts were trained on lot quality 
<section> assurance sampling (LSQA) data collection methodology
 and were responsible for data collection.
 A total of 760 individuals from each target group were
 sampled in both the intervention and control arms,
 per district in each of the five areas. The household
 LQAS surveys contained seven target population groups:
 mothers of children <6 months; mothers of children 6–11
 months; mothers of children 12–23 months; mothers of
 children <5 years; mothers of children <5 years with diar-
 rhoea in the last 2 weeks; mothers of children <5 years
 with acute respiratory tract infections in the last 2 weeks
 and mothers of children <5 years with fever in the last
 2 weeks. In each village, a random reference household
 was selected. The next nearest door to this household
 determined the first and subsequent household from
 which one interviewee was selected, with a maximum of
 one respondent per household.
 Adherence to the planned CODES interventions was
 assessed against reports from the implementing part-
 ners (CFI/LSTM and ACODE). Changes in manage-
 ment behaviour were measured through data obtained
 from participant observation, in-­depth interviews and an
 analysis of relevant district documents, including district
 health plans and implementation reports. 9 10 To evaluate
 community participation and demand-­side behaviour, we
 collated data from SMS surveys, LQAS surveys and focus
 group discussions.
 Primary analysis relied on an intent-­to-­treat approach.
 The authors conducted a difference-­of-­differences anal-
 ysis of indicators between the baseline and end line for
 the intervention and control districts, adjusting for the
 cluster randomised design 26 27 and using techniques
 that included a cluster-­specific and population-­averaged
 approach to longitudinal data analyses, 28 29 generalised
 estimating equations and random-­effects logistic regres-
 sion with analysis of covariance 30 as well as cluster-­
 adjusted χ 2 tests. 31 ORs and CIs were calculated and are
 reported here.
 
<section> Costing the CODES project
 Based on the eight wave one districts, we conducted a
 costing study to estimate the cost of scaling up the CODES
 project to all districts in Uganda. Three scenarios were
 considered for costing of the scale-­up of CODES activities
 to 115 districts (excluding Kampala). A full description of
 what these scenarios entail will be published elsewhere.
 In scenario 1, scale-­up of the CODES package includes
 all activities of the CODES package as was implemented
 during the wave 1 pilot phase, excluding costs for oper-
 ational costs but including minimal costs for technical
 assistance. In scenario 2, scale-­ up of CODES package
 includes ‘selected activities’ which are considered crit-
 ical to strengthening district health systems through
 improved management and supervision. On the demand
 side, we included: community dialogues, national advo-
 cacy campaigns and other materials for dialogues (citizen
 report cards, poster illustrations and hot-­line cards). On
 the supply side, we included: Health Facility Quality of
 Care Assessments, Bottleneck, Casual and Management
 Analysis workshop, work plan development and routine
 supervision. We considered the smallest ‘incremental
 package’ for scenario 3, which includes only activities
 that are unique to CODES and are not being routinely
 undertaken already. On the demand side, we consid-
 ered community dialogues and provision of materials to
 support community dialogues. On the supply side, we
 only considered: bottleneck analysis, Causal Analysis and
 Management Analysis workshops.
 
<section> Study ethics and registration
 The Uganda National Council for Science and Tech-
 nology granted ethical clearance for the study (Ref:
 SS2548). All participating districts were implementing
 the Uganda Child Survival Strategy, in accordance with
 the Health Sector Development Plan. 32 After explaining
 the study’s objectives and procedures, the authors
 obtained the informed consent of each participating
 individual. Confidentiality was maintained throughout
 the study. A Study Steering Committee chaired by the
 Ministry of Health convened the study team quarterly to
 facilitate policy linkages.
 
<section> Role of the funding source
 Both the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the
 UNICEF Fund for USA were involved in periodic progress
 reviews. Neither funding source influenced the design of
 the RCT nor any aspect of the data collection, analysis or
 interpretation of the study’s findings. The corresponding
 author had full access to all the data in the study and
 responsible for submitting the study’s findings for publi-
 cation.
 
<section> Patient and public involvement statement
 We involved the district health team, patients, community
 groups and national and international stakeholders in
 the design of the project. Throughout implementation,
 the patients were consulted through the U-­ reporting
 platform for their feedback on service delivery. The
 district health team was responsible for collecting data
 and disseminating results that informed their planning
 and implementation. We also had a national advisory
 committee whose role was to regularly guide the imple-
 mentation, diffusion and sustainability of the implemen-
 tation strategies.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Figure 1 shows the trial profile of the intervention. Socio-
 demographic characteristics of the samples are detailed
 in online supplemental table
 
<section> The intervention dose delivered
 Online supplemental table 2 shows the intervention
 dose delivered in the trial. All interventions were deliv-
 ered as planned in terms of numbers. However, the table
 also shows that most activities were on the supply side,
 especially at the district level and in health facilities, with 
<section> relatively few on the demand side through community
 
<section> end
 
<section> dialogues.
 
<section> and
 
<section> Management outcomes
 All intervention districts developed work plans that prior- baseline
 itised bottlenecks in managing pneumonia, diarrhoea
 and malaria. Each intervention district received US$10
 000 to supplement existing budgets. Even with the supple- the
 mental funding, many participating districts lacked the at
 funds to implement prioritised interventions. 33 Variations areas
 in management behaviours during implementation were
 observed across interventions and sites. We observed that districts
 some districts were more receptive than others, especially
 for the newly formed districts compared with those that
 had been in existence for some years (new vs old). It also comparison
 emerged that districts whose management teams were
 fully constituted performed better at adoption compared
 with those with partial composition or ones with managers
 not in substantive positions (acting vs substantive). It also and
 emerged that districts with longer exposure (wave 0 and intervention
 wave 1) performed better than those exposed to the
 intervention only during wave 1 (wave 1 vs wave 0+wave
 1). We also observed differences in the choice of inter-
 ventions for funding using the slush fund to supplement
 
<section> in
 
<section> existing budgets. 
<section> indicators
 
<section> Effect on protective coverage indicators
 Table 1 shows the effect of CODES on the indicators
 for protective interventions. Positive, statistically signifi- protective
 cant effects were registered for the recommended use of
 vitamin A 9+9·4%) among children 6–11 months. The
 effects on vitamin A use in the older child and on exclu-
 
<section> quality

<section> Effects on preventive coverage indicators for
 Immunisation and use of Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) ORs

 however, coverage levels remained below national and
 WHO targets. Effective bed net usage remained largely
 unchanged following the intervention. However, the

 safe sources appears to have increased by a net of 7·4%
 (CI −1·6 to 16·5) in favour of intervention districts. Net

 13·2% (CI 5·6 to 20·7) positive intervention effect with
 higher utilisation of zinc and oral rehydration solutions
 (ORS) in intervention areas. The effects of the interven-
 tion on the 2-­week prevalence of symptoms of malaria
 (fever), pneumonia (cough) and diarrhoea were insig-
 nificant at 95% CI.

 Figure 2 summarises the overall results of the CODES
 study. With the exception of the curative management
 of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea whose odds were
 higher in the intervention areas, other results reveal
 insignificant differences between the intervention and

<section> Cost of scaling up the CODES project
 The total cost of all CODES activities implemented in the
 eight districts in 2014 was US$1 929 014, and it was US$
 1 280 385 in 2015 and US$ 1 221 159 in 2016. Findings
 of the analysis show that technical assistance accounted
 for the largest proportion of the total costs, that is, 60%
 in 2014, 62% in 2015 and 43% in 2016. Operational costs
 took up the second largest share of total costs, accounting
 for 20%, 17% and 27% of total costs in 2014, 2015 and
 2016, respectively, while demand-­side interventions took
 up 5%, 10% and 15% and supply-­side interventions took
 up 15%, 11% and 15% of total costs, in 2014, 2015 and
 2016, respectively. Scenario 1 (the full package) gener-
 ates the highest total annual scale-­up cost of US$5
 389. Scenario 2 has a total annual scale-­up cost of US$2
 066 110. Scenario 3 has a total annual scale-­up cost of

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> Health managers in all intervention districts applied
 CODES tools to generate local data, diagnose health
 system bottlenecks and prioritise solutions. 9 10 Relative
 to comparison districts, intervention districts showed
 both clinically and statistically significant improvements
 in the management of malaria, pneumonia and diar-
 rhoea symptoms among children of 0–5 years, while
 there were generally smaller, nonsignificant improve-
 ments in protective and preventive coverage indicators.
 District health managers reported that CODES provided
 a context-­specific methodology for prioritising interven-
 tions. However, constraints in the policy and fiscal space
 open to district health managers impeded the imple-
 mentation of the locally identified solutions. 9 10 Similar
 results were found in Nigeria where despite prioritisation
 of identified bottlenecks at subnational level, effective
 implementation called for central government oversight
 especially those bottlenecks that could not be addressed
 at lower level. 34 Comparing across districts leadership
 and managerial capacity proved crucial for the adoption
 and successful implementation of childhood interven-
 tions.
 The study findings have several implications. First,
 while it is important to reinforce districts’ technical
 capacity for evidence-­based management, decentralisa-
 tion requires that interventions place equal emphasis
 on both local managers and local policymakers. Second,
 evidence is not enough—district managers need the
 requisite fiscal and decision-­making space to design and
 implement bespoke district work plans. 33 This finding
 compares well with results from Ghana and |Tanzania,
 which revealed that financial barriers were one of the
 major bottlenecks impeding success in combination with
 quality coverage. 35 36 Furthermore, fiscal space alone may 
<section> prove insufficient, unless district decision-­makers value
 the political benefits of evidence-­informed planning.
 The implementation of CODES demonstrates that
 a data-­ driven deliberate effort to strengthen district
 managers’ ability to identify, prioritise and resolve health
 system bottlenecks contributes to health outcomes. The
 study also underscores the need to identify which level
 of government is best positioned to activate particular
 types of solutions. For instance, the solution to a district’s
 overall lack of bednets, vaccines and drugs likely lies at
 the national level. A misalignment in the administra-
 tive levels between problems and solutions limits the
 potential impact of localised community action. In such
 instances, mechanisms must be found to transmit locally
 identified solutions across the various layers of health
 system management to the level empowered to solve the
 problem.
 In the CODES study, all intervention districts prior-
 itised improvements in the coverage of treatment for
 malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea in their workplans.
 These areas also saw the highest intervention effects.
 However, the coverage improvements in intervention
 districts stand out in sharp contrast to the deteriorating
 or stagnant levels of coverage reported in comparison
 areas, resulting from flat or declining levels of public
 health financing over the study period 40 and worsening
 management capacity. Indeed, we are aware that over
 the study period, planning and supervision support to
 districts by the ministry of health was limited and irreg-
 ular, which must have particularly affected comparison
 districts. Therefore, it is clear that scaling the gains
 achieved through CODES would likely require an
 increase in Uganda’s overall health expenditure, in addi-
 tion to continued efforts to address public system short-
 falls in management, human resources and medicines.
 On the demand side, we did not manage to catalyse
 a large number of community dialogues (17 per inter-
 vention district), keeping levels of population coverage
 and the ‘intervention dose’ low (see online supplemental
 table 4). 10 Similar to the results from Kenya, interventions
 like this tended to focus on improving the supply side of
 health services and less of investment in promoting the
 demand side. 42 As a result, our intervention had a limited
 impact on the prevention or population-­level indicators.
 However, participating community members expressed
 appreciation for the emphasis on social accountability.
 We note the potential impact of such interventions with
 the eventual development of scalable models. 43 For the
 purposes of the CODES trial, initial experiences with SMS
 reporting provided an affordable means of data collec-
 tion. However, to optimise impact, online reporting plat-
 forms such as U-­Report 44 45 need to operate in conjunction
 with scalable accountability mechanisms. Community
 dialogue meetings may prove cost-­ prohibitive, if they
 require external facilitation. 10 This area requires addi-
 tional innovation and research, including an assessment
 of Uganda’s ‘Barazas’ as a community forum for public
 debate on service delivery.
 
<section> Context, cost and policy
 Several contextual factors influenced the implemen-
 tation and effect of CODES. Health sector funding,
 particularly district-­level budgets, remains a challenge.
 During the study period, health sector allocations fell
 from 8·7% of the national budget in 2013/2014 to 5·7%
 in 2015, 46 despite the pre-­ existing national target of
 15% by 2020. At the time, Uganda prioritised funding
 for infrastructure, energy and security over the ‘unpro-
 ductive’ health sector. This trend, combined with the
 relatively high proportion of health expenditure allo-
 cated towards national hospitals (59·5% in 2015/2016)
 limited the fiscal and decision space available to district-­
 level managers to implement primary health care (PHC)
 activities. Consequently, even as intervention districts
 acquired new managerial strategies, solutions remained
 unfunded and unimplemented due to a lack of discre-
 tionary resources. This severely limited the potential to
 solve health system problems locally, a key assumption
 underlying the CODES approach. This is in contrast
 to the situation in neighbouring Tanzania, where local
 district management teams have a discretionary fiscal
 space of 1 US$/capita.
 To offset Uganda’s limited fiscal space, UNICEF
 created a ‘bottleneck fund’ of US$10 000 per district to
 support the implementation of unfunded interventions,
 primarily on the supply side. In many cases, although
 relatively small, this was the only fungible resource, or
 ‘fiscal space’, available for bottleneck solutions. However,
 in some districts, the mere existence of a prioritised
 ‘bottleneck action plan’ enabled districts to leverage
 additional resources from other development partners in
 the country, which further emphasises the importance of
 the CODES approach.
 A cost-­ effectiveness analysis for CODES will be
 published elsewhere. CODES was designed with the
 aim to be scaled up. We found that the costs of scale-­up
 were low. scaling up the full package of CODES to all the
 districts of Uganda was only US$5 893 389. Findings of
 the analysis showed that technical assistance accounted
 for the largest proportion of the total costs (43% to 60%
 per year), followed by operational costs (17% to 27%
 per year), with the demand-­side interventions taking up
 the least. These costs are low and can be absorbed by
 the MoH budget if it is increased slightly or increased by
 partners. The CODES project contributed to improved
 performance of district health systems in the eight wave
 1 intervention districts, and if appropriately scaled up, it
 could improve the general performance of the national
 health system.
 Thus, it is clear from the above that if districts are to
 implement evidence-­ informed implementation, they
 need commensurate fiscal and decision space. This, in
 turn, requires additional resources at the district level,
 with an increase in the proportion of domestic budgets
 allocated to the health sector. Furthermore, given
 that as much as half of the total health expenditure is
 derived from out-­of-­pocket expenditures in low-­income 
<section> countries, achieving quality coverage may require a dual
 focus on private and public healthcare providers. 41
 
<section> Methodological considerations
 This study employed customised LQAS surveys as the
 main data source for the bottleneck analysis. There are
 many advantages to the LQAS. 49 However, during imple-
 mentation of this study, we found that the use of LQAS
 can be cost prohibitive in Ugandan districts. In two times
 a day to scale the CODES intervention across Uganda,
 the government, therefore, now uses administrative data
 from district health information system-2 (DHIS2), which
 includes an automated function for graphing bottlenecks
 (the score card). 21 This innovation requires further anal-
 ysis to understand its utility and affordability and the
 implications of shifting from population to facility-­based
 data.
 The methodology for the CODES study presented
 certain limitations. The study relies on self-­ reported
 outcome data, as all household surveys. Furthermore,
 financial constraints prohibited a midterm coverage
 survey in comparison districts. The clustered design
 resulted in a larger than projected ICC of coefficients,
 leading to wide design-­adjusted CIs and a possible failure
 to reach statistical significance for some indicators that
 otherwise showed positive effects from the CODES
 intervention.
 While the findings are highly contextually depen-
 dent on local health systems, we suggest that the inter-
 ventions may have similar effects in other decentralised
 health systems, with potential for larger effects where
 more resources and decision space are available to local
 managers.
 
<section> CONCLUSION
 The CODES trial is the first of its kind to test whether
 district-­ level management interventions impact child
 health outcomes at the population level. Implementation
 of the CODES interventions led to modest increases in
 the effective coverage of curative care for malaria, pneu-
 monia and diarrhoea symptoms in population-­ based
 surveys. The results indicate that the CODES approach
 should be considered in efforts to scale-­up child health
 interventions across Uganda and in similar settings, and
 as a model for district health systems strengthening. Find-
 ings from the CODES study also point to the need for
 balance between demand and supply-­side interventions,
 ensuring sufficient fiscal space and authority to local
 managers to act on findings, and the utility of implemen-
 tation research to improve health system management.
