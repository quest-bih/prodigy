 deaths and stillbirths and 46% of the maternal deaths occur
 or on the day of birth [4]. These statistics highlight the impor-
 care and its significance to maternal and newborn survival. 
<section> The Preterm Birth Initiative – East Africa (PTBi EA) set out to decrease the burden of mortality among PTB
 through improving quality of facility-based intrapartum care. Per our study logic model of change [5], an intra-
 partum-immediate newborn quality improvement package focused on preterm identification and management
 would result in improved survival. While the PTBi EA intervention package emphasized key topics related to
 PTB, it also sought to improve overall quality of care during the intrapartum and immediate postnatal period
 in the facility, which research has shown to be key to saving newborn lives [6]. Specifically, the intervention
 package was developed based on available evidence that up to two-thirds of neonatal deaths could be avert-
 ed by improved uptake of evidence-based practices described by the Every Newborn Action Plan [4]. Previ-
 ous research recommended the use of priority packages in an integrated approach for effective improvement
 in neonatal outcomes [4,6]. Each of the PTBi package components was chosen because it met stakeholder re-
 quirements of: (a) having the potential to improve quality of care for preterm infants as well as for the moth-
 er-baby dyad more generally, and (b) demonstrable effectiveness as standalone interventions based on prior
 evidence. Our intervention package reinforced evidence-based practices, many of which should be observed
 for all births including those of intrapartum monitoring and neonatal resuscitation [7].
 The PTBi EA trial’s primary analysis showed the package to be effective in reducing intrapartum stillbirth and
 neonatal death (primary outcome), as well as predischarge newborn mortality (secondary outcome) among
 preterm infants [8]. Because stakeholders involved in the design and implementation of the intervention pack-
 age prioritized elements believed to improve care for all births, we hypothesized that it would also impact sur-
 vival among all births. Therefore, the objective of this secondary analysis was to examine the impact of the PTBi
 quality improvement intervention package on stillbirth and predischarge newborn mortality, as a composite
 outcome, among all births in participating facilities starting in October 2016 up to June 2018 in Uganda and
 up to March 2019 in Kenya. As the facilities in the two countries were heterogenous by several accounts, we
 also examined if the intervention effect was differential by country. We additionally investigated the impact
 of the intervention on predischarge maternal mortality. Our manuscript follows the recommendations of the
 CONSORT Statement [9] that is relevant for cluster randomized trials.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Study design and setting
 
<section> As described elsewhere, PTBi EA conducted an unblinded, pair-matched cluster-randomized controlled trial
 (cRCT) in select health facilities in Migori County, Kenya and Busoga Region, Uganda [5]. Interventions were
 delivered at the facility level. Twenty-three rural and peri-urban facilities were assessed for inclusion in the cRCT
 (Figure S1 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document) with the following criteria: (a) 24-hour labor and de-
 livery services, (b) at least 200 births per year, and (c) a comparable facility in the same country to pair-match.
 Three facilities - one county referral hospital in Kenya, one district referral and one regional referral hospital in
 Uganda - were excluded from the cRCT because of lack of comparable facilities to pair-match. However, these
 referral facilities received the intervention package in order to benefit from any quality improvement activi-
 ties, achieve and maintain similar quality of care standards, and to prevent lower-level facilities from referring
 to a center with inferior quality of care.
 
<section> In Kenya, the cRCT included 14 public and two non-profit missionary facilities. Among these, two performed
 caesarean sections and none had functional newborn care units or onsite pediatricians. One control site added
 caesarean section capacity while the study was ongoing. Together, the 16 facilities had approximately 11
 deliveries per year, during the study period. On average, one to two midwives covered each shift.
 In Uganda, the cRCT included four district-level facilities, two public and two non-profit missionary hospi-
 tals. All four facilities did caesarean sections, and each had a newborn care unit without capacity for contin-
 uous positive airway pressure or an onsite pediatrician. Together, the four facilities had approximately 9000
 deliveries per year, during the study period. The facilities in Uganda were higher volume than those in Kenya,
 with two to three midwives per shift.
 
<section> Matching and randomization
 
<section> Counts of indicators between June 2015 and May 2016 from maternity registers were used to match and gener-
 ate 10 facility pairs. A non-bipartite matching algorithm was used to match by country, monthly deliveries, de-
 liveries to staff ratio, stillbirth rate, low-birthweight rate, and predischarge newborn death rate [5,8]. Field teams
 reviewed the preliminary matched pairs, and five of the ten pairs were re-matched on the basis of local knowl-
 edge of functional level and facility type. After final matching, a study statistician randomly assigned one from
 each pair to the intervention group. Nature of the intervention rendered allocation concealment impossible. Quality improvement intervention for management of preterm births
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> The intervention package for the trial was designed using an integrated approach to optimize care for the moth-
 er-baby dyad, to impact provider behavior at critical moments during triage, labor, birth, and the early neonatal
 period. The four components of the interventions package are described in detail elsewhere [7]. Additional-
 ly, a summary is provided in Figure S2. in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document. The intervention package
 included: (a) PRONTO simulation and team training; (b) quality improvement collaboratives; (c) modified
 Safe Childbirth Checklist (mSCC); and (d) data strengthening [5,7]. The package aimed to strengthen provid-
 er skills, teamwork and emphasized use of evidence-based practices for PTB, including but not limited to the
 appropriate administration of antenatal corticosteroids, immediate skin to skin contact, breastfeeding, new-
 born resuscitation, and feeding preterm neonates. PRONTO training focused on provider skill development in
 emergency obstetric and neonatal care, including preeclampsia, hemorrhage and a focus on PTB, while quality
 improvement collaboratives allowed intervention facilities to discuss quality improvement projects and their
 effects on target indicators. The mSCC served to provide reminders of key evidence-based practices, with an
 emphasis on PTB and triage processes prior to admission. The data strengthening component focused on ma-
 ternity register completion and data quality particularly for accurate gestational age and outcome indicators.
 Data strengthening and introduction of the mSCC were implemented in both intervention and control facil-
 ities beginning in May 2016 and continuing throughout the study. In October 2016, PRONTO training and
 quality improvement collaboratives began in the 10 intervention facilities and continued throughout the study
 period. Before the trial began, sites were assessed and if basic equipment and/or supplies, such as functional
 digital scales and neonatal bag and masks, were found unavailable, PTBi EA provided these items to standard-
 ize resource availability across sites. These expenses did not exceed US$50 000 in either country.
 
<section> Data collection
 
<section> Anonymized individual-level data for all births were extracted each month from facility-based maternity reg-
 isters by PTBi study staff and entered into an encrypted Open Data Kit platform. Each mother and infant were
 assigned unique but linked identifiers. Data collected include, maternal (age, multiplicity, referral status) and
 newborn (birth weight, gestational age at birth, APGAR scores, infant sex) characteristics, mode of delivery
 and maternal and newborn status at birth and discharge.
 
<section> While preterm neonates (defined as fresh stillbirths and livebirths weighing 1000-2499 g irrespective of ges-
 tational age, or 2500-2999 g with a recorded gestational age of less than 37 weeks) were invited to participate
 for follow-up at 28 days after birth for the cRCT primary analysis, there was no provision for follow-up after
 discharge for the remaining births in the cohort. For our primary cRCT analysis, any stillborn and liveborn
 neonates weighing less than 1000 g, irrespective of gestational age, were excluded because they were consid-
 ered previable in both countries. However, all births registered in the maternity ward, regardless of their birth
 weight or gestational age, were included in this secondary analysis.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> Birth outcome was determined by triangulating delivery status, APGAR scores and baby discharge status. Still-
 births included intrapartum stillbirth (recorded as “fresh stillbirth” and defined as intrauterine death of a fetus
 during labor or delivery), antepartum stillbirth (recorded as “macerated stillbirth” and defined as intrauterine
 death of a fetus before the onset of labor showing degenerative changes), and those recorded only as “stillbirth”
 in the maternity register. Sometimes the delivery status and/or the baby discharge status recorded only stillbirth,
 ie, a sub type was not defined, and the APGAR scores were zero. Those cases were designated as “undefined
 stillbirth.” To reconcile the heterogeneity, we included intrapartum, antepartum and undefined stillbirths into
 one overall group as “stillbirth.” Predischarge newborn mortality was defined as death of a liveborn baby be-
 fore facility discharge, which we combined with stillbirth and investigated as a composite outcome in this sec-
 ondary analysis. Pregnancy-related maternal death was defined as deaths from any cause related to or aggra-
 vated by pregnancy or its management during pregnancy and childbirth, as recorded in the maternity register.
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> Sample size for the primary outcome of the PTBi cRCT is presented elsewhere [5,8]. For this secondary analy-
 sis with 29 442 births (Table 1 and 
<section> Figure 1) and estimated intracluster correlation of 0.02, the power is 56%
 at the 5% significance level to detect a 1.8% difference between the two arms (5.4% vs 3.6%, 
<section> Table 2), for
 the composite outcome. For Uganda, with 14 509 births, this study had 78% power to detect a 2.8% (7.5%
 vs 4.7%, 
<section> Table 2) difference between the study arms.

 Quality improvement intervention for management of preterm births

<section> For this secondary analysis, all births (n = 29 442) were included (Figure 1) and their characteristics were
 
<section> all births
 
<section> compared across arms to examine arm balance. We also examined the trend of the composite outcome stillbirth
 and predischarge newborn mortality, by arms, over the study period. We followed similar analytical methods
 to measure the intervention effect, as reported previously for the primary analysis [8]. With individual births
 as unit, we performed intention-to-treat analysis using multilevel logistic regression adjusting for pairing be-
 cause of the pair-matched design. We used a random intercept for each facility, accounting for clustering of
 deliveries within facilities and quantified appropriate standard errors. We quantified the overall effect of the
 PTBi intervention and the differential effect by country, as the facilities in the two countries were relatively
 heterogenous. The statistical significance of the differential effect (interaction) by country was examined us-
 ing a product term in the model, following which we fit stratified models. The main results report the effect
 of intervention on the composite outcome as well as the other outcomes by comparing all births between the
 intervention and the control facilities, during the study period.
 
<section> We have previously reported an effect of the PTBi intervention on the primary outcome that included only
 preterm and low birth weight neonates followed up to 28 days (n = 2938) [8]. In order to under-

<section> the PTBi primary cohort, preterm macerated stillbirths that were ineligible for the PTBi primary cohort, moth-

 cluded (n = 29 442) with the excluded sample (n = 19 046), as shown in 
<section> Figure 1. To understand if

 gregated for both countries – 0.77 (95% CI = 0.56-1.05); Kenya – 0.99 (95% CI = 0.77-1.29); Uganda – 0.59
 (95% CI = 0.45-0.79); P = 0.006). Furthermore, compared to the results among all births, the interven-

 tion effect for predischarge newborn mortality became significant, aggregated for both countries (0.83, 95%
 CI = 0.70-0.97) and for Uganda (0.77, 95% CI = 0.75-0.79). The effect on predischarge maternal mortality,
 which was based on few events, flipped direction and remained statistically non-significant.
 We observed a difference in distribution of stillbirths by study arms between all births and the excluded births
 (Table S2 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document). However, in sensitivity analysis_3, when all births were
 combined with excluded births (n : 29 442 + n : 19 046 = 48 488,

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> The PTBi intervention package did not show a measurable impact on newborn survival among all births in
 the 20 hospitals across Kenya and Uganda combined. However, results suggest improved newborn survival
 only in the Ugandan hospitals demonstrating that this package of facility-based interventions focused on PTB,
 has the potential to improve survival of all births in the facility. The environment of continuous training and
 quality improvement likely increases skills among providers, but also serves to refresh overall evidence-based
 care for all births and affects general quality of intrapartum care in the facilities. For predischarge newborn
 mortality alone or for predischarge maternal mortality, the intervention did not show significant effects overall
 or by country, though the confidence interval for the former is more in support of an effect, rather than null
 effect [10]. In the case of predischarge maternal mortality, no significant effect is likely due to too few events.
 Robustness of the results to various sensitivity analyses reaffirms that these are likely true effects and not po-
 tentially driven by alternative explanations.
 
<section> The lack of significant results in Kenya suggests that the context of the two countries may be key as an im-
 portant implementation research finding. Kenya had 16 facilities ranging from health centers to sub-county
 hospitals, reflecting more variation in the types of cases attended, availability of medical doctors, infrastruc-
 ture and equipment across facilities. For example, only 3 of the 16 Kenyan facilities, while all 4 Ugandan fa-
 cilities, had caesarean sctions capacity and newborn units. Furthermore, when counts of births and outcomes
 were compared within matched pairs, the results were more heterogeneous in Kenya than in Uganda. Ken-
 ya also experienced a protracted health worker strike which may have caused degradation in provider skills
 (including possible degradation in the effect of the intervention) and accelerated staff turnover. On the other
 hand, all 4 Ugandan hospitals were at the district level and staffed by on-site pediatricians and obstetricians.
 Stronger results for Uganda could also be due to a number of factors including greater improvement in care,
 given worse rates to begin with, better fit between the intervention package and the levels of care provided
 in these facilities, and/or factors affecting fidelity of implementation. For example, with larger delivery vol-
 umes in Uganda facilities than Kenya facilities, this may have provided more frequent opportunity for pro-
 viders to implement skills learned through the PTBi intervention package. These observations illustrate the
 importance of recognizing and considering contextual factors that may influence both intervention imple-
 mentation and outcomes.
 
<section> One possible implication of these results is that packages such as the PTBi may be optimally effective at a cer-
 tain level of the health care system. Facilities in Kenya were much smaller and may not have been optimally
 organized to most benefit from the intervention, or high staff turnover may have had a disproportionate impact.
 The same intensity of intervention may have impacted more in lowering the rates in Uganda (because the rates
 were much higher to begin with) than in Kenya by better catering to the health system needs in that country
 [11]. Thus, a range of factors may have contributed towards marked improvement in Uganda but not in Kenya.
 As this analysis investigates a secondary outcome, and in light of no overall effect, the results should be viewed
 critically. This group previously reported significant effect of the intervention on the survival of preterm in-
 fants in the intervention facilities compared to the control facilities [8]. This article is a logical extension of the
 analysis to all (preterm and term) births. The remarkably similar magnitude of the intervention effect among
 all births in Uganda (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.44-0.98, n ~ 14 500) reported here with that reported previously
 among PTB births in Kenya and Uganda (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.54-0.81, n ~ 3000) is unlikely to be by chance.
 We have demonstrated that the intervention effect among all births is not driven by the effect on PTB (sensitivity
 analysis_1). Rather, the results hold when the PTBi primary cohort and all other PTB were excluded, demon- 
<section> strating that the effect was more likely to be on term births as well as PTB. Furthermore, in term births (sen-
 sitivity analysis_2), the intervention effect was significant for predischarge newborn mortality, overall as well
 as in Uganda, unlike in all births. The significance achieved despite a smaller sample in sensitivity analysis_2
 was possible because the effect was larger in magnitude in term births than in all births. This finding signifies
 that the intervention increased chances of survival among the term births as it did among the PTB (reported
 earlier [8]). This interpretation is further supported by results obtained after adjusting for APGAR score when
 the intervention effect becomes non-significant (Table S4 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document). We hy-
 pothesize that the intervention effect can be explained by APGAR at 5 minutes since it is in the causal pathway
 between intervention and increased survival (as a mediator). The intervention likely improved providers’ abil-
 ity to assess newborn status at birth as well as the confidence to manage a neonate not spontaneously breath-
 ing at birth. In fact, the intervention included reinforcement of key actions providers should take in the first
 5 minutes of life for a newborn not spontaneously breathing at birth (eg, immediate neonatal resuscitation).
 We explored potential alternative explanations for the intervention effect. The series of exclusions (Figure 1)
 leading to the final study sample could have induced selection bias. More stillbirths were excluded in the inter-
 vention arm than in the control arm (Table S2 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document). However, this was
 not the case for predischarge newborn mortality. Large differences between the included and excluded births
 were not observed for any other characteristics (Table S2 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document). We con-
 ducted sensitivity analysis to examine if the main results were due to differential selection of study samples in
 the two arms. Results presented in Table S3 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document demonstrate that se-
 lection bias, if any, is unlikely to explain the intervention effect. Given the nature of the intervention and as-
 sessments of outcomes, which are expected to be uniform within a facility, measurement bias is also unlikely.
 Our findings are similar to others taking a package approach including quality improvement and provider
 training. Ashish et al. reported a stepped wedge trial in Nepal that included both quality improvement in-
 terventions and provider training focused on neonatal resuscitation in public hospitals with at least 1000
 births per year [12]. Of note, our facilities in Uganda all had more that 1000 births per year, whereas Kenyan
 facilities ranged from 310-1599 deliveries per year [8]. Similar to our results, the Nepal study found a pos-
 itive impact on stillbirth and newborn mortality, though there was some variability across facilities [12]. In
 addition, a systematic review of quality improvement as a single intervention was reported to have variable
 effects, while quality improvement combined with provider training shows positive impact on health out-
 comes [13]. Unique components of the PTBi intervention like simulation and team training implemented in
 Mexico demonstrated that it can reduce neonatal mortality [14]. In other studies, from Guatemala and India,
 PRONTO’s simulation and team training increased use of evidence-based practices in normal and compli-
 cated deliveries when these activities were integrated along with didactic teaching and demonstrations [15-
 18]. Similar packaged interventions are currently being implemented in several sub-Saharan countries to ex-
 amine if individual components can synergistically act with each other to bring about a larger reduction in
 perinatal mortality [19,20].
 
<section> The study has several strengths as well as limitations. Amongst the key strengths are the randomized design
 and the availability of data on all births that allowed investigation beyond PTB. The consistency and the logical
 coherence of these results with the earlier results on PTB lends credibility. This trial is an important addition to
 the literature in its demonstration that a package approach can be advantageous, though it may not be equal-
 ly effective in all contexts, pointing to the need for further implementation research in this area. An important
 limitation was power, despite which the Uganda-specific results were strong enough to reach statistical signif-
 icance. The intervention was a package of four components (quality improvement collaboratives, PRONTO
 simulation and team training, mSCC and data strengthening), two of which (mSCC and data strengthening)
 were implemented in the control facilities. Thus, the comparison group in this trial were not pure controls,
 which could potentially underestimate the effect. There was a health worker strike in Kenya during the trial,
 which likely affected provider turnover, provider motivation, and retention of any pre-strike learning. Data
 for the study were obtained from facility registers, which may have quality issues, especially during excessive
 delivery loads. However, data strengthening component of the intervention likely mitigated some of its effect,
 as described elsewhere [8]. There may have been some misclassification between stillbirth and predischarge
 newborn mortality among infants who died very shortly after birth. Such misclassification will not affect the
 results for the combined outcome but may have affected the stillbirths or predischarge mortality specific re-
 sults. Finally, despite best efforts, perfect matching of facilities within pairs may not have been achieved, espe-
 cially regarding immoveable infrastructure and community characteristics to which these facilities cater. Such
 differences could have left residual imbalance between arms. Quality improvement intervention for management of preterm births
 
<section> CONCLUSIONS
 
<section> The PTBi intervention appears to have improved survival not only among PTB, as reported earlier, but also
 among all births in Uganda. We did not observe the same effect in Kenya, which is intriguing and hints to-
 wards factors that were contextually different in the two countries. Efforts to sustain the achieved improve-
 ment should be the next logical step of focus. From the research perspective, it will be important to delineate
 the differences in package implementation, settings and care that might have led to these results.
