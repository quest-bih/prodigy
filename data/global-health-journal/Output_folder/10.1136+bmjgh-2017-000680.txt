 Received 12 December 2017 neonates, identification and treatment of sick neonates
 Revised 14 June 2018 and young infants using oral and injectable antibiotics
 Accepted 13 July 2018 and community mobilisation. The package was similar in
 both intervention arms—SR and AWW; difference being
 healthcare provider. The control arm received routine health
 services from the existing health system. Primary outcomes
 were neonatal and young infant mortality rates at ‘endline’
 period (2008–2009) assessed by an independent team from
 January to April 2010 in the study clusters.
 
<section> Findings A total of 6623, 6852 and 5898 births occurred in
 the SR, AWW and control arms, respectively, during the endline
 period; the proportion of facility births were 69.0%, 64.4%
 and 70.6% in the three arms. Baseline mortality rates were
 comparable in three arms. During the endline period, the risk of
 neonatal mortality was 25% lower in the SR arm (adjusted OR
 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99); the risks of early neonatal mortality,
 young infant mortality and infant mortality were also lower by
 32%, 27%, and 33%, respectively. The risks of neonatal, early
 neonatal, young infant, infant mortality in the AWW arm were
 not different from that of the control arm.

<section> Key questions
 
<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► Pooled analysis of trials from South Asia found a sig-
 nificant reduction in neonatal mortality rate (NMR)
 following home-­ based newborn care (pooled RR
 0.75; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92) suggesting greater ben-
 eficial effect with a higher baseline NMR (>50 per
 1000 live births) based on the results of subgroup
 and meta-­regression analyses.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► We found a similar magnitude of reduction in NMR
 when home-­based newborn care is delivered by
 dedicated worker even in settings with low NMR
 (low ‘endline’ NMR—of 33.5 per 1000 live births—
 in the control arm) and high facility birth.
 
<section> What do the new findings imply?
 
<section> ► Home-­based newborn care is effective in reducing
 neonatal mortality including deaths within first week
 of life and infant mortality particularly when deliv-
 ered by dedicated worker even in setting with high
 facility births.
 
<section> India. 1 With a neonatal mortality rate (NMR)
 of 26 per 1000 live births and infant mortality
 rate of 39 per 1000 live births, 2 deaths in the
 neonatal period alone contribute to two-­
 thirds of infant deaths in India. Even among
 postneonatal infant deaths (1–12 months),
 a major proportion of deaths occur in the
 second month of life. Any further reduction
 in infant mortality is therefore intricately
 linked to a major reduction of neonatal and
 young infant (0–59 days) deaths.
 Various attempts have been made to imple-
 ment innovative approaches for newborn care
 at community/home level. The Cochrane
 review on community-­ based interventions
 found a significant reduction—by about
 25%—in neonatal mortality with community 
<section> mobilisation and antenatal and postnatal home visits
 by health workers. 3 The Lancet Every Newborn Study
 Group estimated that immediate scaling up of various
 community-­ based and primary care interventions can
 avert almost a third of all neonatal deaths by 2017 and
 one-­fifth by 2025.
 One of the key components of community-­based inter-
 ventions for neonatal health is the home-­based newborn
 care (HBNC), that is, care provided at homes by health
 workers in the antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal
 periods. An earlier study by the Society for Education,
 Action and Research in Community Health (SEARCH)
 in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra, India, demon-
 strated that HBNC by trained female village health
 workers significantly reduced the NMR by up to 62% in
 settings with high baseline NMRs. 5 The effectiveness of
 this approach in diverse rural settings with varying NMRs
 needs to be assessed given the profound implications of
 this intervention. If effective, such an approach must be
 incorporated into the existing health systems.
 In this background, we conducted a community-­based
 cluster randomised effectiveness trial at multiple sites
 across India to evaluate the effect of home-­based care
 for neonates and young infants delivered by community-­
 based workers on neonatal and young infant mortality
 rates (YIMR). The primary research question was whether
 a package of interventions for young infants (0–59 days of
 age) delivered through home visits by (1) existing village-­
 level community workers and (2) specially recruited
 village-­level workers tasked to perform newborn/young
 infant care would reduce their mortality rates.
 
<section> Methods
 Study area and existing health system
 This community-­ based cluster randomised trial was
 conducted in five districts in the north, east and western
 states of India: Barabanki (Uttar Pradesh), Cuttack
 (Odisha), Patna (Bihar), Rajsamand (Rajasthan) and
 Yavatmal (Maharashtra). The study was implemented by
 non-­governmental organisations at two districts (Action
 Research and Training for Health, Udaipur (Rajsamand)
 and National Institute of Applied Human Research and
 Development, Cuttack) and by government institutions
 at the other three districts (King George Medical College,
 Lucknow (Barabanki), Patna Medical College (Patna)
 and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences,
 Wardha (Yavatmal).
 The public healthcare infrastructure at these districts
 comprised a hierarchical system of district hospital(s),
 community health centres (CHC), primary health centres
 (PHC) and subcentres (SC). Typically, the health services
 are provided by medical officers, nurses and auxiliary
 nurse midwives (ANM) at facility level, and by ANM and
 anganwadi workers (AWWs) at the community level. An
 ANM usually caters to a population of 5000–7000 and
 provides antenatal check-­ups, counselling of pregnant
 women and childhood immunisation. The AWW serves
 approximately a population of 1000 and is responsible
 for supplementary nutrition to pregnant and lactating
 women and preschool children and non-­formal educa-
 tion to preschool children.
 
<section> Study design and ethical considerations
 The study was designed as a three-­arm cluster randomised
 controlled trial, with PHC being the unit of randomi-
 sation. The intervention package in the two interven-
 tion arms was delivered by either a specially recruited
 community-­based worker—Shishu Rakshak (SR)—or
 by the already existing AWW. The control arm received
 routine health services from the public and private
 health system.
 
<section> Selection of clusters
 The study sites were selected in consultation with the
 state and district health authorities, the essential criteria
 for selection being a high NMR (>40 per 1000 live births)
 and high incidence of home deliveries (>70%). A base-
 line survey was undertaken in nine conveniently selected
 PHCs in each district to estimate NMRs and home deliv-
 eries in the year preceding survey (2002–2003). From
 these nine, six PHCs (in each district) that fulfilled the
 criteria were selected to participate in the study. Usually,
 one PHC served a population of about 30 000. In case
 a PHC catered to more than 30 000 individuals, only a
 limited number of SC enough to cover 30 000 population
 were included.
 
<section> Randomisation, consent and ethics
 The PHCs were paired to arrive at matched three sets
 (two PHCs in each) with comparable NMRs in each
 study district. These were then randomly allocated to
 the two intervention arms and control arm with the help
 of computer generated random numbers (generated by
 an independent statistician). Thus, two PHCs in each
 district constituted 10 clusters in five districts in each arm.
 Informed verbal consent was obtained from the village
 leaders, mukhiyas (chiefs) and heads of the panchayats
 prior to beginning of the study. At each site, a safety
 monitoring committee monitored the safety of the inter-
 vention. A central Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
 monitored the overall study progress and results.
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> Preparatory phase
 The preparatory phase of the study began in January
 2003 with the baseline house-­to-­house survey by trained
 local field workers who collected information on preg-
 nancy history in women of reproductive age group and
 the number of neonatal deaths in the last year. This was
 followed by selection of the SR in those sites that were
 randomised to SR arm. Selection was done in 3-­day resi-
 dential camps, the eligibility criteria being (1) resident
 of the village, (2) education of at least 5th standard and
 uptil 10th standard (3) has been a mother herself and
 (4) willing to attend delivery at night and undergo resi-
 dential training. For the other intervention (AWW) arm,

 the AWWs already in place were deployed. These workers
 were employed by the state government (salary approx-
 imately US$50) and had varying level of training and
 experience.
 The workers from both the categories were trained in
 the same manner by using competency-­based training
 curriculum, modules and manual developed by SEARCH,
 Gadchiroli. Initially, the SEARCH team trained the
 master trainers-­cum-­field supervisors from all five study
 sites in three training workshops of 15–17 days each.
 The master trainers in turn conducted training of SRs
 and AWWs at respective study sites in seven workshops
 of 5 days duration each, interspersed by field practice
 of 1 month. The training involved classroom sessions
 followed by hands-­on in the field, and was accomplished
 in a step-­ladder fashion, that is, one set of skills at a time.
 The whole training package was covered in 17 modules.
 In addition to SRs and AWWs, the ANMs from the health
 system were also trained on supportive supervision
 for two days apart from their regular training. In both
 the intervention arms, 2-­ day training workshops were
 conducted for the traditional birth attendants (TBAs)
 (on safe delivery practices) and for medical officers of
 PHCs and private practitioners (orientation training).
 Training of master trainers began in October 2003 and
 was completed in August 2004, while training of SR/
 AWW/ANM began in November 2003 and got completed
 in December 2004 (save for AWW arm of one centre, which
 got completed by April 2005). The workers were assessed
 after each training session and a final evaluation was done
 at the end of training. A joint team of Indian Council of
 Medical Research (ICMR) and SEARCH conducted the
 end-­of-­training assessment. Because many workers did
 not acquire the skills necessary for giving intramuscular
 (IM) injections after a single training session, additional
 training sessions were conducted by using dummies and
 having hands-­on sessions in the health facilities. Regular
 reorientation training and on-­job training for the SR/
 AWWs were undertaken during monthly meetings.
 
<section> Intervention phase
 In the next phase, the trained workers (SRs or AWWs)
 performed house-­ to-­ house surveys every 2 months to
 identify eligible women. Pregnant women thus identified
 were registered at around fifth month of pregnancy and
 were provided the package of interventions. Briefly, the
 package consisted of the following interventions—health
 education, care at birth, care of normal/low birthweight
 neonates, identification and treatment of sick neonates
 and young infants, and community mobilisation (table 1;
 further details provided in online supplementary web
 table 1). The package essentially remained the same in
 both the intervention arms (save for the provision of IM
 injection for sepsis in the SR arm; Table 1)—only the
 healthcare provider was different.
 Health education messages during antenatal period
 and on the second day after delivery comprised of
 care and nutrition during pregnancy, birth prepared-
 ness (antenatal care (ANC), tetanus toxoid immunisa-
 tion, safe delivery), early initiation and exclusive breast
 feeding, prevention of infection, prevention and manage-
 ment of hypothermia and recognising danger signs
 during pregnancy and danger signs in the neonates and
 seeking immediate help from health worker. The village-­
 level worker—SR/AWW as per the intervention arm—
 attended delivery along with the TBA and provided care
 at birth (if the women chose to deliver at home). She
 did suctioning with an oral mucus sucker and if required,
 bag and mask ventilation for newborns with weak/absent
 cry or slow breathing at birth. She weighed them within
 6 hours of birth using Salter weighing scale (with sensi-
 tivity of 100 g) and counselled the mothers regarding
 thermal care and early initiation of breast feeding and
 duration of exclusive breast feeding. She also assessed 
<section> for high-­risk status to decide on the number of follow-­up
 visits at home. For health education, a flipchart and a
 1-­hour long digital versatile disc (DVD)—‘Nanhisi Jan’
 (tiny life)—produced by SEARCH were used in the
 intervention clusters. Information gathered from focus
 group discussions during preparatory phase was used as
 resource information for health education messages.
 Home visits were made on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28,
 35, 42, 49 and 56 for normal newborns, and on days 1,
 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 28, 35, 42, 48 and 56
 for high-­risk newborns (defined as birth weight <2000 g
 or preterm or breastfeeding problems on the first day of
 life). Gestation was determined using the last menstrual
 period method, confirmed with the help of local events
 calendar. During home visits, the workers assessed the
 newborns for any signs of illness, recorded temperature
 using a digital thermometer, provided treatment for
 minor illnesses and offered referral services for those with
 severe disease like suspected sepsis. Newborns with hypo-
 thermia (axillary temperature <35°C) were managed by
 keeping in a warm bag or by covering with blankets; those
 with hyperthermia (temperature >37.2°C) were managed
 with adequate breast feeding, oral paracetamol and
 optimal room temperature and ventilation. Sepsis was
 suspected in the presence two or more of the following
 conditions: weak or abnormal cry, poor suck or inability
 to suck, drowsy or unconsciousness, temperature >37.2°C
 or <35°C, multiple skin pustules or pus draining from
 umbilicus, persistent vomiting or abdominal distension
 and fast breathing (respiratory rate more than 60/min
 in a quiet infant). All infants with probable sepsis were
 referred to a health facility. If the family refused or was
 unable to go to a health facility but consented to home
 treatment, the worker managed the infant at home with
 oral cotrimoxazole and IM gentamicin. The project team
 at the sites ensured supplies of equipment and drugs
 for managing newborns at home in both the interven-
 tion arms. All the SRs and AWWs were provided a kit
 containing weighing scale, thermometer, bag and mask,
 syringes and medicines (box 1). They were also provided
 performance-­linked remuneration up to Rs.350 (US$6)
 per month.
 In the control arm, the ANM/AWWs provided antenatal
 and newborn care services through antenatal contacts
 and three postnatal home visits as per the ongoing
 Reproductive and Child Health programme. All study
 clusters—irrespective of the random group allocation—
 were open to concomitant improvements and changes
 in the healthcare and developmental activities driven by
 the respective state governments. For example, as a part
 of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), facility
 strengthening took place, accredited social and health
 activists (ASHA) got deployed and Janani Suraksha
 Yojana (JSY) got scaled up in all the three arms during
 implementation of the trial.
 Implementation of the intervention began in January
 2005 (figure 1). However, the full package of interven-
 tions including IM injections for probable sepsis could

<section> be implemented from only 2007 because of the delay in
 obtaining ethical clearance for this particular interven-
 tion and the longer time required to acquire the skills
 by the workers. In the AWW arm, injection component
 could not be imparted because permission was not
 granted for AWWs to administer IM injections. A district
 steering committee was constituted at each site that met
 every 6–12 months to address issues related to imple-
 mentation. The health authorities at the district level
 were involved in the study from the planning stage. The
 District Health Officer was designated as coinvestigator
 in this study and ANMs, LHVs were envisaged to provide
 supportive supervision to SRs/AWWs.
 
<section> Data collection
 During the intervention phase, the SRs and AWWs
 collected data and maintained records of past pregnancy,
 problems during current pregnancy and delivery details
 including duration of labour, place of delivery, personnel
 conducting delivery, type of delivery, birth outcomes for
 all pregnant women. They also recorded the need for
 resuscitation at birth, time of first visit to the baby, time of
 initiation of breastfeeding, birth weight and morbidities
 detected on follow-­up visits for all the babies. They were
 monitored by a supervisor (1 for every 20–30 workers)
 who crosschecked the information collected by them
 on randomly identified cases and validated all the births
 and deaths by visiting the households and/or verifying
 with other sources. The supervisor also provided on-­job
 training to the workers and refresher training during
 monthly meetings. He/she did not fill-­up any separate
 forms.

<iend>

 In addition, the coverage data for other key indicators
 such as home visits for health education during antenatal
 period, home deliveries attended by SRs and AWWs, first
 examination of infant within 24 hours of birth (only for
 home deliveries), postnatal home visits and sepsis cases
 managed were recorded from the self-­reported service
 delivery records of SR and AWW.
 
<section> Outcomes and their measurement
 Primary outcome measures were the endline neonatal
 and YIMR at the end of the intervention period (2008–
 2009). NMR and YIMR were defined as the number of
 deaths within 28 days and within 59 days of life, respec-
 tively per 1000 live births. The secondary outcomes
 were early-­NMR (deaths within 6 days of life/1000 live
 births), infant mortality rate (IMR; deaths from 0 to
 days/1000 live births), stillbirth rate (stillbirths per 1000
 births) and perinatal mortality rate (stillbirths plus early
 neonatal deaths per 1000 births).
 Evaluation of the intervention was done by means of an
 endline cross-­sectional survey conducted from January
 2010 to April 2010. The survey got delayed by about
 months due to practical reasons (the intervention phase
 was over by March 2009; last follow-­up home visit was
 done in May 2009). An independent team who had no
 role in implementation of the intervention conducted
 the survey using similar methods and tools as the baseline
 survey. The team was provided names of all the PHCs/
 villages and the data collection tools of the baseline
 survey. Extensive efforts were made to ensure complete
 enumeration of all households in the intervention and
 control arms.
 The survey team collected information on births,
 deaths and other key demographic indicators for all the
 births in the clusters as well as for those births in which the
 mothers delivered outside the cluster areas but returned
 within 2 months of the date of delivery. For convenience
 of enrolled mothers, information was collected for the
 period from Holi festival in March 2008 to Holi in March
 2009. Process outcome: In addition to the mortality
 indicators, coverage in the intervention arms was also
 assessed by recording the proportion of births attended

<section> by the SRs and AWWs for the period from 22 March 2008
 to 21 March 2009 in the two intervention arms.
 
<section> Quality control of data
 Data were double entered in CSpro database that had
 built-­in range and consistency checks. The surveillance
 supervisors–1 for every 5–6 field workers of the survey
 team–independently filled up the forms of 5% infants
 and then cross-­checked with the forms submitted by the
 field workers. They also checked all details of randomly
 selected 5% households by through spot checks and
 reinterviews. In addition, the members of central coor-
 dinating team also independently validated the details of
 births and deaths in a randomly selected sample during
 their field visits. The central team also observed a few
 interviews conducted by the field workers.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 Assuming a baseline NMR of 40/1000 live births, design
 effect of 1.5, 95% level of confidence (one sided), and
 80% power, we had to enrol 1500 live births in each arm
 to detect 50% reduction in NMR in the two intervention
 arms. The estimated sample size was more than enough
 to detect the same quantum of reduction in the other
 primary outcome (young infant mortality with baseline
 rate of 50/1000 live births) also. With the prevailing birth
 rate of 25/1000 population, it was expected that two
 PHCs with an average population of 30 000 each had to
 be included for enrolling 1500 live births in a year. There-
 fore, two PHCs were included in each of the three arms.
 This sample size calculation was for each state. However,
 the mid-­ term survey—planned a priori to inform the
 Project Advisory Committee (PAC) and DSMB—showed
 a secular trend with lower NMR and YIMR in all the
 arms including the control arm (see online supplemen-
 tary web table 2). In view of the low baseline NMR than
 expected, the PAC recommended to analyse the results
 from all five sites together to have a single effect size at
 the end of the study.
 Analysis was by intention to treat at cluster and partici-
 pant levels. We analysed the data from all the sites together
 with adjustment for clusters, as per the DSMB approved

 plan of analysis (see ‘online supplementary: Plan of anal-
 ysis’). Means and proportions of background characteris-
 tics were compared using analysis of variance and X 2 test.
 Mortality rates were adjusted for religion, caste, resident
 status (resident/visitor), and education at the individual
 level, and distance to district hospital (<25 km), access
 to PHC or CHC, presence of private clinics, provision
 of JSY and presence of ASHA at the cluster level. The
 adjusted ORs, along with 95% CIs, of mortality rates were
 estimated for each intervention arm—after adjusting for
 cluster design—by using ‘logistic’ model in Stata V.11.2
 (StataCorp). For cluster adjustment, we considered each
 village as a ‘cluster’ because the outcomes were more
 likely to be correlated within the village than the PHCs
 (which were only 10 in each arm).
 The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry of
 India (CTRI/2011/12/002181).

 from socially disadvantaged groups were similar in the three
 arms. Only one-­fourth of deliveries happened at a health
 facility, and less than one-­third were attended by a skilled
 birth attendant in all the arms. The NMR ranged from
 to 55 per 1000 live births while the YIMR varied from 60 to
 61 per 1000 live births in the three arms (table 2).
 
<section> Coverage of interventions
 Table 3 shows the coverage of study interventions in the
 two intervention arms. The source of this information was
 the service delivery record of SRs and AWWs (available for
 4788 and 3956 deliveries, respectively). When compared
 with AWW arm, more women received home visits during
 the antenatal period, a higher proportion of deliveries at
 home were attended by the worker, more newborns were
 examined within 24 hours after birth, and more infants
 were suspected to have sepsis in the SR arm. About one-­
 third (39.8%) of infants with probable sepsis in the SR arm
 received oral cotrimoxazole and IM gentamicin; another
 one-­fifth received oral cotrimoxazole alone. In the AWW
 arm, about half of the infants (53.2%) with probable sepsis
 received oral cotrimoxazole alone; no IM injections were
 administered in this arm. When compared with SR arm,
 the proportion of infants being referred to a health facility
 was higher in the AWW arm (table 3). No adverse events
 related to IM injection administration were documented in
 the SR arm. Out of the 259 SRs recruited, 82% (212) had
 acquired desired injection skills.
 
<section> Endline survey
 The endline survey (for 2008–2009 period) covered
 848, 66 888 and 61 042 households in SR, AWW and
 control arms, respectively (table 4). Maternal age and
 religion were similar in the three arms but there was
 significant difference in the caste distribution—about
 21% of women in the control arm belonged to general
 category (‘others’) in contrast to 14% of the women in
 SR and AWW arms. More villages in the control arm had

<section> Key indicators during endline period (2008–2009)
 Most women had at least one antenatal visit by ANM in
 all the three arms; the proportion of women who had
 three or more antenatal visits by ANMs was, however,
 low in the SR arm when compared with the other two
 arms (table 4). About two-­thirds of deliveries occurred in
 health facilities, though the proportion of facility births
 was lower in the AWW arm. More than 90% of women
 received tetanus immunisation in all the arms. A higher
 proportion of mothers who delivered in health facilities
 in the SR and AWW arms than those in the control arm
 received payment under JSY programme (table 4).
 
<section> Outcomes: mortality rates
 Table 5 provides the mortality rates in the three arms.
 There were 173, 202 and 194 neonatal deaths, respectively,
 in the SR, AWW and control arms during the final year of
 intervention. The risk of neonatal mortality was 25% lower
 in the SR arm than the control arm (adjusted OR 0.75,
 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99). There was also a significant reduc-
 tion in the risks of early neonatal mortality, young infant
 mortality and infant mortality—by 32%, 27% and 33%,
 respectively—in infants in the SR arm when compared
 with those in the control arm (table 5). The stillbirth rate
 was not different between the SR and control arms, but
 the perinatal mortality rate was significantly lower in the
 former (adjusted OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.93).
 The risks of neonatal mortality, early neonatal mortality,
 young infant mortality and infant mortality in infants
 born in the AWW arm were, however, not different from
 those born in the control arm; similarly, there was no
 difference in the stillbirth rate or perinatal mortality rate
 between the AWW and control arms (table 5).

<section> Discussion
 
<section> The present study showed a significant reduction in the
 neonatal, young infant and infant mortality rates in the
 SR arm—but not in the AWW arm—when compared
 with the control arm (table 5). The coverage of intended
 interventions like home visits for health education during
 AN period, deliveries at home attended by SR/AWW and
 postnatal visits within 24 hours of birth was significantly
 higher in the SR arm than the AWW arm (table 3). The
 study, therefore, confirms the effectiveness of HBNC
 package, if delivered by a dedicated village level worker
 and a reasonably high coverage is achieved.
 The findings of the present study are not entirely
 ‘new’; rather they reaffirm the results of the previous
 community-­ based cluster RCTs on HBNC from South
 Asia 6–9 and Africa. 10 An earlier systematic review that

 included five such trials from South Asia 6–9 11 found a
 significant reduction in NMR following HBNC (pooled
 RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92). 12 It had suggested a greater
 beneficial effect with a higher baseline NMR (>50 per
 1000 live births) based on the results of subgroup and
 meta-­regression analyses. 12 We found a similar magni-
 tude of reduction in NMR in the SR arm—adjusted OR
 0.75; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99. Our results are particularly
 noteworthy because of the low ‘endline’ NMR—33.5 per
 1000 live births—in the control arm. The updated meta-­
 analysis including the trial from Africa 10 and the present
 study revealed 22% reduction in NMR following home
 based care (seven studies; pooled effect size 0.78; 95% CI
 0.67 to 0.90; see ‘online supplementary web figure 1’).
 Of the two intervention arms, only one (SR) showed
 a significant reduction in the neonatal and YIMR while
 the other (AWW) did not. This apparent discrepancy
 in beneficial effects between the SR and AWW arms is
 unlikely due to underlying differences in baseline char-
 acteristics between the two arms (given the similar demo-
 graphic characteristics like NMR and place of birth;
 table 2). The key components of intervention were also
 the same, except for IM injections for probable sepsis
 (table 1). The major difference between the two arms,
 apparently, was the presence of a new, dedicated health
 worker—SR—in the SR arm. It seems that her presence
 ensured much higher coverage of key interventions like
 home visits during AN period and first postnatal home
 visit within 24 hours after birth in the SR arm than in the
 AWW arm (table 3). About 40% of infants with probable
 sepsis in the SR arm did receive IM gentamicin along
 with oral cotrimoxazole whereas no IM injections were
 administered in the AWW arm. But provision of IM injec-
 tions alone is unlikely to explain the difference in effect
 between the two arms given that only 40% of eligible
 infants received IM injections in the SR arm. Hence, the
 
<section> BMJ Global Health
 
<section> discrepancy observed in beneficial effects between the
 SR and AWW arms was most likely due to delivery of the
 interventions by a dedicated health worker and not by
 the ‘routine’ staff. Interestingly, the subgroup analysis
 in the updated meta-­analysis based on the presence of
 dedicated/specially recruited health worker showed 36%
 and 12% reduction in NMR, respectively, in the studies
 with and without dedicated health worker (see online
 supplementary web figures 1 and 2). The magnitude of
 benefit observed in the AWW arm—15% reduction—is
 consistent with the pooled effect size of the studies that
 employed only existing health staff. Indeed, the present
 study has possibly addressed a major policy dilemma
 faced by most governments in low-­income and middle-­
 income countries—whether to deliver the home-­based
 package of newborn interventions by a dedicated health
 worker or by the existing village level worker. Unlike the
 SR, the AWW had to take care of her routine tasks like
 child development and nutrition, in addition to deliv-
 ering the study interventions. The modest and non-­
 significant benefits observed in the AWW arm despite
 training, incentive, and supervision demonstrates that
 there are limits to expanding the multitasking role by a
 given class of providers beyond their primary mandate.
 The other interesting and programme-­relevant finding
 of the study relates to the effects of the intervention on
 early NMR and infant mortality rates. Infants in the SR
 arm had 32% lower mortality in the first week of life—the
 observed effect size for early NMR was more than that
 of NMR (32% vs 25%; table 5). The beneficial effects in
 early NMR were observed in facility births also (online
 supplementary web table 3), which underscores the need
 for postnatal home visits by the health workers in the first
 few days of life, irrespective of the place of birth. Infants
 in the SR arm had 27% lower mortality in 0–59 days
 (young infant mortality) and 33% reduction in 0–364 
<section> days (infant mortality; table 5). This could be due to
 the ‘lasting’ effect of the family and provider-­counsellor
 contact, in the crucial days including antenatal and post-
 natal period, on healthy behaviours like exclusive breast-
 feeding and care-­seeking. Newborns are likely to fall sick
 even if they are delivered at facility when they return
 home after discharge from the hospital. HBNC ensures
 continuam of care beginning from care during antenatal
 period, through labour and birth, followed by care at
 postnatal period. This is an additional convincing argu-
 ment in favour of scaling up HBNC for further reduction
 in neonatal including early NMR.
 
<section> Strengths and limitations
 The major strengths of the study are the cluster
 randomised study design, having two intervention arms
 to address the pertinent question on the need to have a
 dedicated health worker to deliver the package of inter-
 ventions, the package of interventions being similar to
 the original HBNC package in the Gadchiroli study,
 similar and independent measurement of outcomes in
 the intervention and control clusters, and large sample
 size.
 The study has important limitations too. First, the
 outcomes were measured by a survey and not by ongoing
 surveillance of births and deaths in the clusters. Also, the
 survey was conducted almost a year after the completion
 of intervention phase. The risk of recall bias and bias in
 categorising the deaths—neonatal ersus postneonatal
 mortality—cannot be ruled out. But given the nature of
 the outcome (death) and the overall pattern in reduction
 of different mortality rates in the SR clusters, the risk of
 these biases is likely to be low; also, the recall bias is likely
 to be similar in three arms. Second, the trial included
 only 10 clusters per arm. A smaller unit of randomisation,
 such as villages, would have improved the efficiency of
 cluster randomisation. Third, the coverage of interven-
 tions in both the SR and AWW arms was not optimal—a
 small but considerable proportion of infants did not
 receive the whole package of interventions in both the
 arms; less than half of the infants with probable sepsis
 received IM injections in the SR arm. If the coverage of
 interventions were almost universal, the observed benefi-
 cial effects could have been more striking.
 With the launch of NRHM, several efforts were made to
 improve maternal child survival that resulted in substan-
 tial increase in numbers of institutional delivery at the
 time of endline evaluation. The proportion of facility
 births in the present study was around 67%—more than
 double the rate at baseline. Therefore, we did post hoc
 subgroup analysis based on the place of birth, which
 revealed results similar to that of overall study cohort
 for facility births—the risks of neonatal, early neonatal,
 infant, young infant and perinatal mortality were found
 to be significantly lower in the SR arm but there was no
 difference in the mortality rates between the AWW and
 control arms. Among home births, no difference was
 found in the mortality rates between either the SR and
 control arms or the AWW and control arms (possibly
 because of the small numbers and subsequent low power;
 online supplementary web table 3).
 
<section> Implications for policy-makers
 The findings of the present study have three major impli-
 cations for the policy-­makers. First, the HBNC package,
 if delivered optimally, has the potential to reduce both
 neonatal (including early neonatal) and infant mortality
 rates. The effect on early neonatal mortality is particu-
 larly important because of the high proportion of deaths
 occurring in the first week of life and the general lack of
 interventions known to reduce the early NMR. Second,
 to achieve maximum benefits, presence of a dedicated
 health worker is a must. Third, the intervention is rele-
 vant even in settings with high rates of facility births.
 
<section> Conclusions
 This cluster randomised community-­ based trial
 conducted at five sites across India confirms that the
 HBNC package is feasible to deliver and is effective in
 reducing neonatal and YIMR, particularly when deliv-
 ered by a dedicated worker devoted to only maternal/
 neonatal care. The intervention package was effective
 even in settings with high rates of institutional births.
