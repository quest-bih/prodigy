<section> Abstract
 
<section> Youth living with HIV (YLHIV) report that negative interactions with health care workers
 (HCWs) affects willingness to return to care. This stepped wedge randomized trial evaluated
 effectiveness of a standardized patient actor (SP) HCW training intervention on adolescent
 engagement in care in Kenya. HCWs caring for YLHIV at 24 clinics received training on ado-
 lescent care, values clarification, communication, and motivational interviewing, with 7 SP
 encounters followed by facilitated feedback of videotaped interactions. Facilities were ran-
 domized to timing of the intervention. The primary outcome was defined as return within
 months after first visit (engagement) among YLHIV who were either newly enrolled or who
 returned to care after >3 months out of care. Visit data was abstracted from electronic medi-
 cal records. Generalized linear mixed models adjusted for time, being newly enrolled, and
 clustering by facility. YLHIV were surveyed regarding satisfaction with care. Overall,
 HCWs were trained, and medical records were abstracted for 4,595 YLHIV. Median YLHIV
 age was 21 (IQR 19–23); 82% were female, 77% were newly enrolled in care, and 75%
 returned within 3 months. Half (54%) of trained HCWs remained at their clinics 9 months
 post-training. YLHIV engagement improved over time (global Wald test, p = 0.10). In
 adjusted models, the intervention showed no significant effect on engagement [adjusted
 Prevalence Ratio (aPR) = 0.95, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.88–1.02]. Newly enrolled
 YLHIV had significantly higher engagement than those with prior lapses in care (aPR =
 1.18, 95%CI: 1.05–1.33). Continuous satisfaction with care scores were significantly higher
 by wave 3 compared to baseline (coefficient = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.19–0.58). Despite provider
 skill improvement, there was no effect of SP training on YLHIV engagement in care. This
 may be due to temporal improvements or turnover of trained HCWs. Strategies to retain SP-
 training benefits need to address HCW turnover. YLHIV with prior gaps in care may need

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Adolescents and young adults in Eastern and Southern Africa make up 70% of youth living
 with HIV (YLHIV) worldwide [1]. In 2020, antiretroviral coverage of YLHIV ages 10–19 in
 Kenya was 74% [1], falling short of 95-95-95 goals. YLHIV also have poor care outcomes com-
 pared to other age groups, with consistently higher rates of loss to follow up and lower rates
 viral suppression than adults or young children [2–4]. In Kenya, a 2012–2016 review of
 national data found elevated viral load among adolescents with HIV 10–19 years was double
 that of adults (37% vs 13%) [5]. Globally, adolescent HIV-related deaths have declined just
 37% since 2010, while child mortality has declined by 60% [6].
 Adolescence is a time of rapid physiological, developmental, and psychosocial changes,
 characterized by increasing autonomy and identity formation [7]. These unique changes may
 aggravate preexisting stressors associated with HIV infection, increase vulnerability to depres-
 sion and mental health concerns, and exacerbate poor adherence and retention in care [8–11].
 Recognition of the distinct needs of adolescents within HIV service delivery has prompted
 global initiatives to promote “adolescent friendly” health services (AFHS) [12,13]. The World
 Health Organization recommends that AFHS are not simply separate infrastructure and space,
 but also a change in health provider attitudes and training. Adolescent friendly care aims to
 ensure that health providers are “non-judgmental and considerate in their dealings with ado-
 lescents” and that they have the “competencies to deliver the right health services in the right
 way” [12]. The Kenyan Ministry of Health adopted these recommendations, revising 2005
 guidance in youth friendly health services in 2016 [14].
 While health providers report recognition of adolescent needs and awareness of adolescent
 friendly guidelines, many also still report lack of confidence in how to engage with and care
 for adolescents. A study of reproductive health providers in Kenya documented a disconnect
 between advertised “youth friendly services” and providers’ lack of competency and training
 to carry out adolescent friendly care, especially related to counselling and interpersonal com-
 munication [15]. They describe feeling conflicted between their own personal feelings, cultural
 and religious values and beliefs, and their wish to support young people’s rights to accessing
 services. In another study, health care workers tasked with providing adolescent HIV testing
 services reported feeling inadequately prepared to cope with the needs of this age group, lack
 of confidence in counseling skills, and fear of doing the wrong thing [16].
 Standardized patient (SP) training presents a unique opportunity to train health care per-
 sonnel to effectively deliver AFHS. SPs are trained actors that work with health providers in
 mock clinical encounters for the purposes of training and evaluation [17]. Used since the
 1960s in clinical and medical education and for licensing exams in the United States and
 Europe [18], SPs have been less widely used in resource-limited settings. SP training has been
 shown both to improve clinical performance including provider skills in empathy, patient-cen-
 tered communication skills, and counseling [19,20] as well as patient outcomes [21–23].
 This study aimed to develop and evaluate a clinical training intervention utilizing standard-
 ized patient actors to improve communication and interpersonal skills of health care workers
 in working with adolescents, resulting in increased engagement in HIV care. Our hypothesis,
 informed by Andersen’s Model of Healthcare Utilization [24,25], was that a SP training pro-
 gram would improve the health care environment and patient-centered HIV services through 
<section> provider factors of building trust and empathy, enhancing communication skills, and increas-
 ing provider clinical and counseling knowledge. This improvement in delivery of care could,
 in turn, address barriers cited by adolescents and improve linkage to, and retention in, vital
 
<section> HIV services.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Ethics statement
 
<section> This study was reviewed and approved by the University of Washington (51926) institutional
 review board and the University of Nairobi—Kenyatta National Hospital (P476/06/2016) ethi-
 cal review committee. Health worker participants provided written informed consent. Adoles-
 cent surveys were anonymous, thus we received approval to waive written consent and allow
 adolescents 14 and older who attended care independently to provide oral self-consent. Ado-
 lescents under the age of 14 provided oral assent and their caregiver provided oral consent.
 De-identified medical records were provided through an agreement with the Ministry of
 Health.
 
<section> Design
 
<section> A stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate a clini-
 cal training intervention using standardized patient actors to improve communication and
 interpersonal skills of health care workers caring for adolescents and young adults, as a means
 to increase YLHIV engagement in care [26]. Twenty-four health care facilities (clusters) were
 randomized to intervention sequence (Fig 1, S1 Checklist).
 The stepped wedge study design was selected because intervention-delivery occurred at the
 clinic, rather than individual level, to facilitate cluster recruitment, and for logistical consider-
 ations as the training was not feasible to implement simultaneously at a large number of clinics
 [27]. This design also can have greater power than a parallel design when there are substantial
 intra-cluster correlations (i.e. within facilities) or large numbers of clusters [28]. Randomiza-
 tion at a clinic level to when the intervention is introduced allowed for the traditional benefits
 of randomization, while allowing the minimal risk intervention to be provided to all sites.
 Training was conducted with health providers from participating facilities at 4 time points,
 months apart (Table 1). Outcomes were assessed among YLHIV in participating facilities over
 a period of 15 months following each training. The final 6 months of outcome assessment was
 truncated due to extensive changes in patient visit schedules due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
<section> Population and setting
 
<section> Eligible clinics had more than 40 adolescents, had a current electronic medical record (EMR)
 system, and no other special adolescent interventions. From 24 enrolled facilities, up to ten
 health providers from each facility were selected for the training. Eligible providers included
 clinical officers, doctors, nurses, and counselors who provide direct clinical services to adoles-
 cents. Providers were identified by the study coordinator in collaboration with the facility
 manager. Turnover of health providers at their study sites was monitored during the study
 period and newly hired providers enrolled if sites had not yet participated in the intervention.
 Retention in care and clinical outcomes were assessed via an audit of EMR charts from YLHIV
 10–24 years of age, and a subset of YLHIV from each facility were also enrolled to complete
 patient satisfaction and risk behavior surveys after each training wave.

 didactic sessions and SP encounters. Lectures included content in adolescent development
 and national guidelines for YLHIV care, communication skills, and motivational interviewing.
 Group exercises in communication and values clarification were also conducted. Participant
 providers then rotated through 7 different SP encounters, followed by individual feedback
 from SPs and a facilitated group debriefing in which the training group reviewed a video
 recording of one of each participants’ SP encounters. Lectures and facilitation were delivered
 by study team clinicians with expertise in adolescent HIV care.
 Instrument development and actor training followed the Association of Standardized
 Patient Educators (ASPE) Standards of Best Practice [31]. Cases were based on literature
 review, previous qualitative work [16,32], and an expert advisory panel. The seven cases
 included a practice scenario with no treatment challenges, advancing in difficulty and includ-
 ing issues of disclosure, adherence, sexually transmitted infections, gender-based violence,
 family planning, alcohol and drug use, depression, and sexual identity [32]. Actors were
 recruited and auditioned through a casting agency and trained in the SP methodology and the
 specific cases by an expert trainer and study staff.
 The intervention training schedule was planned to minimize disruption to clinic operations
 and accommodate provider availability from April 2017 through October 2019. During each
 wave it took 2–4 weeks to train in groups of 6 providers. Participants from different clinics in
 the Nairobi and Kiambu counties and those in Western Kenya sites trained together. Once
 clinic staff were trained, it was presumed that all YLHIV enrolled in care at their respective
 facilities were exposed to the intervention.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome for this study was youth retention in HIV care, specifically during early
 engagement (Table 2). Engagement was defined as returning for a first follow-up visit within
 months of enrollment. To ensure adequate sample, YLHIV who had previously been lost to
 follow-up (LTFU) were included with an engagement definition of return for a follow-up visit
 within 3 months after re-engagement in care. Previous LTFU was defined as no clinic record
 for at least 3 months and no record of death or transfer to another facility. Hypothesized pro-
 cess measures intended to clarify the causal pathway included provider competency ratings
 before and after the intervention and adolescent satisfaction with care. Satisfaction with care
 questions were derived from concepts listed in the Kalamazoo consensus [33] and adapted
 from a validated youth-provider interaction assessment [34]. Overall satisfaction was recorded
 on a Likert scale (very unsatisfied = 1, somewhat unsatisfied = 2, neutral = 3, somewhat 
<section> satisfied = 4, very satisfied = 5). Satisfaction surveys were completed at baseline and after
 waves 1–3 of training. Wave 4 was not completed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Finally, secondary measures of retention within longer time frames (180 days and 365 days)
 among all adolescents currently enrolled in HIV care were evaluated.
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> The methods described by Hussey and Hughes [35] based on a model with a random intercept
 were used to determine power assuming an evaluation with 24 clusters and 5 time points
 (including baseline). Twenty-four clinics were included to account for a possible 15% drop-
 out without replacement. As a small proportion of the adolescents enrolled in HIV care at
 each site would be newly enrolled or recently re-engaged in care, the minimum number of rec-
 ords per clinic was estimated for 80% power to detect a 15% difference between control and
 intervention periods (i.e. 75% versus 90%) assuming a coefficient of variation k of 0.25 and cal-
 culated power for a two-tailed test with α = 0.05. Based on relevant published data [2], 75% of
 adolescents in the control period were assumed to return to clinic after first visit. An estimated
 minimum of 5 adolescents per clinic per time point were needed under these assumptions.
 
<section> Randomization and sequence generation
 
<section> Facility clusters were randomized to the sequence in which they received the intervention. In
 this one-way cross-over design, all 24 sites eventually received the intervention. Groups of
 clinics were randomized to one of four intervention waves using stratified randomization
 according to region and by facility size. Facility size was defined as ‘high volume’, more than
 73 YLHIV enrolled and medium volume, 73 or fewer YLHIV enrolled, based on the median,
 to ensure balance of characteristics in each wave [36]. The study statistician generated the ran-
 domization assignment for each clinic using Microsoft Excel. Study staff were not blinded to
 randomization so that they could schedule and implement the training. Facilities were not
 informed which wave they were in until it was time to schedule that wave.
 
<section> Statistical methods
 
<section> To estimate the effect of the intervention on the individual level, a generalized linear mixed
 regression model with a Poisson distribution and robust standard errors, allowing for random
 effects for clusters and fixed effects for time was used. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and
 95% confidence intervals at the 5% significance level (two-sided) for primary outcomes were
 estimated. Satisfaction with care used the same approach with a Gaussian distribution for lin-
 ear outcomes and adjusted for sex and age category (10–14, 15–19, 20–24). Analyses were con-
 ducted using Stata 17 (College Station, TX).
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Recruitment and enrollment
 
<section> Overall, 227 providers were screened for eligibility, 100% consented to participate, and 139
 participated in the intervention training. At baseline, 157 providers were enrolled, and new
 providers continued to be consented at enrolled sites immediately before their respective train-
 ing wave. Medical records covering July 2016—March 2020 were abstracted for 4,595 YLHIV
 with 44,622 visits. Although YLHIV EMR data through December 2020 was planned to be
 included, outcome monitoring was stopped in March 2020 due to the influence of the
 COVID-19 pandemic on clinic attendance.

<section> Baseline characteristics
 
<section> Among the 24 participating facilities, 9 (38%) were in Nairobi, 7 (29%) in Kiambu, 4 (17%) in
 Kisumu, and 4 (17%) in Homa Bay county. Most (n = 10, 42%) were sub-county level hospi-
 tals, with 5 (21%) county-level hospitals or higher, and 8 (33%) health centers (Table 3). At
 baseline, facilities reported a median number of 1,707 clients enrolled in HIV care, including
 median of 83 YLHIV. Prior to start of study activities, 5 facilities (21%) had participated in any
 previous AFHS training.
 Among 139 HCWs completing the training, 135 participants completed demographic sur-
 veys. They were a median age of 33 years and 72% female. Most (42%) were counselors, clinical
 officers (28%), and nurses (26%). HCWs reported a median of 3 years of experience caring for
 YLHIV (IQR = 1–5) and half (50%) had received any prior training in AFHS (S1 Data).
 Among 6,043 YLHIV in care during the study time frame, 1,448 who were continuing care
 were excluded and the primary analysis was restricted to 4,595 YLHIV: 3,540 newly enrolled
 and 1,055 recently returned clients (Table 4). The median number of YLHIV per facility clus-
 ter was 218 (IQR = 107–243). Most YLHIV (65%) were age 20–24, 24% were 15–19, and 11%
 were 10–14; 82% were female. Overall, 75% of newly enrolled and recently returned YLHIV

 returned for a second visit within 90 days of their first visit on record (range across all facili-
 ties = 49.8% to 93.8%).
 Early engagement in care
 Among the 4,595 adolescents and youth across 24 clusters, YLHIV presenting for care during
 the exposed period had similar probability of return for a second visit as those who presented
 during unexposed periods [74% in exposed, 75% in unexposed group; adjusted prevalence ratio
 (aPR) = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.88–1.02] (Table 5). There was a trend for overall
 improved retention over time (global Wald p = 0.10) with significant improvement comparing
 baseline engagement to wave 2 (aPR = 1.08, 95%CI = 1.00–1.16) and to wave 3 (aPR = 1.15,
 95%CI = 1.04–1.27). Newly enrolled clients had significantly higher engagement compared to
 those who had previous gaps in care across all time periods (aPR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.05–1.33).
 Sensitivity analyses restricted to 10–19 year old YLHIV and among all YLHIV, including those
 continuing in care, were similarly null when comparing exposed and unexposed time periods
 (aPR = 0.91, 95%CI = 0.81–1.04 and aPR = 0.98, 95%CI = 0.90–1.07 respectively).

<section> other support person. YLHIV reported general overall satisfaction, with a median score of 4
 baseline at 5 at the end of wave 3. The largest differences were seen in the very satisfied cate-
 gory, with 47% reporting being very satisfied with care at baseline and 78% being very satisfied
 at the end of wave 3. Those presenting for care during exposed time periods had higher satis-
 faction (69.8% very satisfied) than those who were unexposed to trained providers (60.4% very
 satisfied), however in models adjusted for time, intervention exposure was not significantly
 associated with increased satisfaction (adjusted coefficient = -0.06, 95%CI = -0.19–0.07).

<section> Nine months after each training wave, we assessed whether trained providers were still practic-
 ing at their respective study sites. Overall, 54% (75/139) were still working at the same facility
 (facility-specific range: 20%-100%).
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> This stepped wedge randomized trial of a standardized patient training intervention was
 highly acceptable and improved provider confidence in care of YLHIV [37], however it did 
<section> not result in improved early engagement in care among YLHIV. Several measurement chal-
 lenges limited ability to detect effectiveness on the YLHIV population including substantial
 temporal changes in study outcomes, truncated final wave ascertainment of YLHIV measures
 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and turnover of trained HCWs resulting in diffusion of the
 intervention across sites.
 Encouragingly, we found significant improvements over time in both retention and satisfac-
 tion with care outcomes, suggesting that Kenya’s national investment in adolescent-friendly care
 is contributing to improved YLHIV outcomes. During the trial period Kenya’s National AIDS
 and STD Control Programme launched a 2015 Adolescent Package of Care which aimed to mini-
 mize barriers and improve health service provision for adolescents [38,39], the Ministry of Health
 issued updated 2016 national guidance for adolescent friendly services [14], and PEPFAR sus-
 tained and prioritized investment in study counties and adolescent populations [40–42]. The sub-
 sequent 2018 Kenya Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (KENPHIA) found that
 adolescent (15–24 years) viral suppression was 79% compared to adult suppression at 72% [43].
 is possible that these national gains contributed to dilution of the overall intervention effect.
 We also found that those with previous gaps in care were more likely to be lost to follow up
 again. This may have been in part because of longer visit intervals, though the study period
 pre-dated roll out of differentiated care and standardized longer visit intervals. It is also likely
 that adolescents have longer visit intervals related to school attendance. Previous gaps in care,
 however, could be a signal for health providers to allocate more intensive support services to
 prevent future loss to care.
 At the individual level, YLHIV face numerous barriers to adherence and engagement in care,
 including depression, stigma, and other psychosocial factors [44–46]. While evidence suggests
 that investment in adolescent friendly services addresses many of these barriers and contributes
 to improved clinical outcomes among YLHIV [47–50], interventions for more challenging men-
 tal health conditions are still largely lacking for this population [51]. It is also possible that
 YLHIV in the intervention period no longer received exposure to the intervention due to the
 large degree of HCW turnover. Shifting training delivery to pre-service settings for all new
 HCWs may be useful to ensure consistent training coverage in priority topics and skills. In addi-
 tion, evaluation of a more proximal measures (provider communication skills, judgmental behav-
 ior, or adherence to guidelines) or linking trained HCW with specific YLHIV in analyses rather
 than assessing clinic-level effect could enable a clearer understanding of intervention effect.
 This study was unique in that we attempted to determine whether an SP training interven-
 tion had a long-term patient effect using a stepped wedge RCT design. While SPs are increas-
 ingly used to assess quality of care in low-resource settings [52–58], studies of patient actor
 training interventions have primarily taken place in high-resource settings with proximal out-
 comes of provider skill or performance [19,59,60]. Indeed, our intervention was effective in
 improving self-rated provider skills [32,37]. Our use of routine electronic medical records as
 tool to assess patient outcomes was also innovative. Although a promising approach to mea-
 sure trial and program outcomes, there were numerous challenges with completeness of EMR
 data and implementation of EMR systems. Next visit dates were not an established entry at the
 time of the study, thus assumptions had to be made about expected return dates. Similarly, dis-
 ruptions in use of the 4 different electronic platforms across 6 implementing partners and 24
 clinics, incompleteness of clinical variables such as viral load and adherence in the EMR.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> In conclusion, the standardized patient actor training intervention did not result in a measur-
 able effect on adolescent satisfaction or early engagement in care among YLHIV in Kenya. 
<section> There was however high acceptability among health providers, and previous analyses demon-
 strated improvements in provider confidence and performance. Future research could target
 more proximal measures of patient-centered care as well as effectiveness for other key popula-
 tions or other care systems. Training HCWs in their pre-service, rather than in-service, period
 may address facility turnover however may need to be reinforced over time with evolving
 guidelines and priorities.
