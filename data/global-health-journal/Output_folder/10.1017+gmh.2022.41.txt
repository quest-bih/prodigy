<section> Introduction
 
<section> Over 100 million family members worldwide are estimated to be affected by the addictive beha-
 viours of a relative, and the negative impact is similar in family members across the world
 (Copello et al., 2010a, 2010b; Orford et al., 2013b). There has been a substantial increase in
 alcohol users over the years in India, with the annual alcohol consumption rates having
 increased by 38% between 2010 and 2017 (from 4.3 to 5.9 litres per adult) (Manthey et al.,
 2019). This increase will have caused a corresponding rise in the prevalence of affected family
 members (AFMs), and this will be largely hidden because AFMs are a ‘silent group’. The experi-
 ences of living with a person with drinking problems may make family members vulnerable to
 mental ill-health including mood and substance use disorders, trauma and stress-related con-
 ditions (Patel, 2007; Ray et al., 2009; Copello et al., 2010a, 2010b; Orford et al., 2013b). The
 limited number of studies from India demonstrate a high burden of alcohol use on families,

 challenges of inaccessibility for the majority of the population (Benegal et al., 2009).
 Consequentially, AFMs experience high unmet needs as they play a peripheral role in formal
 care and are neglected because services are not equipped to address their problems (Copello
 and Orford, 2002; Orford et al., 2013b; Orford, 2017). 
<section> The 5-Step Method is an evidence-based brief psychosocial
 intervention for helping AFMs and is derived from the theoretical
 framework of the Stress-Strain-Coping-Support (SSCS) model
 (Velleman et al., 2008; Copello et al., 2009, 2010a, 2010b;
 Orford et al., 2010a, 2010b; Rey et al., 2010; Velleman et al.,
 
<section> 2011; Orford et al., 2013a). The 5-Step Method was adapted
 and evaluated in the SAFE (Supporting Addiction Affected
 Families Effectively) program, using the Medical Research
 Council’s guidance on developing and evaluating complex inter-
 ventions (Craig et al., 2008; Rane et al., 2017; Church et al.,
 
<section> 2018; Nadkarni et al., 2019). This paper describes the second
 phase of the SAFE program, and its objectives are to test the feasi-
 bility and acceptability of processes for a definitive randomised
 controlled trial (RCT) (e.g. recruitment, data collection, interven-
 tion delivery); test the indicative impact of the intervention in
 improving clinical outcomes in AFMs; and understand how the
 intervention can be further refined, based on these findings.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> Parallel arm, single-blind, feasibility RCT. The CONSORT state-
 ment can be accessed in supplementary material.
 
<section> Setting
 
<section> Communities in four sub-districts of Goa, India (population 1.4
 million). Unlike most of India, Goa has a ‘more liberal, wet cul-
 ture’ with the drinking patterns characterised by low rates of
 abstinence, and a high prevalence of hazardous drinking in
 men (Silva et al., 2003; D’costa et al., 2006; Pillai et al., 2013).
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> The sources of recruitment were referrals from community gate-
 keepers (e.g. professional and community health workers, priests,
 village council members), and self-referrals (through word-of-
 mouth publicity and advertisements in healthcare and commu-
 nity settings). The inclusion criteria were (1) family member
 (⩾18 years) reporting that the relative’s drinking had been a
 major source of distress in the previous 6 months, (2) the relative
 had been drinking problematically at some point during the pre-
 vious 6 months, (3) the family member and the relative who had
 been drinking problematically had been living in the same house
 at some point in the previous 6 months, or had face-to-face con-
 tact at least three times a week. Eligible participants who gave
 informed consent were administered the baseline assessments
 and randomised to receive either SAFE or enhanced usual care
 (EUC).
 
<section> Randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding
 An independent researcher developed a randomisation code using
 computer-generated random numbers. Sequentially Numbered
 Opaque Sealed Envelopes were used to maximise allocation con-
 cealment. The envelope was opened only after the participant
 information was written on its cover, which helped create an
 audit trail. The 3-month outcome assessments were administered
 by research assistants, who had no previous engagement in the
 trial, and were ‘blind’ to the treatment allocation. The primary
 assessments; and participants were requested not to disclose
 their allocation status during the outcome interview.
 
<section> Interventions
 
<section> The intervention arm received SAFE, a contextually adapted
 version of the 5-Step Method (Nadkarni et al., 2019) (Fig. 1),
 delivered in five sessions over 10 weeks. The intervention was
 delivered face-to-face, at a mutually convenient venue (e.g.
 home). The control arm received EUC, which consisted of an
 information leaflet highlighting the nature and impact of alcohol-
 related problems, and sources of help for the AFM. In both arms,
 we referred participants with serious concerns (e.g. suicidal
 ideation) for further specialised treatment or urgent care.
 
<section> Interventionists
 
<section> We recruited lay counsellors through referrals from community gate-
 keepers, advertisements and word-of-mouth publicity. The lay coun-
 sellors had no previous formal training in the field of mental health,
 were from the same community as the target population and were flu-
 ent in the vernacular languages. The lay counsellors were chosen after
 a thorough competency evaluation process and underwent rigorous
 training and supervision. Training entailed expert-led sessions on
 the 5-Step Method, followed by refresher trainings to address any
 identified learning needs. Supervision included both, individual
 and group, peer and expert-led supervision, where the counsellors
 discussed ratings on randomly selected recorded sessions on the
 SAFE therapy quality scale developed for the study, and also dis-
 cussed feedback on challenges and barriers during sessions.
 
<section> Baseline assessments
 
<section> All eligible participants who consented to participate were adminis-
 tered the following baseline assessments: socio-demographic ques-
 tionnaire, Coping Questionnaire (CQ) (Orford et al., 2005)
 measuring the AFM’s coping strategies, Symptom Rating Test
 (SRT) (Kellner and Sheffield, 1973) measuring physical and psy-
 chological symptoms, Family Member Impact (FMI) questionnaire
 (Orford et al., 2005) measuring the impact of the alcohol use on
 various aspects of the AFM’s life, and Alcohol, Drugs and the
 Family Social Support Scale (ADF-SSS) (Toner and Velleman,
 2014) measuring social support for the AFM. The CQ, SRT, FMI
 and ADF-SSS are standardised tools and have undergone rigorous
 psychometric testing for reliability and validity.
 
<section> Process indicators
 
<section> Process evaluation was conducted to examine acceptability and
 feasibility of recruitment procedures and treatment, fidelity of
 implementation, moderation of impact and contextual factors
 associated with outcomes.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome was the difference in mean SRT scores at
 months. The secondary outcomes were mean differences in CQ,
 FMI and ADF-SSS scores at 3 months. Lower scores on all the
 measures, except the ADF-SSS, denote fewer symptoms, fewer
 attempts at coping and fewer negative incidents impacting the
 family member, respectively (Kellner and Sheffield, 1973;
 Orford et al., 2005; Toner and Velleman, 2014). Other secondary
 outcomes included experience of physical and sexual violence. We

 November 2016. The trial was completed in November 2016
 when the 3-month outcome assessment ended.
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> We aimed to recruit 50 participants in each arm, which was
 assumed to be sufficient to examine feasibility and acceptability
 of the intervention and trial procedures.
 
<section> Statistical methods
 
<section> Quantitative analyses were performed using STATA (version 14).
 The primary analysis was intention-to-treat at the 3-month end-
 point, and secondary analyses at the 3-month endpoints, adjusted
 for baseline values. Per-protocol analysis was conducted in those
 who completed the trial. Missing outcome data were imputed by
 multiple imputation using baseline characteristics. An estimate of
 the effects of the intervention (relative to EUC), in terms of effect
 sizes are reported as crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and
 standardized mean differences ( S M D with 95% confidence inter-
 vals, as appropriate.
 
<section> Ethics
 
<section> Ethical approval was sought from the Institutional Review Board
 of the host institution and the Indian Council of Medical Research
 (reference number: UB_2016_022).
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Between May and August 2016, we recruited 101 participants in
 the study, of whom 51 were randomly allocated to the SAFE
 arm and 50 to the EUC arm (Fig. 2).
 
<section> Baseline characteristics
 
<section> All of our participants were female apart from two who were both
 fathers of sons with drinking problems (Tables 1 and 2). Baseline
 characteristics were similar between the two arms, except for
 educational status and help-seeking by the drinking relative. A sig-
 nificantly higher proportion of those in the SAFE arm completed pri-
 mary/secondary education compared to those in the EUC arm
 
<section> (90.2% v. 74%, p = 0.03). About 20% reported that their drinking
 relative had received treatment in the previous 3 months, and
 these were disproportionately recruited into the treatment arm
 
<section> (27% v. 10%, p = 0.02). Ninety-six participants (95%) completed out-
 come assessments (96% in the SAFE arm and 94% in the EUC arm).
 
<section> Experiences of family members
 
<section> Across both arms, as reported by the AFMs at baseline, the average
 duration of the relatives’ drinking was 14.7 ( S D 10.0) years, and the
 average duration of problematic drinking behaviours was 9.1 ( S D
 7.9) years (Tables 1 and 2). At baseline, 28.7% of the participants
 expressed being ‘satisfied’ with their relationship, 18.8% reported
 being neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 48.5% expressed being 
<insert> Fig. 2. CONSORT flowchart for reporting pilot and feasibility trials’ 
<iend>

 dissatisfied. In total, 27.7% of participants reported being physically
 abused, and 9.9% reported being sexually abused. Only 5.9% of the
 participants had received any form of help in the past 3 months for
 the difficulties that they were experiencing in relation to the drink-
 ing behaviours of their relative. There were no significant differ-
 ences between arms on satisfaction with relationship, experience
 of violence and help-seeking by the participant.
 
<section> Indicative impact of the intervention
 
<section> At follow-up, the mean SRT, CQ, FMI and ADF-SSS scores were
 all higher in the SAFE arm compared to the EUC arm, however,
 the between-group adjusted mean differences were only statistic-
 ally significant for ADF-SSS scores (AMD −6.05, 95% CI −10.98
 to −1.12, p 0.02) (Tables 3–6). The SSCS model suggests that
 higher scores on each of the outcome measures (except
 ADF-SSS) suggest worse outcomes. Hence, the only outcome
 which went in the positive direction in the SAFE arm was
 ADF-SSS (i.e. social support). In comparing the change scores
 at 3 months (i.e. extent of change from baseline to outcome
 per arm), the change in CQ and ADF-SSS was greater in the
 SAFE arm, with the former changing in a negative direction
 (i.e. higher score indicating worse coping) and the latter chan-
 ging in a positive direction (i.e. higher score indicating better
 social support). The change in SRT and FMI was greater in
 the EUC arm, with both changing in a positive direction (i.e.
 lower SRT score indicating lesser strain and lower FMI score
 indicating lesser stress). However, the between-group adjusted
 mean differences were not significant for any of these outcomes.
 In comparing sub-scale scores, there was a significant increase
 only in ‘engaged style’ of coping and ‘positive functional sup-
 port’ in the SAFE arm. With regards to the experience of
 abuse, a greater (although non-significant) proportion of parti-
 cipants reported experiencing physical abuse in the EUC arm
 than in the SAFE arm (21.3% v. 12.5%, aOR 1.86, 95% CI
 
<section> 0.59–0.84, p = 0.29), while for sexual abuse, the difference was
 of 2.9% in the EUC arm v. 2.6% in the SAFE arm (aOR 1.27,
 
<section> 95% CI 0.08–21.28, p = 0.86).

 Acceptability and feasibility of the intervention
 One hundred fifteen participants were referred to the trial; 95 were
 referred by community gatekeepers and 20 (17.4%) were self-
 referred (Tables 7 and 8). One hundred eleven were approached
 to assess eligibility, and 102 completed eligibility assessment.
 One hundred one participants were eligible, consented to random-
 isation and completed baseline assessments. Of the 51 participants
 who entered treatment, 40 (78%) completed treatment/had a
 planned discharge (i.e. all five sessions). There were no statistically
 significant differences in baseline characteristics between those
 who completed treatment and those who did not. Of the
 remainder (n = 11), three dropped out before the first session,
 five dropped out after the second session and three dropped out
 after the third session. The average number of sessions conducted
 was 4.25. The mean duration of sessions was 53 min. The mean
 duration reduced from session 1 to session 3 before increasing
 again in the final session. For the majority of the participants,
 the first session was conducted in the clinic, and this proportion
 gradually reduced over the duration of treatment, with most ses-
 sions being conducted at participants’ homes by the fourth session.
 Finally, the mean number of days between sessions increased as
 the treatment progressed from session 1 to session 4 (from 16 to
 31 days). There were seven serious adverse events (three in the

 reported to be experienced by other family members).
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> Our pilot RCT has demonstrated that the intervention has good
 acceptability and feasibility, but has only shown positive indicative
 impact on one of the social support measures: positive functional
 support. These findings are consistent with our previous work,
 where we conducted a case series with a uncontrolled treatment
 cohort of AFMs, and again found positive changes only in social
 support [in fact, that study showed positive changes in both posi-
 tive functional support and positive alcohol, drugs and families
 specific support, as well as an increase in strain and engaged cop-
 ing (Nadkarni et al., 2019)]. However, these findings are incon-
 sistent with most other 5-Step Method work outside India. In
 almost all major evaluations of the intervention, the 5-Step
 Method has led to significant reductions in strain, and a reduction

 in engaged and tolerant coping (Copello et al., 2010a, 2010b). A
 key question therefore is how to account for these differences.
 One potential attribution is that they might be related to how cul-
 ture influences the experiences of AFMs. It has been suggested
 that different cultures and contexts influence the accumulated
 burden that AFMs hold, and the social support available for
 them; and that these differences may influence the core AFM
 experience (Orford, 2017). This is especially true for our setting
 where our previous work has demonstrated both high levels of
 burden and the inaccessibility of effective social support
 (Church et al., 2018).
 The high uptake and completion of the intervention suggest that
 it was acceptable to family members; and indicate that there was a
 felt need for the intervention, it was possible to identify AFMs
 through gatekeeper or self-referrals, and it was acceptable to parti-
 cipants. Also, it implies that a program focused on AFMs can be
 implemented in this context with good initiation and follow-up
 rates. Further, in resource-constrained settings, it is feasible and
 acceptable to train lay counsellors to deliver a psychosocial inter-
 vention for families in community settings. From the perspective
 of evaluation research, it is possible to efficiently implement proce-
 dures that are critical in conducting a definitive RCT of the SAFE
 intervention, which had been our planned next step.
 However, despite the fact that feasibility studies are not pow-
 ered to assess effectiveness, our quantitative findings raise several

<section> questions. Does the fact that, for the participants receiving SAFE,
 stress and strain did not significantly reduce, and there was an
 increased use of coping methods which studies in other countries
 have suggested may be less helpful ways of coping, suggests that
 the intervention may (or does) not work in our context?
 Although our study cannot empirically answer that question, we
 can speculate about a number of potential explanations. First,
 the philosophical focus of the intervention may not be the best
 ‘cultural fit’ for the Indian context. The intervention is focused
 solely on empowering family members in their own right, and
 is thus a significant shift from the traditional neglect or token
 involvement of family members to direct engagement/focus on
 family members. In a ‘collectivist’ culture such as India which
 ascribes greater importance to the family as a unit, the focus of
 the SAFE intervention on the individual may have led to a mis-
 match. To illustrate this point, we would like to draw upon one
 of our anecdotal experiences from our process and qualitative
 work. AFMs strongly asserted that although they were burdened,
 their primary interest was not to receive help for themselves;
 instead their preference was that their drinking relative should
 engage in any form of treatment, and change his drinking beha-
 viours, which would make ‘all their problems go away’. Hence, it
 may be that AFMs in our context retained a focus on the drinking
 relative and did not see the appropriateness or the possible useful-
 ness of an intervention which might exclusively support the

 AFMs. The intervention was developed and has been used else-
 where in order to help AFMs in their own right by focusing on
 their coping and support systems; and it is possible that the
 AFMs whom we recruited in this context did not want this or
 understand its potential helpfulness, and instead wanted an
 intervention which would persuade their drinking relatives to
 seek treatment. As a result, by focusing on how they as AFMs
 were experiencing the impact of their drinking relative, our inter-
 vention may have increased stress and strain in family members.
 Another possibility could be that the health of these AFMs did
 not improve because their situation remained the same: the
 drinker had not stopped drinking (which was their primary per-
 ceived need), and hence their perception might have been that
 ‘nothing had changed’ and hence they did not change either.
 A related point is that this sample scored considerably lower
 on especially stress (FMI), but also on strain (SRT) than have
 other samples drawn from other countries and cultures
 [pre-treatment FMI scores in other countries are typically in
 the range of 30, whereas pre-treatment FMI scores in this sample
 were 19.84 (SAFE arm) and 21.74 (EUC arm); pre-treatment SRT
 scores range from 28.5 to 36.8, whereas here they were 23.25
 (SAFE) and 21.48 (EUC)] (Copello et al., 2010a, 2010b). The cul-
 ture in India creates a situation where women are made to ‘accept
 their lot’ and as a result accept that they have to live with men
 who drink too much, and that sometimes they suffer as a result
 of that; and hence many women are relatively fatalistic about
 this (Stanley, 2012). Perhaps, by getting AFMs to undergo five
 sessions of a counselling intervention which got them to reflect
 on this situation, and by discussing change, it may have allowed
 these AFMs to realise that the impact and the effects on them-
 selves were even worse than they had previously considered.
 Related to this, the intervention focuses on ‘alternatives to current
 ways of coping’ but in the study context it is possible that many of
 these AFMs might have felt that their alternatives were so limited
 that they could not change their situations. Hence our interven-
 tion may have raised awareness and self-reflection (e.g. regarding
 the negative impacts and their own responses), without alleviating
 any problems (e.g. getting the husband to stop drinking; or gen-
 erating reasonable alternatives to current ways of coping). Again,
 there is some corroboration for this view, in that the style of cop-
 ing which increased in this sample was engaged coping, one in
 which the focus is very much on the drinker and the drinking.
 One further alternative explanation could be that the brief
 nature of our intervention was not adequate to lead to any longer-
 term positive changes in AFMs, especially in a context where ‘talk-
 ing therapies’ are a novel and quite alien concept (Murthy, 2014).
 A different explanation might relate to the competency of
 counsellors in delivering the 5-Step Method, which in previous
 studies has been delivered by specialists (Copello et al., 2009;
 Velleman et al., 2011). It could be argued that the treatment qual-
 ity could have been affected because the delivery agents were not
 trained professionals, but were lay counsellors. However, there is
 an extensive evidence base of the effectiveness of non-specialist
 health worker-delivered mental health interventions in LMICs
 (van Ginneken et al., 2013; Nadkarni et al., 2017; Patel et al.,
 
<section> 2017; Singla et al., 2017).
 Our recruitment strategy may also explain the characteristics
 of participants, and the mixed results we found. We recruited par-
 ticipants through self and gatekeeper referrals, which meant that
 our sample would have included both those who were treatment
 seekers, and those who were not seeking treatment for their
 experiences or problems. Recruiting non-treatment seekers
 meant that there may have been a sub-group of participants
 who were less likely to fully engage in treatment, and report posi-
 tive change (the lower levels of reported stress and strain offer
 some corroboration for this). Finally, it may be that the quantita-
 tive measures we have used are not culturally sensitive and
 adequate enough to capture actual and relevant changes that
 AFMs experience in their lives.
 The second fundamental question is about the differential dir-
 ection of change across the various domains of the experience of
 
<section> AFMs: Why did only social support scores increase? One of the
 predictors of future help-seeking is past experience of accessing
 help. In an Australian study, AFMs reported that positive help-
 seeking experiences in the past made them more likely to access
 services (McCann and Lubman, 2018). Our intervention provided
 AFMs with a safe space where they felt heard, and attempted to
 empower them to cope better; but for many this was the first
 such help that they had ever accessed. It is possible that the posi-
 tive experiences that AFMs experienced during the SAFE sessions
 may have increased the likelihood of further help-seeking and
 hence led to an increase in social support scores.
 Despite the improvement in perceived support, there was no
 positive change in the other domains of the SSCS model, and
 this could suggest a number of possibilities. One is that positive
 impact in this sample may only be seen over a longer time
 span. Alternatively, the available social support structures were
 perhaps not adequate, in terms of whether these were accessible,
 or even the quality of support offered. Hence, although there may
 have been increased support, the impact of the support in terms
 of improving the situation of AFMs may not have been positive.
 Given the relatively inextricable contexts that AFMs come from,
 this increased support may have not led to any significant change
 in the stress, strain and coping of AFMs. Finally, the increased
 support reported by the AFMs could actually be the support pro-
 vided by lay counsellors through the SAFE intervention. This
 explanation is also likely given that our previous work has demon-
 strated the inaccessibility of social support (Church et al., 2018).
 To conclude, there are five major implications of our results.
 First, the fast recruitment and high acceptance rates for the inter-
 vention demonstrate that there is a great need for interventions
 aimed at AFMs in this context; and the high adherence rates dem-
 onstrate that the AFMs found the experience of receiving the
 intervention relevant and helpful. Both our anecdotal and quali-
 tative data suggest that the large majority of the AFMs who
 received the intervention felt that they needed an intervention,
 stated that they felt better as a result of it and appreciated their
 meetings with their counsellors. These findings then reinforce 
<section> what is known from other studies in India and elsewhere: that
 AFMs carry a high burden and a there is a major need for inter-
 ventions to reduce this burden.
 Second, we now have a better understanding of how this inter-
 vention worked in the setting. We found that AFMs in both arms
 showed at the time of the 3-month follow-up greater levels of stress
 and strain than at baseline, and that those in the intervention arm
 both increased the amount of engaged coping they used and
 reported greater changes in positive social support. Clearly this
 study was not powered to demonstrate significant results, but
 these preliminary findings strongly suggest that this intervention
 did not lead to expected changes – that is to reductions in especially
 strain (symptoms) and in AFMs generally feeling more empowered
 and more ‘in control’ of their situation. The rise in engaged coping
 suggests instead that, by focusing their attention on their situations,
 the intervention caused these AFMs to attempt to intervene at an
 even higher level than they had done before, yet with them still
 not being able to change the situation.
 This relates to a third implication; that the intervention did not
 address the most pressing problem for these AFMs, which was to
 ensure that their relative with a drinking problem received effect-
 ive treatment and stopped drinking. In some ways this is not an
 uncommon issue within the 5-Step Method, where many AFMs
 come for help with a focus on their problem relative. But in
 this context, it proved extremely challenging to assist these
 AFMs to see that if they were able to change their own behaviour,
 and to develop alternative ways of dealing with the problem, this
 might improve relationships in the family, and reduce their stress
 and strain. Our counsellors reported that many AFMs seemed
 extremely ‘stuck’, or alternatively lived in contexts where change
 seemed exceedingly difficult, and found it very problematic to
 generate alternative coping strategies, even with considerable
 help from the counsellors. One solution to this might be to
 broaden the scope of such interventions, for instance, planning
 horizontal approaches to care, primarily addressing the needs of
 both, the relative with the drinking problem and their AFMs.
 Keeping in line with this proposed shift of focus, there is scope
 to explore the relevance of offering 5-Step Method with a supple-
 mented focus on the relative with the drinking problem, as well as
 other systemic and collaborative approaches to family-based inter-
 ventions such as the Community Reinforcement and Family
 Training where family members and their relative with the drink-
 ing problem are jointly engaged (Copello et al., 2005).
 Fourth, the findings from this pilot RCT corroborated our
 earlier findings from both our formative work and other work
 undertaken within India, which is that domestic violence is a
 major and unresolved problem for many AFMs. Some of this vio-
 lence is alcohol-related; but some is simply endemic to a culture
 where violence against women is an accepted and often largely
 ignored part of the landscape. Further work is needed to create
 interventions for AFMs which address this wide range of needs
 and complex situations (Copello et al., 2006). This point leads
 into a wider implication from this study: how socio-cultural fac-
 tors influence the impact of interventions. Almost all of our par-
 ticipants were women, who reported experiences which clearly
 emphasised how patriarchal structures continue to disadvantage
 them (e.g. the high prevalence of violence). Although the focus
 of this intervention was on empowerment, it was not uncommon
 for women to express their needs through the lens of their part-
 ners and children, to report multiple burdens as a result of assum-
 ing the primary caregiver’s role, to report various expressions of
 violence, and to report poor social support (Church et al., 2018;
 Nadkarni et al., 2019). It is important to note that these experiences
 are not unique to Goa: previous studies with AFMs have found simi-
 lar stories, particularly from women (Rey et al., 2010; Stanley, 2012).
 This interplay of gender with the experience of being an AFM sug-
 gests the need for the inclusion of other perspectives (e.g. a feminist
 understanding) in planning psychosocial interventions (Orford
 et al., 2010b). An example of this feminist approach is from a
 Mexican qualitative study with AFMs, where female participants
 experienced positive change in their lives by learning how to change
 their locus of control (moving from ‘women being objects to subjects
 of their own destiny’) (Rey et al., 2010).
 Some limitations of our study include one of the ways in which
 we recruited participants (through self-referrals), which may
 result in a non-representative sample, as participants who volun-
 teer for a trial may disproportionately possess characteristics
 related to the outcome. Another important limitation was the reli-
 ance on self-reports for outcome evaluation, which introduce an
 element of subjectivity, and are prone to response bias.
 The following characteristics are key strengths of our study.
 First, we focused on a target population that is considered to be
 a ‘hidden’ or ‘silent’ and hard-to-reach group. The primary plat-
 form through which we recruited our sample was the community,
 which expanded the potential reach of our study, and improved
 the representativeness of our sample. Second, to the best of our
 knowledge, this is the first study that has systematically examined
 an evidence-based intervention for AFMs ‘in their own right’ in
 the Indian context. Third, our community-based participatory
 research approach allowed for a range of community stakeholders
 to inform the design, conduct and evaluation of the intervention.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> Our study aids the process of translational research by adopting
 frameworks that have an established evidence base and imple-
 menting these frameworks in a culturally appropriate manner to
 newer underserved populations. Given our mixed findings, fur-
 ther work is required to unpack how the intervention affects
 AFMs and what further adaptations are required to make the
 intervention relevant to the Indian context.
