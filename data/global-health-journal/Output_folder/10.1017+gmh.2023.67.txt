 This cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in a rural district of Ethiopia. Fifty-four
 sub-districts were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the facility-based care [FBC] plus CBR arm and the
 FBC alone arm. Lay workers delivered CBR over 12 months. We assessed food insecurity (self-
 reported hunger), underweight (BMI< 18.5 kg/m2), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and alcohol
 use disorder (AUDIT ≥ 8) at 6 and 12 months. Seventy-nine participants with schizophrenia in
 24 sub-districts were assigned to CBR plus FBC and 87 participants in 24 sub-districts were
 assigned to FBC only. There was no evidence of an intervention effect on food insecurity (aOR
 0.52, 95% CI 0.16–1.67; p = 0.27), underweight (aOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.17–1.12; p = 0.08), alcohol
 use disorder (aOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.24–2.74; p = 0.74) or depressive symptoms (adjusted mean
 difference 0.06, 95% CI 1.35, 1.22; p = 0.92). Psychosocial interventions in low-resource
 settings should support access to treatment amongst people with schizophrenia, and further
 research should explore how impacts on economic, physical and mental health outcomes can be
 achieved.

 support, help to access free medication and appointment reminders, should be developed as a
 key focus of psychosocial interventions to ensure all people with schizophrenia experience these
 benefits. However, these approaches should be delivered in parallel to efforts to support social

<section> Introduction
 
<section> The potentially serious impacts of schizophrenia on functioning,
 livelihoods, and mortality are well-documented globally (Asher
 et al., 2017a, 2018a; Tirfessa et al., 2019). Alcohol use disorder,
 depression, undernutrition and household food insecurity are com-
 mon and interlinked states amongst people with schizophrenia in
 low-income countries that may be modified by access to psycho-
 social support. Co-morbid alcohol use disorder was estimated to
 affect 29% of people with schizophrenia in a rural district in
 Ethiopia (Hanlon et al., 2019). As well as increasing the risk of
 all-cause mortality (Correll et al., 2022), alcohol use disorder is
 associated with higher rates of suicide, incarceration, homelessness,
 physical health problems, and treatment drop out amongst people
 with schizophrenia (Bouchard et al., 2022). Over 50% of people
 with schizophrenia also experience depression and this is associated
 with poor quality of life, longer illness duration and more frequent
 psychotic episodes, substance use, as well as suicide (Gregory et al.,
 2017). Amongst people with severe mental illness in Ethiopia,
 depression and suicide attempts are more common in those with
 poorer functioning, poorer quality of life and alcohol or substance
 use disorder (Shibre et al., 2014; Fanta et al., 2020). In rural
 Ethiopia, severe household food insecurity, an important marker
 of poverty, was experienced by 33% of people with schizophrenia in
 a rural district (double that found in the general population
 (Tirfessa et al., 2017). This effect is likely to be due to difficulties
 pursuing livelihood activities, such as farming, in the face of func-
 tional impairments in people with schizophrenia, and time-
 consuming caregiving activities amongst family members
 (Tirfessa et al., 2019). Undernutrition, poorer living conditions,
 increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, and inability to access
 healthcare are all potential sequalae of household food insecurity
 (Berrington de Gonzalez et al., 2010; Teferra et al., 2011; Hailemi-
 chael et al., 2019).
 In Ethiopia, task-shared integrated care delivered by non-
 physicians in primary healthcare is safe and effective in reducing
 disability, symptoms, alcohol use disorder, depressive symptoms,
 suicide attempts, household food insecurity, as well as physical
 restraint, and discrimination in people with schizophrenia
 (Hanlon et al., 2019; Tirfessa et al., 2020; Hanlon et al., 2022).
 Psychosocial interventions and strategies such as community-
 based rehabilitation (CBR) are recommended to address the com-
 plex social, economic and clinical needs of individuals who have not
 responded to standard care in low and middle-income country
 (LMIC) contexts. We designed the Community-based Rehabilita-
 tion Intervention for people with Schizophrenia in Ethiopia (RISE)
 intervention to meet the needs of this group in a rural Ethiopian
 district (Asher et al., 2015). The primary aim of CBR was to improve
 functioning, that is to support individuals to develop the skills and
 confidence to perform their previous or desired roles and activities.
 We developed a theory of change to delineate the pathways through
 which we hypothesised improvements in functioning could be
 achieved (Asher et al., 2018b; Supplementary File 1). We identified
 intermediate outcomes to be: ‘improved understanding about men-
 tal illness and human rights’, ‘improved family stability and care’,
 ‘increased access to mental health care’, ‘reduced stigma and abuse’,
 ‘increased social inclusion’, ‘improved physical health’, ‘increased
 rather than microfinance schemes requiring external capital. The
 developing new models of community-based psychosocial support
 countries.
 
<section> income’, ‘reduced symptoms’, ‘increased involvement in decision-
 making’ and ‘increased self-esteem and hope’ (Asher et al., 2018b).
 We therefore designed the RISE CBR intervention to address all five
 pillars of the WHO’s CBR matrix: health, social, livelihoods,
 empowerment and education, to the extent possible with available
 resources (Asher et al., 2015). A broad range of needs could be
 addressed through optional modules including, for example,
 Improving physical health (health domain), Support returning to
 work (livelihoods domain), Dealing with stigma (empowerment
 domain), Taking part in community life (social domain) and
 Improving literacy (education domain), along with an underpin-
 ning emphasis on improving self-esteem and fostering a sense of
 hope. A structured community mobilisation component, including
 public awareness-raising talks, was delivered in parallel. We
 hypothesised that causal effects would likely be bi-directional with,
 for example, improved functioning predicted to positively impact
 on physical health. This could be due to increased farming activity
 resulting in greater food availability and improved nutrition; and
 also, greater income leading to poverty reduction.
 The main RISE trial analysis, which reported the pre-
 specified main outcomes, demonstrated that CBR as an adjunct
 to facility-based care (FBC) is effective in reducing disability at
 12 months in persons with schizophrenia who had disabling
 illness after 6 months of access to standard care (Asher et al.,
 2022). There were also beneficial impacts on symptom severity,
 caregiver tension and worrying, and in increasing anti-psychotic
 medication adherence and attendance to FBC. The impact of
 clinical or psychosocial interventions on nutritional status, sub-
 stance use or depressive symptoms in people with schizophrenia
 is rarely evaluated in LMIC, with the focus tending to be on
 functioning and symptoms (Chatterjee et al., 2014; Asher et al.,
 2017b; Li et al., 2018; Jordans et al., 2019; Shidhaye et al., 2019).
 In this article, we explore the effectiveness of CBR on the
 exploratory outcomes of depressive symptoms, alcohol use dis-
 order, underweight and household food insecurity. The aim of
 the current analysis is to aid in refining CBR for future imple-
 mentation by indicating its potential to influence these vulner-
 abilities.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design and participants
 
<section> The RISE cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in
 Sodo district, Gurage Zone, Southern Nations, Nationalities and
 Peoples’ Region in Ethiopia. The study protocol and main trial
 results were previously published (Asher et al., 2016, 2022). Sodo
 district has a total population of 170,000 people in 58 sub-districts.
 There are high levels of poverty and the main economic activity is
 subsistence farming and small-scale trading. Most of the popula-
 tion live in remote rural areas. Primary care is delivered by nurses
 and health officers at one primary hospital and seven health centres.
 Care costs are usually out-of-pocket with a fee waiver available for
 the poorest. The Ethiopian government does not provide social
 protection, such as disability grants or food subsidies, nor employ-
 ment opportunities, for people with mental illness. There are also 
<insert> Figure 1. Trial profile 
<iend>

 no non-governmental organisations providing such support in the
 study area.
 Randomisation units were sub-districts of Sodo district. In total,
 54 sub-districts were available after subtracting the four pilot sub-
 districts (Asher et al., 2018b; Figure 1). Sub-districts were excluded
 if no eligible participants were identified. People with suspected
 schizophrenia were identified by the Programme for Improving
 Mental Healthcare (PRIME) study in Sodo through key community
 informants who had received half a day of training in the typical
 presentations of schizophrenia (Hanlon et al., 2019). Trained psy-
 chiatric nurses then used the Operational Criteria for Research
 (OPCRIT) diagnostic interview (McGuffin et al., 1991) (which
 applies Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
 fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria), and those with a confirmatory
 diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited to the PRIME study. FBC
 was available for people in the PRIME study with a confirmed 
<section> diagnosis of schizophrenia. The PRIME study started 6 months
 before RISE trial recruitment. RISE study participants had therefore
 had the opportunity to access FBC for 6 months before being
 enrolled.
 RISE participants were recruited from two sources: (i) individuals
 who were participating in the PRIME study and (ii) individuals who
 had not participated in the PRIME study but had been identified by
 PRIME as having suspected schizophrenia. These participants had
 not attended FBC. Participants from the PRIME study were
 recruited at the PRIME 6-month data collection (or on a separate
 occasion if they did not attend) and individuals who were not
 participants in the PRIME study were recruited using the PRIME
 database of people with suspected schizophrenia. PRIME cohort
 study participants were prescreened by checking PRIME baseline
 data for a schizophrenia diagnosis. Participants meeting this criter-
 ion underwent full RISE eligibility assessment by the trial nurse using
 PRIME cohort 6-month data. Participants not in the PRIME cohort
 had an initial consent taken, before data was collected on the
 eligibility instruments, including the OPCRIT interview. The inclu-
 sion criteria were: In PRIME cohort study or not engaged in FBC but
 resident in Sodo district; diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective
 disorder or schizophreniform disorder; ≥18 years; resident in sub-
 district for 6 months and intending to stay; had a primary caregiver
 willing to participate; and ≥ 1 marker/s of severe, disabling or
 enduring illness (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded [BPRSE]
 score ≥ 52; or proxy or self-rated 36-item WHO Disability Assess-
 ment Schedule [WHODAS] 20 score ≥ 35; or continuous illness last
 6 months; or symptomatic ≥3 of last 6 months or Clinical Global
 Impression [CGI] severity score ≥ 3).
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 
<section> Randomisation was carried out before participant recruitment by
 an independent statistician using Stata version 14 (StataCorp,
 2015). A total of 54 subdistricts were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to
 either the intervention (CBR plus FBC group) or to the control
 group (FBC alone group). To prevent imbalance for potential
 confounding factors the statistician employed an optimization
 algorithm calculated for subdistrict mean WHODAS score at
 PRIME baseline and the potential number of participants per
 sub-district. They applied the procedure for each health centre
 and used a computer programme to randomly chose the allocation
 sequence from the set of optimal ones. The statistician was masked
 to the intervention/control label. Researchers responsible for iden-
 tifying and recruiting participants and collecting outcome data
 were masked to allocation status. All co-authors (except RB)
 remained masked until the final analysis was complete.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> FBC is a stepped care model. The majority of care was delivered in
 primary care, and comprised prescription of anti-psychotic medi-
 cation and psychoeducation by nurses and health officers trained
 for 2 weeks in the WHO mental health Gap Action Programme-
 Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) and supervised by a psychiatric
 nurse. Primary care staff could refer individuals to psychiatric
 nurse-led out-patient care (secondary care) or psychiatrist-led
 in-patient care (tertiary care) as required. Frequency of contact
 with FBC was determined by clinical need. Health extension work-
 ers in each sub-district were trained in awareness-raising on causes
 and treatment of mental disorders. A district-level community-
 advisory board oversaw implementation of the integrated FBC
 model.
 CBR was delivered by 11 CBR workers, each covering a catch-
 ment area of one, two or three sub-districts, linked to a health
 centre. CBR delivery commenced immediately after trial recruit-
 ment and lasted 12 months. CBR workers supported a median of
 seven participants (range 4–11). CBR workers were lay persons
 recruited from the local area with at least 10 years of education but
 no prior experience in delivering mental healthcare. They received
 5 weeks initial training in CBR delivery, guided by a manual,
 including basic counselling and problem-solving techniques
 (Asher et al., 2021). This was followed by monthly half-day top-
 up training during intervention delivery. Training was split
 between classroom teaching (role-plays, discussions, videos, and
 quizzes) and fieldwork (shadowing psychiatric nurses and CBR
 workers for children with disabilities). In the pre-trial pilot study,
 CBR workers each delivered CBR to one family for 6 months (Asher
 et al., 2018b). CBR workers were expected to work full-time for
 RISE and their salary was matched to that of local health extension
 workers.
 CBR visits lasted 30–90 min and took place at the participants’
 home. The intervention emphasised human rights, social inclusion
 and the possibility of recovery. Phase 1 lasted 2–3 months, during
 which time home visits were every 1–2 weeks. The focus was on
 engagement and addressing core needs through the modules
 ‘Understanding schizophrenia’, ‘Improving access to health ser-
 vices’, ‘Preparing for a crisis’ and ‘Dealing with human rights
 problems’. In Phase 2, lasting 5–6 months, home visits were every
 2 weeks. A subset from 11 optional modules were selected to
 support achievement of individual goals. Optional modules
 included ‘Improving physical health’, which included simple advice
 and problem-solving steps related to healthy eating, reducing alco-
 hol consumption and accessing physical healthcare. The ‘Dealing
 with stress and anger’ module included relaxation techniques and
 simple anger management approaches. The ‘Getting back to work’
 module covered preparation and problem solving for caregivers to
 support their relative, focusing on returning to farm work. Other
 optional modules covered adherence support, family intervention,
 support returning to social activities, and dealing with stigma. In
 Phase 3 (4 months), the emphasis was on preventing relapse and
 maintaining progress. CBR workers met with community members
 to mobilise resources for individual participants, for example,
 treatment costs or family mediation. At a sub-district level, CBR
 workers conducted additional community mobilisation (public
 awareness-raising meetings and engaging with community leaders)
 and ran family support groups. Two supervisors, who were not
 mental health specialists, oversaw the frequency, content and qual-
 ity of home visits. If the CBR workers identified suicide intent,
 relapse, physical illness or medication side-effects they referred
 participants to the health centre in addition to regular appoint-
 ments. CBR workers were referred to the trial psychiatric nurse if
 participants were unable to attend the health centre.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> • Depressive symptoms were measured using a version of the
 Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 has been
 demonstrated to have good construct (Cronbach’s alpha 0.87),
 concurrent and convergent validity in the study district
 (Habtamu et al., 2022).
 
<section> • Alcohol use disorder was assessed using a version of the Alcohol
 Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) adapted for the

 Ethiopian setting. An AUDIT score ≥ 8 indicates probable alco-
 hol use disorder (hazardous or harmful drinking). The AUDIT
 has been demonstrated to have good internal consistency in the
 study district (Cronbach’s alpha 0.84) (Zewdu et al., 2019)
 
<section> • Underweight was measured using body mass index (weight (kg)/
 (height, in m) 2 < 18.5.
 
<section> • Food insecurity was assessed using a single binary question on
 hunger due to lack of resources or food in last month.
 Data were collected by lay data collectors at baseline, 6 months
 (±10 weeks) and 12 months (±10 weeks) at the participant’s home
 or health centre. Sociodemographic information was collected at
 the PRIME cohort baseline or RISE baseline.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> Assuming 23% attrition, we aimed to recruit 182 participants to
 provide an endline sample size for the analysis of 140 participant
 dyads in 54 sub-districts. This sample size provides 85% power to
 detect a 20% absolute difference in the primary outcome, WHO-
 DAS score, between treatment arms with 5% significance, assuming
 a mean WHODAS score of 50 in the control arm, a k (coefficient of
 variation) of 014 and a within-cluster standard deviation (SD) of
 16. The study was not powered to detect effects in the exploratory
 outcomes reported in the current article. Baseline characteristics of
 participants and sub-districts were compared between treatment
 arms. Outcome analyses used intention-to-treat principles, analys-
 ing participants according to the arm to which they were rando-
 mised. Outcome measures were summarised at baseline, 6-month
 and 12-month data points by treatment arm. We conducted a
 repeated measures analysis combining 6 and 12 month outcome
 data. We also analysed the 6 and 12 month data separately as a
 sensitivity analysis. For binary outcomes, we reported intervention
 effects as minimally- and fully-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and
 95% CIs estimated from logistic random effect regression models.
 For continuous outcomes, we estimated intervention effects using
 linear mixed-effects regression and reported them as minimally-
 adjusted mean differences, fully-adjusted mean differences
 (FAMDs), and effect sizes defined as standardised mean differ-
 ences, with 95% CIs. Minimally adjusted models included baseline
 proxy-rated WHODAS total score, health centre (fixed effect) and
 sub-district (random effect). CBR worker was not adjusted for due
 to the high collinearity of CBR worker and health centre. Fully
 adjusted models included variables associated with missingness
 (threshold p < 01; presented previously; Asher et al., 2022), and
 variables deemed unbalanced between arms at baseline. The ana-
 lyses were complete case (i.e., we only included participants with
 data on the variables of interest). Process and adverse event data
 have been presented previously (Asher et al., 2022). Statistical
 analyses were done with Stata version 15. An independent Data
 Safety and Monitoring Board oversaw the study. The trial is regis-
 tered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02160249).
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Participants were enrolled between Sept 16, 2015 and Mar 11, 2016
 (Figure 1). Of the 54 available sub-districts, 27 were randomised to
 the intervention arm and 27 to the control arm. A total of 294 poten-
 tial participants were pre-screened, of whom 91 were excluded. A
 further 37 individuals were not enrolled. Of these, 22 participants
 (108%) did not meet the inclusion criteria, one participant and six
 caregivers declined (34%) and eight participants were excluded due
 to sufficient numbers in the cluster (39%). Three sub-districts were
 excluded at each of the pre-screening and enrolment stages. Hence
 of 54 potential sub-districts for inclusion, 48 were included.
 Twenty-four sub-districts (79 participants) were assigned to the
 intervention arm and 24 sub-districts (87 participants) were
 assigned to the control arm.
 Participants had a mean age of 314 years (range 18–80). At
 baseline, there were high levels of disability (mean proxy-rated
 WHODAS 515 [SD 236]) and unemployment (57.8%). Alcohol
 use disorder was detected in 20.0% of participants. Underweight
 and food insecurity were found in 34.6% and 15.1% of participants.
 We observed some imbalance in baseline participant characteristics
 by arm (Table 1). Control-arm participants were more likely than
 intervention arm participants to be female, to have lower household
 socio-economic status, to be unemployed, and to have social

<section> Discussion
 
<section> This article presents exploratory findings from the RISE trial,
 
<section> which is to the best of our knowledge the first randomised 
<section> controlled trial of any psychosocial intervention for people with
 schizophrenia in a low-income country setting. CBR was a com-
 plex intervention with a range of components including efforts to
 improve livelihoods and support to improve physical health.
 Depressive symptoms, alcohol use disorder, underweight and
 food insecurity, whilst they were not prioritised as main outcomes,
 were therefore worthy of the exploratory analysis presented in this
 article. Moreover, excess mortality is a key argument for the
 prioritisation of schizophrenia in global mental health efforts
 (Patel, 2015). In Ethiopia, reflecting global patterns (Ali et al.,
 2022), the risk of premature mortality amongst people with
 schizophrenia is more than double that of the general population
 over a 10 year follow-up period (Fekadu et al., 2015), with infec-
 tious diseases, suicide, accidents and severe malnutrition the most
 common causes of death (Teferra et al., 2011; Fekadu et al., 2015).
 Alcohol use disorder, depression, undernutrition and household
 food insecurity may arguably represent modifiable risk factors for
 premature mortality. We did not find any impact of CBR on any of
 these outcomes. These findings build on the main trial results
 which showed an impact on disability, symptoms and access to
 mental health care, along with high levels of intervention fidelity;
 and which in turn reflected the benefits of community-based
 psychosocial interventions found in middle-income country set-
 tings (Chatterjee et al., 2014; Asher et al., 2017b; Li et al., 2018; Luo
 et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020). As such, whilst the intended
 improvements in functioning materialised, these did not appear
 to be achieved through the hypothesised pathways of improved
 physical health and increased income delineated on the theory of
 change (Supplementary File 1). Future qualitative analyses, draw-
 ing on data from CBR participants and workers, will further
 interrogate the theory of change, including exploration of barriers
 and facilitators to the success of CBR and its mechanisms of
 impact.
 The prevalence of underweight in male RISE participants was
 greater than the general population in Ethiopia, confirming that
 malnutrition may be an area for need for this group (women: 22%
 in general population age 18–49 years vs. 22% in RISE; men: 33%
 general population age 18–49 years vs. 43% in RISE (ICF, 2016)).
 The PRIME cohort study, in which RISE was nested, demon-
 strated that in rural Ethiopia access to mental health care appears
 to reduce food insecurity amongst people with schizophrenia,
 through effects on work functioning (Tirfessa et al., 2020). We
 have previously reported the lack of benefits of CBR on work
 functioning and employment when delivered in addition to FBC
 (Asher et al., 2022), and this may explain the absence of effect on
 underweight and food insecurity found in the current analysis. It
 is likely that there are insufficient opportunities in this rural
 Ethiopian context to make meaningful changes to employment.
 The absence of a savings or microfinance component may also
 have limited the potential impact on food insecurity. Further-
 more, the RISE pilot study demonstrated that due to high poverty
 levels in the wider community, financial or material support for
 participants, mobilised by CBR workers, was usually precarious
 (Asher et al., 2018b). The moral and social support mobilised, for
 example in the form of family mediation, was typically more
 available and sustainable. There is also little evidence that the
 types of simple dietary advice and general physical health advice
 included in the RISE intervention are effective in improving
 outcomes for people with schizophrenia in any context (Tosh
 et al., 2014; Pearsall et al., 2016).
 There are indications that access to facility-based mental health
 care can lead to a reduction in the prevalence of alcohol use disorder
 amongst people with schizophrenia in Ethiopia. Depressive symp-
 toms also appear to reduce over time with access to care, though
 these may remit spontaneously (Hanlon et al., 2019). Again, our
 results show that CBR did not make any additional impacts on these
 outcomes. The RISE pilot study identified CBR’s power to foster a
 hopeful outlook and improve self-esteem as a common experience
 of CBR participants, and a potentially important pathway to
 improved functioning (Asher et al., 2018b). However, our measure
 of depressive symptoms, PHQ-9, is not designed to capture positive
 mental health states. Moreover, CBR did not incorporate evidence-
 based psychological interventions for depression and alcohol use
 disorder, for example, problem-solving therapy or motivational
 interviewing. Better understanding of the nature of depression
 amongst people with schizophrenia in rural Ethiopia, for example,
 whether it is best understood as an expression of negative symp-
 toms, related to anti-psychotic medication, or distress at social
 circumstances, would aid the interpretation of our results. How-
 ever, we did not collect data with the specific aim of interrogating
 these issues.
 An important limitation is that the study was not powered to
 detect impacts on these exploratory outcomes. Problems with data
 sparsity and missing BMI data also meant low numbers were
 included in regression models, making it more difficult to detect
 any effects. There were large amounts of missing data at 6 months.
 Further, there was no assessment of the long-term impact of CBR
 after intervention delivery was completed. Finally, a validated
 instrument such as the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale
 (Tirfessa et al., 2020) would have been a preferable measure of food
 insecurity, compared to the single item assessing hunger.
 On the basis of the main RISE trial results, we recommended
 psychosocial interventions such as CBR should be delivered as an
 adjunct to FBC, and avenues for the implementation of this (e.g., to
 consider a new cadre of mental health worker) were proposed
 (Asher et al., 2022). As we demonstrated an impact on functioning
 and other outcomes at 12 months, but not 6 months, we also
 proposed a minimum 12-month intervention is required. The
 findings presented in the current analysis do not change those
 fundamental recommendations, however, we should consider
 whether the intervention could be modified in their light. CBR is
 known to increase access to FBC (including medication adherence
 and attendance to clinic appointments), and this care in turn
 appears to improve depressive symptoms, alcohol use disorder
 and food insecurity (Hanlon et al., 2019). We suggest that facilitat-
 ing access to care, for example through adherence support, help to
 access free medication and appointment reminders, should be
 developed as a key focus of psychosocial interventions to ensure
 all people with schizophrenia experience these benefits. However,
 these approaches should be delivered in parallel to efforts to sup-
 port social inclusion and livelihoods.
 In many middle and high-income countries people living with
 severe mental illness are eligible for social protection payments,
 such as disability grants in South Africa (Wright, 2015). There is
 some evidence that livelihood interventions such as grants
 delivered through self-help groups might provide additional
 impacts on poverty when delivered alongside mental healthcare
 amongst people with schizophrenia (Lund et al., 2013). Such inter-
 ventions are under-researched but may be challenging to deliver in
 an affordable, sustainable and scalable way (de Menil et al., 2015).
 RISE did not include a formal livelihoods intervention such as
 microfinance due to, (i) worries raised in the intervention devel-
 opment phase that this approach could increase stress and result in
 the exploitation of participants (Asher et al., 2015), (ii) concerns

 that this would not meet the primary need to create an intervention
 that was scalable using limited resources, and (iii) limited project
 funds. The feasibility and effectiveness of such initiatives on out-
 comes for people with schizophrenia is a research and policy
 priority (Rose-Clarke et al., 2020). Future research could investi-
 gate the acceptability and impact of scalable models of livelihood
 support, for example, using savings groups, rather than microfi-
 nance schemes requiring external capital.
 Globally there is also a dearth of evidence and guidelines for the
 treatment of dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and alcohol use dis-
 order (Alsuhaibani et al., 2021). Whilst proposed psychosocial
 interventions for dual diagnosis include assertive community treat-
 ment, cognitive behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing,
 there is little evidence to support one over another (Hunt et al.,
 2019). Whilst there is also little evidence for how alcohol use disorder
 interventions, in general, can be successfully implemented in sub-
 Saharan Africa (Mushi et al., 2022), a pilot study of brief (one-
 session) intervention for alcohol use disorder delivered in primary
 care was found to be acceptable and feasible in community members
 in rural Ethiopia (Zewdu et al., 2022). Future research could explore
 the feasibility and impact of similar very brief interventions delivered
 to people with schizophrenia, either by CBR workers as an optional
 component, or through referral to primary care. Proposed
 community-level health promotion initiatives targeting harmful
 alcohol consumption (Zewdu et al., 2022) could also dovetail with
 the community mobilisation aspects of CBR.
 The most appropriate means to address the high levels of
 depressive symptoms amongst people with schizophrenia are not
 clear. Globally, the evidence for anti-depressants for people with
 schizophrenia remains equivocal (Gregory et al., 2017). Whilst
 brief and/or trans-diagnostic psychological interventions are
 effective in improving depression in the general population in
 LMIC when delivered by lay workers (Weobong et al., 2017;
 Hamdani et al., 2020), such approaches have not been applied to
 severe mental illness. Furthermore, lay workers already delivering
 a time-intensive, complex intervention such as CBR may not have
 the time capacity to deliver a psychological intervention. Simple
 problem-solving approaches were also the most challenging skills
 for CBR workers to acquire (Asher et al., 2021). Screening for
 suicidality may be a useful way to identify severe depression
 amongst people with schizophrenia in community settings, fol-
 lowed by referral to a primary health centre for anti-depressants
 and problem-solving therapy.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> We evaluated the impacts of CBR on a range of exploratory
 outcomes linked to physical and mental health in people with
 schizophrenia by conducting a high-quality cluster randomised
 controlled trial. CBR has previously been shown to improve func-
 tioning, symptom severity, and engagement with mental health-
 care, when provided as an adjunct to FBC. There was no evidence
 that CBR delivers additional impacts on depressive symptoms,
 alcohol use disorder, underweight or food insecurity in people
 with schizophrenia, over and above the beneficial impacts of
 accessing FBC. Psychosocial interventions in low-resource settings
 should strengthen efforts to support access to treatment amongst
 people with schizophrenia alongside social and livelihoods inter-
 ventions. Future research should explore how further impacts on
 depressive symptoms, alcohol use, malnutrition and poverty can
 be achieved.
