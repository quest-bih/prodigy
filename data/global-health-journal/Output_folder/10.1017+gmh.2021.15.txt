<section> mental health is linked to early childhood development, yet more
 interventions to prevent maternal depression and opti-
 of young children is needed. Objectives of this cluster-ran-
 (cRCT), based in Northern Ghana, are to assess the impact of the lay
 Integrated Mothers and Babies Course and Early Childhood
 program on (1) the mental health of mothers of children under
 development of their children.

 survey (∼19 months post-baseline). There were no significant effects

 in both arms (3%). Future research should examine the potential
 on postpartum mental health more broadly with varying content.
 and recent World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on
 development (ECD) clearly recognize the critical role of positive
 optimal ECD and recommend that interventions integrate support
 with early childhood health and development services (World
 al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2020). Maternal psychological
 and the postnatal period have been identified as a key risk factor
 outcomes in growth, cognition, school achievement, and overall
 middle-income countries (LMICs) (Rahman et al., 2004; Sawyer
 
<section> 2011; Albanese et al., 2019; Claessens et al., 2015). Likewise, there
 self-efficacy is affected by depression, and lower self-efficacy predicts
 and cognitive outcomes (Albanese et al., 2019).
 in the first years of life is positive, supportive, developmentally
 with parents and/or caregivers (Aboud and Yousafzai, 2015). There is
 that community-based interventions, delivered by trained com-
 have a significant impact on perinatal depression and/or child 
<section> development outcomes (Chowdhary et al., 2014; Singla et al.,
 2015). For example, in rural Uganda, a cluster-randomized con-
 trolled trial (cRCT) revealed that a community-based parenting
 intervention reduced maternal depressive symptoms and
 improved child development outcomes in cognition and receptive
 language outcomes compared to a control group (Singla et al.,
 2015). A systematic review of nine studies conducted in LMICs
 revealed that interventions delivered by non-professional health
 workers were effective in treating perinatal depression
 (Chowdhary et al., 2014).
 Ghana has endorsed and prioritized the Nurturing Care
 Framework for advancing ECD which includes a focus on paren-
 tal mental health to support responsive caregiving (UNICEF and
 Countdown to 2030, 2019). There is global and Ghana-specific
 evidence that maternal depression negatively affects parenting
 practices, including under-stimulation, and child health outcomes
 including socio-emotional health, yet the evidence base for real-
 world, scaled interventions applicable to rural populations is
 still limited (Wemakor and Mensah, 2016; Huang et al., 2018;
 Jeong et al., 2018; Madlala and Kassier, 2018).
 The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of a group-
 based, cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention for women deliv-
 ered during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The two pri-
 mary aims are to assess the impact of the Integrated Mothers
 and Babies Course and Early Childhood Development (iMBC/
 ECD) intervention on (1) the mental health of mothers of chil-
 dren under age 2 living in rural northern Ghana; and (2) the
 socio-emotional development of their children.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> The Integrated Mothers and Babies Course (iMBC) is an
 evidence-based intervention for preventing postpartum depres-
 sion that has been tested with low-income English- and
 Spanish-speaking pregnant women at high risk for depression
 in the USA and adapted for use in low-resource settings (Le
 et al., 2010, 2015; Le, 2018). The iMBC content is based on the
 principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy and attachment theory.
 The new iMBC/ECD curriculum was designed with the aim of
 supporting pregnant women and mothers with children under
 years of age to manage daily stressors effectively, promote early
 stimulation behaviors (ESB) and bonding to support child devel-
 opment, and decrease future risk of depression. The theoretical
 basis for iMBC is that improved mood coupled with ECD knowl-
 edge and skills acquired during group sessions will lead to greater
 parenting self-efficacy, positive parenting practices, and ultimately
 improved child development.
 In Ghana, the iMBC/ECD intervention was implemented in
 the context of the Rural Emergency Health Service and
 Transport (REST II) project led by Catholic Relief Services
 (CRS), an international, non-governmental organization working
 in Northern Ghana in collaboration with the Ghana Health
 Service (GHS). REST II combines both facility and community-
 based approaches across 10 districts to improve Maternal,
 Newborn, Child Health, and Nutrition (MNCHN) practices and
 pre/postnatal health service utilization. A key activity of REST II
 is Community Pregnancy Surveillance and Targeted Education
 Sessions (C-PrES). Routine C-PrES is delivered via educational
 group sessions that promote the adoption of key MNCHN beha-
 viors (e.g. newborn care, exclusive breastfeeding, etc.) among
 pregnant women and mothers of children under age 2 with con-
 tent endorsed by the GHS. C-PrES groups are composed of ∼20–
 25 women from the same community. iMBC/ECD was delivered
 via C-PrES groups and implemented by ‘model mothers’ who
 were women from the communities and supervised by GHS com-
 munity health officers and CRS REST II field staff. The model
 mothers were jointly identified by CRS and GHS staff as
 women who were pregnant or had a child under age 2 and who
 exhibited what they considered healthy MNCHN-related beha-
 viors. They were also supposed to be literate in the local language.
 The model mothers, alongside GHS staff nurses, received a
 1-week training in July 2018 and a 3-day refresher training in
 November 2018 on iMBC delivered by masters-level CRS staff
 who had themselves been trained by one of the iMBC original
 developers, a clinical psychologist based in the USA and a master
 iMBC trainer from Kenya. Weekly supervision by GHS nurses
 was also provided to the model mothers to review and practice
 content.
 iMBC/ECD was delivered during 14 group sessions (∼1 h)
 administered every 2 weeks over a 7-month period. Regular
 C-PrES groups met with the same frequency. The modules guided
 mothers to describe and manage their internal and external real-
 ities through the application of select coping skills. The iMBC
 curriculum also integrated key ECD messages (e.g. importance
 of antenatal care, breastfeeding and nutrition, seeking timely
 care for sick child). To support behavior change, home visits
 were conducted once a month to check on mothers’ mood, assess
 uptake of negotiated ECD behaviors, and encourage husbands
 and grandmothers to support mothers’ participation in the pro-
 ject. After the 14 sessions, mothers were invited to continue to
 receiving age-appropriate ECD integrated messages along with
 five additional iMBC booster sessions.
 The ECD content within both the integrated iMBC/ECD inter-
 vention and the C-PrES control groups aligned with early stimu-
 lation content appropriate during pregnancy and the first 2 years
 of a child’s life, namely play and communication activities as
 highlighted by UNICEF’s Care for Child Development (WHO
 and UNICEF, 2012).
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> This study is a longitudinal cRCT of 32 community-based
 women’s groups (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT03665246) to evaluate
 the impact of the iMBC/ECD intervention that was administered
 by CRS.
 The study collected data at four time points. Baseline data
 (August 2018) were collected when participants were pregnant
 and the timing was intended to be right before the beginning of
 the groups; however, there was about a 3-month delay between
 baseline data collection and the start of the program, so an add-
 itional ‘mini’ survey focused on mental health measures was
 added (December 2018) to ensure no dramatic differences in
 mental health status at baseline/pre-intervention. The first
 follow-up data collection period (follow-up 1) was immediate
 post-intervention (July 2019) and the second follow-up
 (follow-up 2) was 8-months post-intervention (February 2020).
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> We targeted recruitment of 16 clusters per arm (32 total clusters)
 assuming a standardized effect size on the primary outcomes of
 approximately half a standard deviation (i.e. 0.5), and an ICC 
<section> of 0.04 based on preliminary data from a similar study in
 Cameroon (NCT03195036). Assuming the possibility of one clus-
 ter dropping out, we had 91.6% power to detect this effect size at
 an α of 0.05, with an average of 10 total participants per group
 and a large coefficient of variation of cluster sizes of 0.850.
 After recruitment, we had 374 total participants across 32 clusters,
 with an average cluster size of 11.7 and a coefficient of variation of
 cluster sizes of 0.79.
 
<section> Randomization and masking
 
<section> We performed stratified, constrained randomization (Raab and
 Butcher, 2001). The randomization was stratified by district and con-
 strained by 2018 population estimates, distance to the nearest health
 facility, and type of health facility (see Table 2). Constrained random-
 ization was implemented using the cvcrand Stata package by the
 US-based team (Gallis et al., 2018). Both the intervention and control
 groups could have been identifiable to participants and/or the
 research assistants (RAs). The analysis team was not masked; how-
 ever, a statistical analysis plan was created prior to follow-up 2 data
 collection.
 
<section> Study participants and study setting
 
<section> All of the participant women were enrolled in the group-based
 C-PrES program, waiting for the program to begin. Each
 C-PrES group was randomized to receive one of two programs
 
<section> – the intervention groups were exposed to maternal mental health
 content with integrated ECD messages (iMBC/ECD) and the con-
 trol group was exposed to the usual basic maternal and child edu-
 cation messages (e.g. timely antenatal/postnatal care, nutrition/
 feeding, childhood illnesses, etc.). Therefore, the study had
 iMBC/ECD groups and 16 C-PrES only groups.
 To participate in this study conducted from August 2018 to
 February 2020, eligible participants had to be registered in a
 C-PrES group, 16 years or older, currently pregnant at baseline,
 and planning to maintain residence in the community for at
 least 6 months (duration of the program). The study was conducted
 in 32 communities (clusters) in two districts in Northern Ghana:
 West Mamprusi District in the North East Region where
 Mampruli is spoken, and Nabdam District in the Upper East
 Region where Nabt is spoken. Each community had one available
 women’s group in which all pregnant women in the community
 could enroll, resulting in 32 women’s groups across the study par-
 ticipants. Additional details on data collection procedures have
 been previously published (Lillie et al., 2020; Mackness et al., 2021).
 
<section> Data collectors
 
<section> Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected by a total of
 24 RAs who received 1 full week of training prior to every data
 collection time point (3 trainings), which included ethics,
 community-based pre-testing activities, orientation to tablet-based
 CommCare data collection, interviewing skills, and procedures for
 referrals as needed (e.g. mental health, domestic violence, child
 undernutrition). The RAs were literate in English, spoke the local
 languages and were recruited from the communities.
 
<section> Primary outcome measures
 
<section> For our primary maternal mental health measure, we used the
 Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a depression screener
 that has been previously validated and recommended for use in
 Ghana, though not in the Mampruli or Nabt languages
 (Kroenke et al., 2001; Kroenke and Spitzer, 2002; Weobong
 et al., 2009). The nine items of the PHQ-9 are summed for a
 score between 0 and 27. The PHQ-9 underwent a forward and
 back translation process for Mampruili and Nabt, with profes-
 sional translators overseeing a group consensus process to address
 any discrepancies before arriving at the final translations. The
 Cronbach’s α for the PHQ-9 was 0.82 at baseline, 0.88 at first
 follow-up and 0.84 at the last follow-up indicating good internal
 consistency.
 For our primary child socio-emotional development measure,
 we used the Ages and Stages Questionnaire Social Emotional
 
<section> (ASQ:SE-2) (Squires et al., 2015). The ASQ:SE-2 is a parent-
 reported survey with multiple age intervals of varying numbers
 of questions to identify young children at risk for social emotional
 difficulties including screens for self-regulation compliance, com-
 munication, adaptive functioning, autonomy, affect, and inter-
 action with people. This study used the 2-month (1–2 months
 30 days), 6-month (3–8 months 30 days), 12-month (9–14
 months 30 days), 18-month (15–20 months 30 days), and
 24-month (21–26 months 30 days) intervals. Parent response
 options were ‘often or always’, ‘sometimes’, or ‘rarely or never’
 to each question and then a yes or no question if the parent
 has a concern about the specified behavior. The higher the
 score, the higher the risk of social emotional difficulties. The
 ASQ:SE-2 was forward translated into Mampruli and Nabt and
 the RAs reviewed and revised the translations as a team during
 training. In order to compare study children across age ranges
 (at follow-up 2, three age interval ASQ:SE-2 forms were relevant),
 we took the average item score for each child at each time point
 
<section> (FAQ – Scoring ASQ:SE-2 [online] 2019). The Cronbach’s α for
 the ASQ:SE-2 at the last follow-up was 0.71 for the 6-month ver-
 sion, 0.68 for the 12-month version, and 0.65 for the 18-month
 version indicating adequate internal consistency.
 
<section> Covariates
 
<section> Socioeconomic status was assessed using the Ghana Equity Tool
 which uses data from the DHS to create a list of assets that may
 be important indicators of household wealth (Ghana Equity
 Tool [online] 2016). We added two additional questions about
 assets that the local data collection team in Ghana thought were
 important assets that may determine wealth (Does your house-
 hold have a satellite dish? Does anyone in your household use
 mobile money?). To make one single SES variable, we generated
 a previously devised asset index using the polychoric correlation
 principal component analysis approach to create five wealth quin-
 tiles based on the Ghana Equity Tool and the two additional
 questions listed above (Kolenikov and Angeles, 2009; Maselko
 et al., 2018). Those items in the equity tool that did not show
 much variability (>90% owned or did not own asset) were
 excluded from the creation of the asset index.
 The Household Hunger Scale (HHS) was used to assess food
 insecurity (Ballard et al., 2011). HHS is a six-question scale
 [three topical questions (no food in the house, hunger when
 going to sleep, lack of food in 24 h) which are each followed by
 questions asking the frequency of occurrence] which is summed
 to create a score from 0 to 6 with higher scores indicating higher
 levels of food insecurity. We used the standard categorical variable
 indicating little to no hunger (0–1 point), moderate to severe hun-
 ger (2–3 points), and severe hunger (4–6 points). 
<section> Maternal early stimulation behaviors (ESB) during pregnancy
 were assessed with four questions: during this pregnancy, how
 often do you talk softly to him/her and touch belly, sing songs
 to him/her, tell him/her about his/her family, and dance to
 music. Each ESB was scored never (0 points), rarely (1 point),
 sometimes (2 points), frequently (3 points). The maternal–fetal
 relationship, which focuses on interactions and feelings the
 expectant mother has toward her developing fetus, is one of the
 first opportunities in ECD to create a nurturing relationship
 between caregiver and baby and research has shown that touching
 and talking to the belly is widely recognized and measured as an
 indicator of maternal–fetal attachment (Cranley, 1981; Muller and
 Mercer, 1993). Only ESB during pregnancy was included in ana-
 lyses as this was needed for adjustments for balance imbalances.
 ESB at older ages are assumed at random across the treatment
 and control arms.
 Physical, sexual, and emotional intimate partner violence dur-
 ing the past 12 months were assessed using standard items from
 the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey only for those
 participants who had a partner in the past 12 months (Ghana
 Statistical Service et al., 2009). Domains were specified using
 the Guide to DHS Statistics (emotional IPV, physical IPV, sexual
 
<section> IPV) (Croft et al., 2018). For analysis, each domain was repre-
 sented using a binary variable indicating if the participant
 endorsed at least one item within the domain. Physical and sexual
 IPV were collapsed into one domain for analysis because these
 were the IPV domains that required a referral during data collec-
 tion for our study population.
 Additional questions included the woman’s age, relationship
 status, education, number of lifetime pregnancies, and self-
 reported physical health. For participants in the iMBC groups,
 there were also questions about their experience with the overall
 program and specific content.
 
<section> Data management and analyses
 
<section> Data were collected via the CommCare platform and were
 uploaded and synced with the main database and processed and
 analyzed using Stata/SE version 16.1 (StataCorp, College
 Station, TX, USA). Baseline characteristics of recruited mothers
 and cluster-level characteristics were reported by study arm.
 Continuous variables were summarized by means and standard
 deviations ( S D .), and categorical variables by counts and percen-
 tages. The primary analyses were designed as intent-to-treat. The
 primary mother outcome is PHQ-9 score at the 8-month post-
 intervention follow-up (follow-up 2) and the primary child out-
 come is the mean ASQ:SE-2 score at follow-up
 The two primary outcomes were analyzed using linear
 mixed-effects models so that all comparisons of interest could
 be estimated from the same model. All mixed models included
 C-PrES group as a random intercept to account for the clustered
 study design. In addition, we included a random intercept and a
 random slope for repeated measures at the follow-up time points
 for each participant for the primary endpoints. Restricted max-
 imum likelihood estimation was used in all models.
 In the primary statistical models, we adjusted for the four vari-
 ables upon which the randomization was stratified and con-
 strained: district, 2018 population estimates, distance to the
 nearest health facility, and health facility type (Table 2). In add-
 ition, we summarized baseline characteristics by intervention
 arm and by missing at follow-up. If we identified baseline vari-
 ables associated with loss-to-follow-up or imbalanced at baseline,
 we adjusted for these variables as sensitivity analyses. We consid-
 ered a variable to be imbalanced by loss to follow-up or by inter-
 vention arm if the corresponding p value is <0.10.
 For all outcomes, we additionally reported a p value comparing
 intervention and control using a clustered permutation test
 adjusted for the cluster-level variables on which the randomiza-
 tion was stratified and constrained, as is appropriate after con-
 strained randomization, using the cptest program in Stata/
 
<section> SE.16.1 (Gallis et al., 2018). In addition, we checked the robust-
 ness of the individual-level regressions using cluster-level analysis
 (Hayes and Moulton, 2017).
 Exploratory analyses were conducted to examine if the effect of
 the intervention on the primary outcomes differed by the level of
 potential effect modifiers listed in online Supplementary Figs S1–S4.
 Also, 72% of the participants (n = 136) in the intervention arm
 reported attending more than half or all of the sessions, excluding
 28 participants lost to follow-up and three participants with
 unknown attendance data. We performed separate ‘per-protocol’
 analyses on the primary outcomes, wherein we performed the
 same analyses as described above but included those in interven-
 tion who attended up to ‘about half’ of the sessions in the control
 group. Additional exploratory analysis examined the primary out-
 comes by baseline mental health status (none/mild and moderate/
 severe depression).
 Statistical analyses were conducted and reported according to
 the CONSORT guidelines (Fig. 1) and the CONSORT extension
 for Cluster Trials (Schulz et al., 2010; Campbell et al., 2012).
 
<section> Qualitative data collection and analysis
 
<section> To gain perspective on the implementation and acceptability of
 iMBC/ECD, 33 semi-structured interviews (SSIs) with key infor-
 mants and two focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted
 during the immediate post-intervention period in the iMBC
 communities only. SSIs were conducted with three district-level
 leaders, two CRS field officers, 10 GHS iMBC supervisors, nine
 model mothers, nine iMBC group participants, and two FGDs
 were conducted with 10 husbands of iMBC group participants.
 SSIs (∼45 min long) and FGDs (∼1 h long) were conducted in
 either Mampruli or Nabt as appropriate. SSI/FGD topic domains
 included key informant’s role in implementing and/or participat-
 ing in iMBC, what they liked or disliked about the program, chal-
 lenges and opportunities for future implementation/participation.
 Interviews were recorded and transcribed into English. Rapid
 content analysis was conducted using an analysis matrix in
 Microsoft Excel.
 
<section> Ethical approvals
 
<section> Ethical approval was received from the Duke University Campus
 IRB (# 2019-0020) and the Navrongo Health Research Center in
 Ghana (# NHRCIRB314). All participants (clinical trial cohort,
 individual interviews, and FGDs) signed a written informed con-
 sent form, or, if they were illiterate, were read the consent form
 and provided their fingerprint with a witness signature. Per best
 practices for conducting research on mental health and gender-
 based violence and GHS recommendations, all participants who
 endorsed suicidal ideation during the survey were offered a men-
 tal health referral and all participants who reported physical or
 sexual violence in the last 12 months were offered a referral for
 domestic violence social services. [Note: At baseline, we only
 documented if the referral was offered. For follow-up surveys, 
<insert> Fig. 1. CONSORT Diagram. 
<iend>

 we started documenting if referrals were accepted as participants
 had the right to decline the referral. Starting at the follow-up time
 points, we documented acceptance of mental health and IPV
 referrals. For mental health, 100% (27 of n = 27 at FUP 1) and
 
<section> 91% (10 of n = 11 at FUP 2) accepted a referral to psychiatric ser-
 vices. For IPV, 48% (19 of n = 40 at FUP1) and 26% (9 of n = 35 at
 FUP2) accepted a referral to social services.]
 
<section> Results
 
<section> There were 374 participants in the study at baseline, from
 C-PrES groups. Of these, 303 (81%), 313 (83.7%), and 266
 (71.1%) participants were followed up at the mini-survey, imme-
 diate post-intervention survey (follow-up 1), and the 8-month post-
 intervention survey (follow-up 2) time points, respectively (Fig. 1). 
<section> At baseline, the average age of the women was 27 years old, with
 almost half (49%) having never received formal education and
 39% of the women indicating that they experienced physical
 and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner in the past
 year. Further baseline individual characteristics including p values
 (unclustered) to check for baseline imbalance (defined as p value
 <0.10) are presented in Table 1 (Bolzern et al., 2019).
 The following variables, ESB four-item score during preg-
 nancy, PHQ-9 score, asset SES index, relationship status, and his-
 tory of physical/sexual/emotional violence, were all imbalanced
 
<section> ( p < 0.10) at baseline between intervention and control groups
 and thus necessitated sensitivity analyses (Table 1). In addition,
 variables were examined for differential missingness at each
 time point and the highest level of school attended was identified
 to differ by missing status at follow-up 2 (data not shown), which
 also required sensitivity analysis. A priori cluster-level characteris-
 tics of interest are summarized in Table 2.
 Regression results are presented in Table 3. There were no sig-
 nificant effects of the iMBC intervention on PHQ-9 and ASQ:
 SE-2 scores. However, the results favored the intervention arm
 in most cases. At baseline, the predicted average PHQ-9 score
 in the treatment arm was 6.8 (6.2, 7.4). In the control arm, the
 predicted average PHQ-9 score was 5.5 (4.9, 6.1). At 8-month
 post-intervention, we observed a slightly larger decrease in
 PHQ-9 score from baseline in the treatment arm than in the con-
 trol arm [estimate (95% CI) −0.8 (−1.9 to 0.3)]. There was no sig-
 nificant effect of intervention on the average ASQ:SE-2 mean
 score at 8-month post-intervention [estimate (95% CI) 0.02
 
<section> (−0.5 to 0.6)].
 Online Supplementary Table S1 displays the primary outcome
 variable summaries by treatment arm. Results of sensitivity ana-
 lyses (adjusting for baseline imbalances as noted in Table 1 and
 the differential loss to follow-up by education level) were similar
 to the estimated effects from the primary analyses. No significant
 effects were detected using cluster-level analysis and clustered per-
 mutation test. No significant effect modifiers were identified
 (online Supplementary Figs S1–S4).
 Per-protocol analyses for treatment exposure provided similar
 estimates of the treatment effect at the primary time point,
 follow-up 2 (online Supplementary Table S2: continuous regression
 results for PHQ-9 score and ASQ-SE by high attendance interven-
 tion group v. low attendance + control group). High attendance
 included those who reported attending all or more than half ses-
 sions (61.5%). Those who reported attending half, less than half
 the sessions, no sessions, or who were unsure of how many sessions
 they attended were grouped with the control participants for a ‘no
 exposure’ group (see online Supplementary Table S3 for attendance
 data). Exploratory analyses examining changes in depression
 among only those who had moderate or severe symptoms of depres-
 sion at baseline also revealed no difference between groups over
 time.
 Among participants in the intervention arm (iMBC/ECD
 groups), 93% reported being ‘very much’ or ‘extremely’ satisfied
 with the program, and 99% said they would recommend the pro-
 gram to a friend. Intervention participants were generally positive
 about the program indicating they highly valued some program
 components such as how to change their moods and thoughts,
 how to better communicate with the people in their lives (fam-
 ilies, husband, mother-in-law), and how to care for their baby.
 Qualitative SSI data from iMBC participants and implementers
 were also largely positive of the program overall, with comments
 that women were able to participate in the program due to
 familial support and that refreshments could help with attend-
 ance. Participants recalled key messages from both iMBC and
 ECD content (e.g. pleasant activities to improve mood and exclu-
 sive breastfeeding) but also indicated that some iMBC content was
 challenging such as ‘thought interruption’ and having scheduled
 ‘worry time’.
 Focus groups with husbands/partners revealed they were
 broadly supportive and interested in engaging in similar program-
 ming for themselves, noting that the biggest parental stressor was
 lack of money for food, health services, and education. They also
 highlighted learning from their partners how parental good
 moods affect child outcomes and women sharing what makes
 them happy/sad helps with partner communication.
 Qualitative data from government stakeholders and program
 implementers revealed high levels of support for the continuation
 of the iMBC/ECD program but also implementation challenges
 related to the literacy of Model Mothers (difficulty delivering con-
 tent), interpretation of course content into local languages, and
 attendance of participants. Illustrative quotes from the qualitative
 data can be found in online Supplementary Table S4.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> In this trial, we found no difference between the iMBC groups
 (maternal mental health/ECD intervention) and the ECD only
 controls over time on the main outcome variables (maternal
 depression and child social-emotional development). Our study
 revealed that a substantial portion of participants across both
 groups were experiencing moderate to severe symptoms of
 depression (PHQ-9 ⩾ 10) particularly during pregnancy (19.8%,
 n = 74), but less so during the early postpartum period (4.79%,
 follow-up 1, n = 15) and the extended postpartum period
 
<section> (3.01%, follow-up 2, n = 8).
 However, our results make several important contributions to
 the evaluation literature on addressing the socio-emotional devel-
 opment of young children in tandem with maternal mental health
 as a global strategy for ensuring children reach their full potential
 and caregivers have the internal resources they need to care for
 their families (World Health Organization, 2020). First, while
 depression symptoms decreased over time in both study arms,
 the prevalence of perinatal depression more broadly reaffirmed
 the critical need to address caregiver mental health as part
 of the responsive caregiving domain of Nurturing Care, particu-
 larly during pregnancy. The lack of measurable iMBC impact
 on maternal depression could be a reflection of the overall positive
 impact of having women’s groups more broadly. For example, in
 the group-based parenting intervention in Uganda, women in the
 intervention group had significantly fewer depressive symptoms
 over time compared to those in the control groups that did not
 attend a group-based intervention, even though the intervention
 groups did not have specific mental health content. While our
 control C-PrES groups with ECD content did not have a targeted
 psychological program component, by virtue of meeting, socializ-
 ing, and supporting each other, the control groups could have had
 their own positive impact on postpartum mental health.
 Determining the broader mental health impact of attending
 socially-oriented women’s groups, irrespective of content focused
 on psychological processes such as cognitive-behavioral therapy
 like our iMBC intervention, is worth further examination. If simi-
 lar maternal mental health and child development benefits can be
 found via a more generic social support women’s group, there are
 implications for the resources needed to implement each. The

 psychosocial benefits of women’s groups are increasingly of inter-
 est to the research community (Chomat et al., 2019; Preston et al.,
 2019).
 Regarding the null findings on the children’s socio-emotional
 development, there are a few areas of possible explanation and/or
 further inquiry. First, there could have been measurement issues
 for the ASQ: SE-2 which is designed for screening, not longitu-
 dinal assessments, and because this was used in a new context
 and there may have been issues of cultural applicability, standard
 cut-off scores would not be appropriate. Alternatively, the socio-
 emotional development of children under age 2 in this population
 may tend to be good such that there is minimal room for
 improvement. The mean item score can range from 0 to 10,
 with higher being worse, and our sample had a mean of about
 2.5–3.0. Finally, the intervention may have had an effect on
 early stimulation and responsive caregiving behaviors by mothers
 but the effects on child development were not yet realized given
 the length of the study.
 The implementation challenges for this cognitive-behavioral
 therapy group-based intervention are noteworthy. This interven-
 tion design, in consultation with the GHS, utilized peer mothers
 with low literacy in the local language and no formal health-care
 role to deliver the intervention as has been seen in other
 community-based mental health trials (Singla et al., 2017;
 Verhey et al., 2020). This strategy supported the potential sustain-
 ability of the intervention but came with literacy challenges for
 delivering the iMBC content with full fidelity. On a monitoring
 trip, the training facilitators noted that the illiteracy among
 about three-quarters of the lead mothers meant that in practice,
 these lay providers were relying significantly on memory to
 deliver content. Even though the curriculum materials were a
 combination of written and picture-based messages, it was still
 not sufficient to convey and help facilitators remember key com-
 ponents such as reality management and ensuring that partici-
 pants’ experiences were linked with course material explicitly.
 The other real-world implementation challenge for this trial
 was that the intervention was not intended solely as a treatment
 for mental disorders. Participant eligibility was not based on
 some pre-defined threshold for mental ill health. CRS as the
 implementing NGO in close collaboration with the GHS deter-
 mined that an important purpose of the iMBC intervention was
 to prevent the onset or further exacerbation of postpartum
 depression and anxiety and to build skills among women to man-
 age their mental well-being. Our power analysis took this into
 consideration but as the global mental health field purports to
 support a prevention-focused strategy, our research tools are
 still largely based on treating conditions, thus we could be missing
 important foundational skills building with these community-
 delivered mental health interventions that could have a realized
 impact beyond the life of the study.
 
<section> Strengths and limitations
 
<section> This study has a number of strengths and limitations. Data were
 only collected in two rural districts in northern Ghana and there-
 fore may not be generalized to the general population in Ghana.
 In addition, while the maternal and child health program from
 which we sampled was offered to all pregnant women in the
 study communities, we do not know if we captured the most vul-
 nerable women who did not have the time or resources to partici-
 pate in the program or in the study. For the child outcomes, we
 focused on the socio-emotional measure, although we know
 there are other important development domains not reflected in
 this analysis. Based on qualitative feedback from stakeholders
 involved in delivering the program, we know that there were dif-
 ficulties training and supporting the model mothers to deliver the
 iMBC content due to literacy issues which means intervention
 participants may not have received full exposure to the program
 regardless of attendance issues. Finally, we do not have a true,
 unexposed control group thus we cannot tease apart the general
 group effect regardless of educational content delivered in the
 groups. However, the study strength is the extent of data collection
 across 32 randomized communities and two local languages that
 lends important data for community-based programming in
 Northern Ghana with populations of similar socio-demographic
 characteristics.
 
<section> Implications for research and practice
 
<section> This intervention did not target women with mental health pro-
 blems but rather was deployed as a community-based strategy for
 preventing or reducing depression symptoms among the perinatal
 population in these rural areas. By virtue of our research-related
 referrals for mental health care and support to address gender-
 based violence, we know that participants were open to receiving
 referrals for more mental health care within the health system
 although we do not know the rates of follow-up or experiences
 with the available care in the public sector. Women were less will-
 ing to accept our social service referrals for gender-based violence
 which we know is highly correlated with mental health; however,
 a number of women did accept the referrals indicating a willing-
 ness to engage with formal services (Fisher et al., 2012; Laurenzi
 et al., 2020).
 Our previous baseline findings from this cohort indicated that
 poor mental health among our participants was correlated with
 household hunger, intimate partner violence, and insufficient
 support from female relatives (Lillie et al., 2020). It could be
 that an integrated maternal mental health and ECD intervention
 will not reach its intended impact if it does not also directly
 address these contributing factors to mental ill health. There are

 increasing calls for the fields of maternal and child health and
 mental health to take a syndemic approach to programming
 and more directly address these correlates and pre-disposing fac-
 tors (Laurenzi et al., 2020).
 Finally, research should continue to prioritize investigating the
 effectiveness of community-delivered interventions that address
 parental mental health and ECD. While lay counselor-delivered
 mental health interventions are now being prioritized within
 many low-resource contexts, it is not uncommon that rigorous
 programs and evaluations are also finding null results when the
 programs are scaled, indicating a continued knowledge gap for
 informing countries on effective affordable programming options
 (Austin et al., 2008; Sikander et al., 2019). The CRS Ghana team is
 already exploring ways to train and deliver the iMBC content with
 a fully pictorially-based iMBC curriculum for peer mothers and
 even more involvement from husbands/partners in an effort to
 optimize fidelity. There are new evidence-based resources for
 ensuring therapeutic competency among non-specialist, lay men-
 tal health providers that also could be utilized (Kohrt et al., 2015).
 Efforts to identify effective programming in support of parental
 mental health and responsive caregiving are critical as these are
 modifiable pathways that could mitigate suboptimal child devel-
 opment and ensure all children thrive. As the evidence base for
 targeted ECD interventions grows, we need more real-world eva-
 luations of community-based, lay counselor-led ECD and mater-
 nal mental health programs that are embedded in local resources
 and health and social services systems.
