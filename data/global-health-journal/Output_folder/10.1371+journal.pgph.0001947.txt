<section> Abstract
 
<section> Uncertainties about the efficacy of influenza vaccination for populations with heart failure
 (HF) in preventing cardiovascular outcomes, as well as lack of effective vaccination strate-
 gies, may contribute to low vaccine coverage rate (VCR) in China and globally. We
 assessed the feasibility of a strategy to promote influenza vaccines in patients hospitalized
 with acute HF in China and to inform the design of a hybrid effectiveness-implementation
 cluster randomized trial to evaluate this strategy on mortality and hospital re-admission. We
 conducted a cluster randomized pilot trial involving 11 hospitals in Henan Province in China,
 with mixed-methods evaluation between December 2020 and April 2021. A process evalua-
 tion involved interviews with 51 key informants (patients, health professionals, policy mak-
 ers). The intervention included education about influenza vaccination and availability of free
 vaccines administered prior to hospital discharge for HF patients, while usual care included
 attending community-based points of vaccination (PoV) for screening and vaccination.
 Implementation outcomes focused on reach, fidelity, adoption, and acceptability. Recruit-
 ment rates were assessed for trial feasibility. Effectiveness outcomes were influenza VCR,
 HF-specific rehospitalizations and mortality at 90 days. A total of 518 HF patients were
 recruited from 7 intervention and 4 usual care hospitals (mean of 45 participants per hospital
 per month). VCR was 89.9% (311/346, 86.1–92.8%) in the intervention group and 0.6% (1/
 172, 0.0–3.7%) in the control group. The process evaluation demonstrated reach to patients
 with lower socioeconomic and education status. There was good fidelity of the intervention
 components, with education and PoV set up processes being adapted to local hospital work-
 flow and workforce capacity. Intervention was acceptable and adopted by patients and
 health professionals. However, outside of a trial setting, concerns were raised around vacci-
 nation reimbursement costs, workforce accountability and capacity. The intervention

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Global guideline recommendations for the use of annual influenza vaccination in the elderly
 and among high-risk patients is particularly pertinent to patients with heart failure (HF),
 where disease progression is often exacerbated by respiratory infections [1–3]. However, influ-
 enza vaccine coverage rates (VCR) in people with HF vary widely across the globe, [4] and are
 particularly low (~0.6%) in China. Potential reasons include low awareness of influenza vacci-
 nation, uncertainty about benefits, limited access to vaccines, and relatively high out-of-pocket
 costs (80 to 200 Chinese Yuan [USD 13–31]) [4–6]. Influenza vaccination is available for peo-
 ple at Point of Vaccination (PoV) located in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
 (CDCs) or in community health centers in China [7]. Influenza vaccination is only free of
 charge in several cities in China, and rarely in smaller administrative jurisdictions such as
 counties, for older adults (age � 60 years); [8] making vaccination access a barrier since county
 hospitals cater to 75% of the Chinese population [9, 10].
 Given there is uncertainty about the efficacy of influenza vaccination in preventing mortal-
 ity and readmission among HF patients, and the effectiveness of strategies to improve influ-
 enza vaccine coverage in this patient population in China, policy- and practice-relevant
 evidence are required. Prior to initiating a large-scale hybrid effectiveness-implementation
 trial, we sought to assess the feasibility of a complex intervention aiming to influence patient,
 provider and system level behaviors. Specifically, in a multicenter pilot study, we aimed to 1)
 to assess recruitment feasibility; 2) estimate parameters to inform the sample size calculation
 for a large-scale trial; and 3) to understand the feasibility, acceptability, barriers and facilitators
 of this complex intervention to inform any modifications prior to the large-scale trial.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Ethics statement
 
<section> The pilot trial was approved by Medical Ethics Committee of Beijing Anzhen Hospital Affili-
 ated to Capital Medical University (approval number of ks2020017) and the Human Genetics
 Resources Administrative Office of the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (approval
 number 2020, GH3553). The process evaluation was approved by Medical Ethics Committee
 of Beijing Anzhen Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University (approval number
 2020096X) and by Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of New South Wales
 (approval number HC200988).
 
<section> Design
 
<section> We did a convergent mixed methods study that included a pilot cluster randomized trial and
 an embedded process evaluation [11, 12] The two-arm, parallel, hospital-based, pilot cluster
 randomized trial compared an intervention package for improving influenza vaccine uptake
 current usual care. County-level hospitals were eligible if they treated an average of >35 HF
 patients per month during the planned recruitment months in previous years, had clinical staff 
<section> available to be involved, were able to adhere to the study protocol, and were likely to be able
 follow-up participants in the community. Eligible participants were patients hospitalized with
 HF severity defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification grades III-IV at
 time of admission between December 2020 and January 2021. Patients with a known allergy
 vaccine components or who were pregnant were excluded. Patients were followed up at
 1-month and 3-months post-discharge. The process evaluation was a qualitative study involv-
 ing key informant interviews with relevant stakeholders and was informed by the UK Medical
 Research Council (MRC) process evaluation framework for complex interventions [13].
 
<section> Randomization
 
<section> The unit of randomization was the hospital. Eleven hospitals were assigned in a ratio of 2:1 by
 computer-generated random numbers (7 intervention and 4 control). More sites were
 assigned to the intervention arm to maximise variation of contexts in which intervention
 implementation could be observed.
 
<section> Recruitment
 
<section> Consecutive patients diagnosed with heart failure by their treating physicians were screened
 against the study eligibility criteria. The diagnosis of HF was based on typical symptoms and
 signs according to the 2016 European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines [14]. This clinical
 diagnosis was validated in each case by a trained cardiologist based on record review and clini-
 cal judgement. A prior history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, or stroke was cap-
 tured by patient self-report, based on knowledge of these conditions, year of diagnosis and
 relevant treatments. While rehospitalizations were captured during follow-up, recurrent hospi-
 talizations of the same patient due to HF during the recruitment period were not included.
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> The intervention package (Fig 1 and S1 Text) included (i) education of the health care team
 and patients; (ii) establishment of an immunization service within the hospital; and (iii) provi-
 sion of free influenza vaccine on the day of hospital discharge. Hospitals randomized to the
 control group continued usual care, which generally would be advice at discharge to attend a
 community based PoV service, where they would have incurred out-of-pocket expenditure for
 the influenza vaccine.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> Implementation outcomes focused on reach, fidelity, adoption, and acceptability. Recruitment
 rates were assessed for trial feasibility. The primary quantitative outcome was influenza vaccine
 coverage. Secondary outcomes were influenza like illness (ILI) and the composite of death or
 HF-specific hospital readmission for heart failure at 3-months follow up. ILI was defined as
 acute respiratory illness with a measured temperature of � 38˚C and cough, at any time during
 hospitalization [15]. Survival status at discharge and at 3-months follow-up was collected, with
 details of post-discharge events obtained through face-to-face or telephone interviews with the
 patient or next-of-kin. Data was collected on recruitment rate (number of participants
 recruited per month), and loss to follow-up at a hospital level.
 Vaccination status was recorded by site investigator and checked against immunization his-
 tory registry and receipt from health facilities providing vaccination service. Clinical outcomes
 reported by patients during follow up were verified by site investigator based on electronic
 medical records.

<section> in the intervention strategy and routine care.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> Descriptive analysis included VCR (percentage), recruitment rate (consented participants per
 month), ILI rate (percentage), and 3-month death or HF readmission rate (percentage). To
 assess the associations between a series of outcomes and the randomized group we have fitted
 the following: logistic regression for influenza vaccination status, Poisson model for ILI and
 death or HF-specific hospital readmission and Proportional-Hazards Cox regression with
 shared frailty for time to death or HF-specific readmission. All models were hierarchical at
 patient level with hospital as random-effects to take account of the cluster effect. Covariates
 included in the models were age, sex, education level, insurance type, history of coronary heart
 disease, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, ejection fraction category, brain natri-
 uretic peptide level, and pharmaceutical treatment. Binary outcomes are reported as propor-
 tions with 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated using the Wilson Score method with
 continuity correction. Intra-class correlation (ICC) for the outcome of death or HF-specific
 readmission at 3-months post-discharge was estimated to inform the sample size calculation
 for the planned subsequent large-scale trial. All statistical analyses were undertaken using R
 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, https://www.R-project.org/).
 
<section> Process evaluation
 
<section> The process evaluation was informed by the UK MRC process evaluation guidance [13] frame-
 work which supports a systematic examination of the relationships between contextual factors,
 intervention, implementation fidelity, intervention’s mechanism of impact, and outcome. [13]
 The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) was used in reporting
 the process evaluation [16]. 
<section> Interview guides were developed by three primary researchers RL, HL, and AP, based on the
 process evaluation framework and included questions about health system context, acceptability
 of the intervention and barriers and facilitators to its implementation (see 
<section> S2 and S3 Texts).
 
<section> The interview guides were piloted with two participants, with edits made to enhance clarity.
 Maximum purposive sampling was used across key characteristics which included intervention
 and control sites, how well the intervention was implemented (for intervention sites), whether the
 site was in a county location that was above or below gross domestic product (GDP) per capita
 a proxy for the socioeconomic characteristic of the geographic area), and type of stakeholder
 (patients and health professionals). Both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients were sampled.
 Health professionals were recruited with the assistance of site principal investigators and other
 investigators. All invited participants agreed to an interview and provided informed consent.
 
<section> Team reflexivity: RL and ZW have backgrounds in public health and clinical medicine, and
 conducted the interviews. Patient and health professional participants across all centers were
 recruited by YZ, a clinical research coordinator who knew some but not all the participants
 prior to the interviews, and introduced RL and ZW to interviewees before interview.
 Face to face interviews for health professionals took place at interviewees’ workplaces.
 Patients were invited to a hospital office and a family member was often present during inter-
 views involving older patients. Interviews were conducted either video or telephone call for
 participants who could not attend in person. All interviews were audio recorded except for
 one interviewee who only agreed to a written record of the interview. Interviews, each of
 which lasted about 30 minutes, were conducted from March 8th, 2021 to April 22nd, 2021.
 
<section> Analysis of the qualitative data
 
<section> Deductive coding was applied by the team to the interview transcripts to generate a set of key
 themes based on the MRC framework, followed by inductive coding to add new codes [17].
 Initially, three interviews (a healthcare provider, a public health professional, and a patient)
 were independently coded by RL, YF, HZ, YY. The team discussed their codes and generated
 coding framework for the remaining interviews. Transcription and analyses were done in Chi-
 nese, and the coding framework was translated to English. Selected illustrative quotes were
 translated to English and back translated to Chinese to check for accuracy by bilingual
 researchers. Description of the coding tree is provided in the Supporting Information. Nvivo
 12 (QSR International Pty Ltd. 2020) was used for data management and analysis.
 Themes from the qualitative study were triangulated with the quantitative pilot trial data
 understand fidelity of the intervention components, and the mechanisms of the acceptability
 and adoption of the intervention contributing to the trial outcomes [18].
 
<section> Reporting guidelines
 
<section> This study reporting follows the standard protocol items of the Recommendations for Inter-
 ventional Trials (SPIRIT), Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) state-
 ments, and Template for Intervention description and Replication (TIDieR) [19–21]. This
 pilot trial is registered at ChiCTR.org.cn (ChiCTR2000039081) and the acronym is PANDA
 Pilot (Population Assessment of Influenza and Disease Activity).

<section> hospital per day, range 0.6–1.8). A mean of 47 patients (range 22–61) were recruited per hospi-
 tal. (Fig 2). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of participants: median age of 72.8 years,
 52.7% were male, 71% had a primary school or lower level of education, and 82.6% were cov-
 ered by a rural cooperative medical insurance plan. Overall, the median length of hospitaliza-
 tion was 9 days.
 All hospitals in the intervention arm were able to establish local PoVs, even within cardiol-
 ogy wards, which included obtaining a permit from CDC, management of influenza vaccine
 stock and cold chain, and training existing nurses to immunize, over a two-to-four-week
 period.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> VCR in the intervention group was 89.9% (311/346), compared to 0.6% (1/172) in control
 sites.
 
<section> Table 2 provides details of clinical outcomes. At 3-month post-discharge, follow-up data
 for 498 patients (96.1%) were available.
 During hospitalization, 19 patients (3.7%) reported having an ILI. At 3-month follow-up,
 death or HF readmission occurred in 25.3% (131/518) participants, which includes 7.1% of
 participants who died and 19.1% of participants who were re-hospitalized. There were no sig-
 nificant differences in any clinical outcome between randomized groups (S1 
<section> Table).

 text, mechanisms of the acceptability and adoption, resulting in the outcomes of the pilot trial
 are summarized in

<section> Reach and recruitment. Baseline characteristics of pilot participants are broadly similar
 to those of participants from a recent large prospective HF registry designed to represent
 patients within the same province of China [22], except for lower education level and greater
 rural health insurance plan coverage in the current study, which purposefully focused exclu-
 sively on county-level hospitals. It was also noted that recruitment was challenging due to the

<section> COVID-19 pandemic, with less patients presenting to hospital due to higher admission criteria
 than usual for less urgent patients, longer admission screening time including COVID-
 19-related tests, and doctors being seconded as surge staff to provide COVID-19-related ser-
 vices outside cardiology wards. Nevertheless, it was still feasible to recruit enough patients for
 pilot study.
 
<section> Fidelity and local adaptation of the intervention components. Education. Educational
 workshops were delivered to both control and intervention sites according to protocol. How-
 ever, there was limited use of the patient educational materials on influenza vaccines and heart
 failure, as these were not distributed to the patients, by most of the site investigators. Instead,
 to streamline it with their clinical work, they verbally informed patients about importance of
 influenza vaccination upon admission, during the consent process, and at the time of
 discharge.
 
<section> Point of vaccination to be set up within the hospital. The vaccination of participants was
 undertaken in different formats, with adaptation to local health system context: in-house
 
<section> (in italics) as compared against our hypothesized contextual assumptions and causal mechanism (in non-
 of PANDA II pilot cluster randomized trial. 
<section> public health unit delivery of vaccines at the bedside in cardiology wards, cardiology nurses
 vaccinating patients at the bedside, and patients being transferred to PoV in another location
 in the hospital.
 
<section> Provision of free vaccination. Free influenza vaccination at discharge was offered to all eligi-
 ble participants, and was administered to 89.9% of participants in the intervention arm. About
 10% of participants in the intervention arm refused to be vaccinated mainly due to perceived
 uncertain interactions between vaccination and scheduled interventional medical treatments
 in addition to pharmacological therapeutics, concerns over vaccine safety, family advice, or
 perceived benefit.
 
<section> Mechanisms affecting the acceptability and adoption of intervention components.
 
<section> Education successfully increased the awareness of the benefits for influenza vaccination among
 providers and patients. Education regarding influenza vaccine, cardiovascular disease outcome,
 HF risk factors, and the value of disease prevention, were provided to patients and health care
 providers in both intervention and control arms. Routine care in county level hospitals rarely
 includes education on influenza vaccination for HF patients, as discharge plans mainly com-
 prised of information on HF triggers such as respiratory infection, excessive salt intake, and
 other noncardiac causes, but did not cover the importance of influenza vaccination. Only a
 few patient interviewees were aware of the association between influenza and cardiac health,
 or about how and where to access influenza vaccination, before the study intervention. One
 patient from the intervention site said, ‘I think it is useless to get influenza vaccine. I don’t
 always get cold during winter, so it is the same for me no matter I get influenza vaccination or
 not.’ In comparison, doctors and patients in the intervention arm reported a deeper under-
 standing of the potential benefits of the influenza vaccine after prescribing it to the patients or
 receiving it themselves and greater confidence in their HF management. A doctor from an
 intervention hospital said, ‘Being a clinical doctor and treating patients every day, I sometimes
 found myself lacking the knowledge of disease prevention and control. I had no idea that there
 were vaccines until I heard about it from CDC staffs and education workshops.’
 However, health professionals from CDC offices expressed concern about the potential for
 adverse events following the immunization of patients with chronic disease, and were unsure
 about the optimal timing of the influenza vaccine and wanted more advice from patients’ treat-
 ing physicians. Similarly, the immunization nurses described being uncomfortable in deter-
 mining the eligibility of the heart failure patients for influenza vaccines, and wanted greater
 guidance from the treating clinicians.
 Both patients and health professionals highlighted how the quality of the doctor-patient
 therapeutic relationship was key as patients who trusted their doctors were more likely to
 agree to the influenza vaccine, and that including family and extended family members was
 important in the patient’s decision making. Few hospitals incorporate routine follow-up clinic
 visits to manage HF patients, which were incorporated within the intervention strategy as a
 means to collect clinical outcomes and further turned out to be acceptable by strengthening
 doctor-patient therapeutic relationship.
 
<section> Free influenza vaccine welcomed but concerns about sustainability. Health professionals,
 patients, and policy makers generally welcomed the opportunity for free influenza vaccination.
 However, outside a trial setting, policy makers described that subsidizing free influenza vacci-
 nation of patients with chronic diseases was not a priority for the allocation of limited
 resources, as compared to pharmaceutical treatment, because of perceived greater importance
 of treatment over prevention and uncertain efficacy of influenza vaccines. Many health provid-
 ers and patients indicated the need for the cost of vaccinations, to be kept low in areas with
 limited resources, to overcome initial hesitancy towards vaccine due to out of pocket costs,
 and to enable the county hospitals to feasibly incorporate influenza vaccination into their 
<section> routine care. Health commission staff described how the economic development status of the
 county affected the ability of public insurance schemes to fund vaccination programs. It was
 noted that more affluent patients are more likely to self-purchase influenza vaccines each year
 to prevent exacerbation of chronic diseases. Health commission staff recommended the need
 for public medical insurance to cover vaccines to improve awareness and further vaccine cov-
 erage in patients and carers.
 A health commission staff from a control county said, ‘For most people, a hundred RMB is
 large cost. They have a lot to bear. If those in authority could provide financial assistance or med-
 ical insurance support, the work would be easily achieved.’
 Setting up a point of vaccination within the hospital was valued and facilitated bridging pre-
 ventive and clinical care. CDC officers and hospital managers valued the convenience of vacci-
 nating patients around the time of hospital discharge, and perceived that PoVs have the
 potential to benefit other at-risk chronic disease patient groups beyond HF patients after acute
 treatment. Hospital leadership championed the establishment of an in-hospital PoV service
 and associated resources. Most health providers described increasing health literacy as a high
 priority, particularly in rural areas where there is poor adherence to disease management plans
 and delayed presentation for acute events in the context of low education and knowledge. This
 study set an example for them to plan and utilize preventive care services in clinical settings,
 a hospital manager from intervention site put ‘as a result of national fundamental policies, (the
 hospital) now prioritize prevention and combines prevention with treatment. This (current pilot
 study) is a great project that we can easily embrace.’ However, providers highlighted that adding
 preventive care to the heavy workload of clinicians might not be sustainable beyond the pilot
 study. Some doctors expressed concerns over accountability of the vaccination and suggested
 assigning specialized staff if it was to become routine care.
 A doctor from an intervention hospital reinforced how the project facilitated inter-depart-
 ment collaboration. ‘Our cardiology department chair and the head of the hospital immuniza-
 tion service department consult with each other in terms of vaccination for patients.’
 
<section> Influenza vaccination in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic
 
<section> In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the PoVs setup were leveraging off the
 existing COVID-19 vaccination spots. Temporary PoVs were set up to respond COVID-19
 pandemic, either in a public health unit or in immunization tent in the open areas in hospitals
 (such as gardens or small parks between hospital buildings). These temporary PoVs were
 already certified by local CDC for COVID-19 vaccination, therefore administratively adding
 the influenza vaccination to the existing COVID-19 vaccination certification was easier than
 starting from scratch setting up a brand new PoV.
 A nurse from an intervention hospital said, ‘Then, through this program, explain to the
 patient. He/she (patient) would understand after the explanation that the vaccine could not be
 taken whenever you wished (supply constraints and during flu season). The patient showed that
 he/she was aware of the situation and that he/she was pleased to be vaccinated.’.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> The pilot study showed that timely recruitment of participants for a well-powered clinical out-
 comes trial is feasible. The implementation of the trial intervention is largely feasible with
 some adaptations relating to establishing a PoV. Using data from this pilot study, we propose
 large-scale hybrid efficacy-effectiveness cluster randomized trial involving 24 ~158 hospitals
 each arm and a mean of 50 patients per hospital to detect a 7% ~ 18% relative risk reduction
 1-year mortality and readmission in intervention group participants compared to those in 
<section> control group over three influenza seasons (trial registration number: ChiCTR2100053264).
 The main trial will contribute to a growing body of efficacy data in diverse populations, as well
 as contribute data on the effectiveness of an implementation strategy in a specific setting, in
 addition to recent efficacy findings of preventing cardiovascular outcomes from meta-analysis
 of RCTs and observational study [23, 24]. Moreover, the main trial will provide more informa-
 tion on vaccine safety and cost-effectiveness for intervention scaleup.
 Recruitment was sufficiently timely despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which reflects the
 substantial prevalence and readmission rate of heart failure in China. In 2017, the prevalence
 of heart failure in China was estimated to be 1.1% and 1-year readmission rate around 50%
 [25]. The total population of the pilot trial counties is at least 300,000, which may equate to
 3,000 prevalent HF patients [9]. Assuming one-third of these patients require hospitalization
 at any given time, admission rates of at least two per day may be expected. The observed
 recruitment rate of 1.4 patients per day seen in this study is consistent with such estimates.
 These data provide some reassurance given the challenges experienced in recruitment in
 other recent influenza vaccination trials. The multinational IAMI trial included a sample size
 of 2571 of the prespecified 4400 participants recruited between October 2016 to March 2020,
 with COVID-19 pandemic impacts during the latter period of recruitment [26, 27] The IVVE
 trial, a multinational trial which included a tertiary hospital in Beijing China, reached a sample
 size of 5129 participants with HF including 694 from China, comparing to the prespecified tar-
 get of 5000 participants [28, 29]. Despite the encouraging pilot data, recruitment for our
 planned large-scale trial may still be impacted by infectious disease mitigation measures,
 because low level of respiratory virus circulation, will make it hard to detect any effects on clin-
 ical outcomes prevented by influenza vaccination with less or no influenza viruses circulating
 around [30].
 There are few prior randomized controlled trials evaluating a complex intervention to
 improve influenza vaccine coverage in cardiovascular patients. The intervention in this study
 aimed to address three barriers to influenza vaccination, namely low awareness, lack of access
 and unaffordability. Previous studies in various settings showed less VCR changes using differ-
 ent interventions. In 2014/2015 influenza season, a pre-post quasi-experimental study of an
 intervention of healthcare worker recommendation and temporary PoV, improved VCR to 19%
 post-intervention, compared to 0.3% pre-intervention, among community-dwelling older adults
 in China [6]. While the COVID pandemic may have had some impact on VCR in usual care,
 this is unlikely to have been a key factor given other data indicating similar coverage in Chinese
 populations before the pandemic and as recently as 2017 [4, 31]. A cluster randomized trial in
 New Zealand showed that free influenza vaccines improved the VCR to 45% compared to 17%
 in usual practice in a general practitioner setting [32]. A national-level policy change evaluation
 in Europe, including free influenza vaccine, showed VCR decreased in the majority of countries
 after seven years since 2007/2008 influenza season, which potentially could be due to an ineffec-
 tive vaccination campaign, though no clear reasons were presented from the report [33].
 The adaptation of the Intervention components by the health providers, indicates that a
 level of adaptation of the core components, tailored to the local site context would be required
 in the hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. Engaging potential end users to refine an
 intervention showed feasibility to improve VCR to 74% in children and older adults, compared
 to 37% VCR in standard of care group, in primary care setting at urban Guangzhou China, in
 2020/2021 influenza season [34]. The same study conducted at rural setting for its pilot phase
 showed a higher VCR of 91%, similar as our pilot study, in its intervention group. Non-tradi-
 tional settings for influenza vaccination provision, including pharmacies, the home, street cor-
 ners, have been shown to be potentially feasible among underserved population, but these
 have not been evaluated in controlled studies [35, 36]. 
<section> This pilot study has several limitations. The overlapping involvement of staff in both the
 intervention delivery and study procedure may limit “real world” applicability and therefore
 its effectiveness. For example, staff took the opportunity to deliver education on influenza vac-
 cination at the time of obtaining informed consent for study participation. Educating the
 patients as part of the informed consent may need to be incorporated into normal nursing
 care in a real-world setting. The feasibility shown in a small number of pilot hospitals might
 not be generalizable to other settings in China, although they were selected to reflect some
 diversity.
 While this pilot trial suggests feasibility and acceptability of the vaccination strategy in hos-
 pitals, if the large-scale trial demonstrates effectiveness in preventing clinical events, sustain-
 able scale-up will need to consider and address broader issues highlighted in the process
 evaluation. These include the need for policies and public funding to subsidize vaccinations,
 efforts towards health system integration, and wider medical education and health promotion
 to improve professional and community understanding of the risks and benefits of influenza
 vaccination, particularly amongst high-risk individuals.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> Based on this pilot trial, an adequately powered hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of
 influenza vaccination in patients with heart failure can be conducted in county hospitals in
 China. The process evaluation suggests that the proposed intervention strategy to ensure
 uptake of influenza vaccination in patients with heart failure may also be feasible. However,
 careful consideration about equitable funding sources for influenza vaccination, service inte-
 gration, health promotion is needed for future sustainable scaleup.
