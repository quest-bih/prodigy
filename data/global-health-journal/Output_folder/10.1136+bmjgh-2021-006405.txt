<section> Key questions
 
<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► An estimated 22 million episodes of chest-­indrawing
 pneumonia in children less than 5 years of age occur
 every year globally.
 
<section> ► Care-­seeking for childhood pneumonia is low, and
 only 68% seek care from any source.
 
<section> ► The WHO’s integrated management of childhood
 illness chart booklet allows facility-­ based health
 worker to treat chest-­indrawing pneumonia cases
 with a 5-­day course of oral amoxicillin without refer-
 ring them to a hospital.
 
<section> ► However, community-­level health workers (CLHWs)
 are not allowed to treat children with chest-­
 indrawing pneumonia with oral amoxicillin, leading
 to low coverage of pneumonia treatment.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► In the intervention clusters, CLHWs performed pulse
 oximetry and successfully treated non-­hypoxaemic
 children 2–59-­month-­old with chest-­indrawing
 pneumonia with oral amoxicillin, while in the control
 clusters, these children were referred to a higher-­
 level health facility as per the standard management.
 
<section> ► The adjusted risk difference in the treatment failure
 rate in treatment failure rates between the interven-
 tion and control groups was −0.01%, which satisfied
 the prespecified non-­inferiority criterion of the inter-
 vention to the control clusters.
 
<section> ► CLHWs correctly performed pulse oximetry in 91.1%
 of cases in the intervention clusters.
 
<section> Conclusions The community treatment of non-­
 hypoxaemic children with chest-­indrawing pneumonia
 with 5-­d ay oral amoxicillin by trained, equipped
 and supervised CLHWs is non-­inferior to currently
 recommended facility-­b ased treatment. These
 findings encourage a review of the existing strategy of
 community-­b ased management of pneumonia.

<section> INTRODUCTION
 Pneumonia is the number one killer of children
 1–59-­ month-­ old globally, with over 800 000 pneumonia-­
 related deaths every year. 1 The burden of childhood pneu-
 monia morbidity and mortality is higher in sub-­Saharan
 Africa and South Asia than in other regions. 1 2 The WHO
 and UNICEF developed integrated management of child-
 hood illness (IMCI) for healthcare workers at primary
 care facility 3 and integrated community case management
 (iCCM) protocol for community-­ level health workers
 (CLHWs). 4 Both IMCI and iCCM protocols enable
 health workers to identify children with pneumonia using
 clinical signs such as respiratory rate and lower chest-­
 indrawing. 3 4 Globally, an estimated 138 million under-­

<section> children had clinical pneumonia in 2015, and of these, 16%
 (22 million episodes) had chest-­indrawing pneumonia.
 Several studies have shown the effectiveness of oral
 amoxicillin in treating chest-­ indrawing pneumonia in
 children 2–59 months of age. 5–8 Based on this evidence,
 the WHO modified the pneumonia guidelines 9 and
 subsequently IMCI chart booklet to recommend a 5-­day
 course of oral amoxicillin in 2–59-­month-­old children with
 chest-­indrawing pneumonia without referring them to a
 hospital. 3 Two other trials supported the evidence after
 the WHO revision in pneumonia guideline. 10 11 However,
 this recommendation was not extended to CLHWs using
 the iCCM protocol 4 because of insufficient evidence on its
 safety and efficacy at the community level, as it was only
 available from two clinical trials, both from Pakistan. 12
 The only evidence from Africa was from an observational
 implementation research study that showed CLHWs could
 manage chest-­indrawing pneumonia.
 Hypoxaemia is associated with a significantly increased
 risk of death in children with pneumonia. 15 A pulse
 oximeter can non-­invasively measure peripheral oxygen
 saturation (SpO ), and its use at the outpatient level has
 the potential to identify pneumonia with hypoxaemia for
 immediate referral for oxygen and injectable antibiotics
 to a hospital. The WHO recommends oxygen for <90%
 SpO 16 The IMCI chart booklet recommends pulse oxim-
 eter use by a trained healthcare worker to assess hypox-
 aemia in children with cough and or difficulty breathing
 at a primary-­level healthcare facility. 3 However, the iCCM
 protocol does not recommend the use of a pulse oxim-
 eter by a CLHW.
 Improving appropriate care seeking from health facili-
 ties is an important part of IMCI. 3 Prompt recognition of
 pneumonia signs and appropriate care seeking, which is
 essential to reduce pneumonia-­related mortality in under-­5
 children, is a key component of the WHO/UNICEF Global
 Action Plan for the Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea
 framework. 17 However, caregivers’ poor knowledge about
 symptoms and danger signs, faith in traditional care,
 distance to health facilities and cost can affect caregivers’
 ability to seek proper and prompt care from health facil-
 ities. 18–21 Care-­ seeking rates are inversely related to the
 distance to the closest health facility. 22 23 Inappropriate care
 seeking, including traditional care, is common. 18 24 Care
 seeking for children less than 5 years of age with respiratory
 symptoms is 68% globally. 25 The role of CLHWs is crucial
 in improving the care seeking, providing prompt treatment
 and reducing pneumonia mortality in children, especially
 in low resource setting, where access to a health facility is
 difficult. Reduction in mortality, increasing care seeking
 and treatment for pneumonia, malaria and diarrhoea
 through CLHWs was recently demonstrated by the WHO
 Rapid Access Expansion iCCM programmed in the Demo-
 cratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Niger and Nigeria. 26–28
 High-­quality data evaluating the management of chest-­
 indrawing pneumonia by the CLHWs from various
 countries are essential before the iCCM protocol can be
 updated to make it consistent with the IMCI protocol. As 
<section> hypoxaemia can accompany pneumonia, including the use
 of pulse oximetry will assist in the identification of patients
 with a high risk of mortality. We believe it will increase
 care seeking, reduce delayed referrals and provide timely
 and appropriate treatment, especially in hard to reach
 areas where access to health facilities is difficult and where
 referral is not feasible. This study aimed to gather evidence
 on whether CLHWs can safely and effectively treat non-­
 hypoxaemic children 2–59-­month-­old with chest-­indrawing
 with a 5-­day course of oral amoxicillin in a few selected
 countries in Africa and Asia.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Trial design
 
<section> We compared an enhanced management of pneumonia
 package with the standard management of pneumonia at
 the community level based on the iCCM protocol (box 1),
 using a cluster-­ randomised controlled, open-­ label, non-­
 inferiority trial design. The trial was conducted in four
 countries (two in Africa (Ethiopia and Malawi) and two
 in Asia (Bangladesh and India)), which were selected due
 to a high burden of childhood pneumonia and having a
 functional iCCM programme to manage childhood pneu-
 monia.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> Children aged 2–59 months having parents/caregivers
 reported cough and/or difficult breathing presenting to
 a CLHW with chest-­indrawing without any danger signs
 (box 1) were screened for enrolment. Difficult breathing
 was defined, and CLHWs were trained to identify any
 unusual pattern of breathing in their child as described
 by the caregivers, such as ‘fast’ or ‘noisy’ or ‘interrupted’
 or ‘difficulty’ in breathing. We have published detailed
 procedures, implementation of iCCM and the charac-
 teristics of CLHWs country wise elsewhere. 29 Briefly, in
 both intervention and control clusters, CLHWs identified
 2–59-­ month-­ old children with chest-­ indrawing through
 visits by families to CLHWs. A standardised assessment of
 sick children per iCCM protocol was undertaken. 4 CLHWs
 counted respiratory rate using a timer (UNICEF, Copen-
 hagen, Denmark), observed chest-­indrawing and excluded
 those with any danger sign (box 1). Children identified
 by the CLHW as having chest-­indrawing pneumonia were
 re-­examined by a study supervisor within half an hour to
 confirm the presence of chest-­indrawing. Study supervisors
 were qualified nurses or clinical officers, hired and trained
 in the study methodology, supervision and pulse oximetry.
 In cases of disagreement, the supervisor’s measurements
 were considered final.
 The CLHWs worked from 3 to 6 days every week at
 different sites and performed their work for around
 to 8 hours on working days. Except for Bangladesh, the
 CLHWs who lived in the same communities could be
 accessed on the weekend or public holidays by the commu-
 nity members. A fair number of families would seek care
 from CLHWs in the study sites; however, a substantial
 proportion would seek direct care from the health centres
 or hospital or even private providers (at Asian sites) for
 various reasons, including unavailability of the CLHW or
 medicines at the community level or the perception of
 a child being sicker. For more details, see online supple-
 mental Table 1.
 
<section> Interventions
 In the control clusters, all enrolled children were imme-
 diately sent to a referral facility for further management
 as per the standard iCCM protocol, 4 no study-­mandated
 follow-­up by the CLHWs was stipulated, who followed their
 routine practice, whereas, in the intervention clusters,
 enrolled children were treated by a CLHW with a 5-­day
 course of oral amoxicillin dispersible tablets, 50 mg/kg per
 dose two times per day according to WHO age bands. 3 On
 the day of enrolment (day 1), the first dose was given by the
 CLHW and demonstrated to the child’s parent/caregiver,
 and subsequent doses were administered by the parent/
 caregiver at home. If the child vomited within 30 min of
 administration of oral amoxicillin, the dose was readminis-
 tered. The treating CLHWs followed these children on days
 2, 4 and 7 after enrolment to assess for clinical improve-
 ment, need for referral and adherence to therapy.
 CLHWs performed pulse oximetry in the intervention
 clusters to measure SpO using the Rad-­5v pulse oximeter
 2
 (Masimo, Irvine, California) on the great toe in smaller
 infants and toe or thumb in the older children. Study
 supervisors confirmed CLHWs’ SpO measurements to
 identify hypoxaemia (SpO <90%). 16 2 Child was referred
 2
 if the supervisor confirmed the presence of hypoxaemia.
 In the control group, study supervisors performed pulse
 oximetry to identify hypoxaemic children except for the
 Bangladesh site. Children of 2–59-­month-­old with chest-­
 indrawing pneumonia, without danger signs, SpO ≥90%,
 2
 and given informed written consent were enrolled in the
 trial.
 All CLHWs in the control and the intervention clusters,
 study supervisors and outcome assessors were trained in
 iCCM 4 30 through the programme’s existing training system.
 Also, CLHWs in intervention clusters were trained in pulse
 oximetry and treatment of children with oral amoxicillin.
 Hands-­on refresher training was conducted by the inves-
 tigators and study coordinators every 3–6 months. Study
 staff, including supervisors and independent outcome
 assessors, were also trained in pulse oximetry. Study super-
 visors and coordinators regularly validated the clinical
 skills (in both clusters) and pulse oximetry technique (in
 the intervention clusters only) of CLHWs, and those who
 performed poorly received hands-­ on training. Regular
 refresher training was also conducted at each site. Details
 of standardisation, supervision and monitoring process
 have been given elsewhere.
 Preparatory meetings with the Ministry of Health, district
 health officers and community leaders were held at each
 site before data collection. At the Indian site, CLHWs

<section> Study outcomes
 The primary outcome was treatment failure by day
 Treatment failure was defined as (a) death at any time up to
 day 14 of enrolment, or (b) clinical deterioration (defined
 as the presence of a danger sign or SpO <90%) on day 6,
 2
 or (c) persistence of chest-­indrawing on day 6 or (d) devel-
 opment of serious adverse event to amoxicillin by day
 such as anaphylactic reaction, severe diarrhoea or general-
 ised severe rash. The primary outcome was ascertained on
 day 6 (from number b to d) and day 14 (#a) of enrolment
 by independent outcome assessors (clinical officers/nurses
 trained in iCCM and trial methodology) who were unaware
 of the treatment received by the child to reduce potential
 measurement bias. 29 The definitions of the clinical signs
 are given in online supplemental Table 2.
 There were three components of the secondary outcome:
 (1) feasibility of using a pulse oximeter by CLHWs, (2)
 performance of CLHWs for using pulse oximetry against
 cough for 14 days or more, diarrhoea for 14 days or
 or more, convulsions or fits, difficult drinking or feeding

 ment outcomes. 29 However, in this paper, we only present
 the findings of the second and third components of the
 secondary outcome, and the results for the first outcome
 will be presented separately.
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> For sample size calculation, a 5000 population with a 3%
 birth rate was assumed per cluster, which gave 750 under
 5 children at any point over a 2-­year trial’s data collection
 period. Using a pneumonia incidence rate of 0.25 per child
 per year, 375 pneumonia cases per cluster per trial’s data
 collection period were estimated. Of these estimated cases,
 15% were assumed as chest-­indrawing pneumonia, leading
 to 50 children 2–59 months of age with chest-­indrawing
 pneumonia per cluster during the trial’s data collection
 period. If there is truly no difference between the standard
 iCCM and enhanced iCCM (assuming 10% treatment
 failure in both groups based on previous research, 12 13 with
 a design effect of 1.6 and attrition of 10%, then 1340 chil-
 dren 2–59 months of age with chest-­indrawing pneumonia 
<section> per group were required to be 90% sure that the upper
 limit of a two-­sided 95% CI will exclude a difference in
 favour of the standard iCCM of >5%, assuming >50%
 difference in the treatment failure). We expected 30 cases
 per cluster over the data collection period, so 90 clusters
 (45 per group) were required for random allocation.
 A parallel trial in young infants up to 2 months with fast
 breathing pneumonia was also carried out at the same trial
 sites and at the same time, which required 99 clusters in
 each group. 32 33 We chose the same number of clusters for
 this trial also, instead of the required 45 in each group.
 
<section> Randomisation
 Clusters were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either
 standard management (control) or enhanced manage-
 ment (intervention) of pneumonia. Union in Bangladesh,
 Sub-­centre in India and Health Centre in Ethiopia and
 Malawi were the randomisation units. We performed strat-
 ified randomisation using the cluster’s median or above
 population as the first stratum and below the median popu-
 lation as the second stratum. The computer-­ generated
 randomisation lists were prepared off-­ site by the WHO
 co-­ordinating office in Geneva not involved with the study
 for each site. For Bangladesh, 52 clusters (26 intervention
 and 26 control) were randomly selected out of 54; two were
 dropped due to odd numbers in both strata. For Ethiopia,
 20 clusters (10 intervention and 10 control) were randomly
 selected. For the India site, 92 clusters (46 intervention and
 46 control) were randomly selected out of 95; three were
 dropped due to odd numbers in both strata. For Malawi,
 44 clusters (22 intervention and 22 control) were randomly
 selected out of 46 health centres, two were dropped due to
 odd number in both strata (more details were published
 elsewhere).
 
<section> Oversight and statistical methods
 A technical steering committee and data safety and moni-
 toring board (DSMB) provided oversight of the trial. Ethics
 approvals were obtained from the WHO Ethics Review
 Committee and the respective institutional ethics commit-
 tees at each trial site. Informed written consent in the local
 language was obtained from the parent/caregiver and in
 the presence of a witness if the parent/caregiver was illit-
 erate. The trial was performed by the principles of the
 Declaration of Helsinki.
 Standard case report forms were used to collect data. All
 sites performed double data entry into a centralised data-
 base maintained by the Data Coordinating Centre (DCC).
 All sites uploaded a cleaned database to the DCC every
 month for quality checks. A planned interim analysis was
 conducted and reviewed by the DSMB after nearly 75%
 enrolment. As the enrolment rates were higher in Asian
 sites than African sites, the DSMB recommended ceasing
 enrolment at Asian sites (Bangladesh and India) in mid-­
 2018 while continuing enrolment at African sites till the
 end of the year.
 Descriptive statistics were used to calculate frequencies
 and percentages. Based on a predefined analysis plan to test
 for non-­inferiority in the treatment failure rate between the
 intervention and control clusters, the difference in risk of
 treatment failure with a 95% CI was calculated and adjusted
 for sites and clusters. Post hoc prespecified subgroup anal-
 yses were performed to examine the difference in risk of
 treatment failure with 95% CI between intervention and
 control clusters.
 For secondary outcomes, descriptive analyses were
 performed to evaluate the accuracy and impact of the use
 of pulse oximeter by CLHWs in intervention clusters. All
 analyses were performed using Stata V.14.2 (Stata-­Corp,
 College Station, Texas).
 
<section> Role of the funding source
 This study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates
 Foundation (#OPP1109076/INV-­0 08068) through a
 grant to the WHO. The funders had no role in the
 study design or the collection, analysis or interpreta-
 tion of the data. The funders did not write the report
 and had no role in the decision to submit the paper
 for publication.
 
<section> Patient and public involvement statement
 The development of the research question was
 informed by the large burden of pneumonia-­related
 mortality among children worldwide. Patients were
 not advisers in this study, nor were they involved
 in the design, recruitment or conduct of the study.
 Results of this study will be made publicly available
 through open-­a ccess publication where study partici-
 pants may access them.
 
<section> RESULTS
 Enrolment, patient flow and baseline characteristics
 CLHWs screened 62 363 children who presented with cough
 and/or difficulty in breathing at all four trial sites in both
 clusters, intervention (104 clusters and 32 029 children) and
 control (104 clusters and 30 334 children) (figure 1). Online
 supplemental Table 3 presents the distribution of danger
 signs identified by the CLHWs during screening. Of 4206
 children, 2–59-­month-­old with chest-­indrawing, 57 (1.4%)
 had hypoxaemia, 106 (2.5%) were previously enrolled and
 30 (0.7%) did not give consent. We enrolled 2146 children
 in the intervention and 1867 in the control clusters. CLHWs
 followed 2113 (98.5%), 2090 (97.4%) and 1871 (87.2%) on
 day 2, 4 and 7 after enrolment in the intervention clusters
 (see online supplemental Table 4 for more details). Primary
 outcome data were available for 2081 children in interven-
 tion and 1816 in control clusters.
 The data collection phase was carried out in Bangladesh
 between December 2016 and May 2018, Ethiopia between
 September 2016 and December 2018, India between March
 2017 and May 2018 and Malawi between December 2016
 and July 2017. There were no important differences between
 cluster and individual level baseline characteristics for the
 intervention and control clusters at all four sites (table 1).

<section> Secondary outcome
 In the intervention clusters, CLHWs performed pulse
 oximetry on 2255 children with chest-­indrawing, and in
 91.1% (2001/2196) of cases, they performed all steps of
 pulse oximetry assessment according to the instructions
 (table 3). The median (IQR) of SpO reading was 97% (94%
 2
 and 99%). Compared with supervisors’ pulse oximeter read-
 ings, readings by CLHWs were either the same or within
 2% of supervisors’ reading for 86.6% (1901/2196) of the
 patients. Thirty-­ six (1.6%) children had SpO <90% and
 2
 
<section> were referred immediately to the hospital, and all of them
 survived after 14 days after the initial assessment. Online

<section> Adherence to treatment
 Treatment adherence was good in the intervention clusters
 as 83.8% (1724/2058) of the patients received all 10 doses of
 amoxicillin for 5 days, and only 3.5% (73/2058) consumed
 less than 4 days of medicine (table 4). In the control clusters,
 10.5% (167/1594) received hospitalised treatment, while
 80.3% (1280/1594) received outpatient treatment.

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> Principal findings
 Our results demonstrate that 2–59-­ month-­ old non-­
 hypoxaemic children with chest-­ indrawing, 5-­ day
 oral amoxicillin treatment by trained, supervised and
 equipped CLHWs were non-­ inferior to referral to a
 health facility for treatment. Children treated in the
 community by the CLHWs had a similar treatment failure
 rate to those referred to a health facility.
 
<section> Comparison with other literature
 Two similar trials from Pakistan also showed that
 community-­ based treatment of chest-­ indrawing pneu-
 monia was safe and effective. 12 13 In the Haripur, Pakistan
 trial, children 2–59-­month-­old with chest-­indrawing who
 received oral amoxicillin treatment from CLHWs had a
 significantly lower treatment failure rate (9%) than those
 who received the standard management of assessment
 and referred to a facility (18%). 12 In the Matiari, Paki-
 stan trial, children who received oral amoxicillin treat-
 ment from CLHWs had a non-­ significant lower treat-
 ment failure rate (8%) than those who received standard
 care (13%). 13 The treatment failure rates in both these
 trials 12 13 were higher than those reported in our trial. We
 believe that a few treatment failure criteria used in these
 trials, that is, presence of fever plus lower chest-­indrawing
 on day 3 of treatment, presence of fever on day 6 and
 change of antibiotic, 12 13 were not used in our trial. When
 we recalculated the treatment failure for the Haripur,
 Pakistan trial using our trial treatment failure defini-
 tion, the treatment failure in the intervention group was
 5.8% vs 8.6% in the control group (non-­significant risk
 difference −2.8%). Also, we performed pulse oximetry to
 exclude hypoxaemic children, while no pulse oximetry
 was carried out in those trials. 12 13 Similar to our study,
 these trials reported a low mortality rate (<1%) in both
 intervention and control groups. 12 13 This could be attrib-
 uted to the careful selection of study participants who did
 not have signs of very severe disease or other comorbidity
 and to the timely and appropriate treatment provided.
 Few observational studies from community and health
 facility levels have reported lower chest-­indrawing pneu-
 monia from Africa. 14 34–37 In a large community-­based
 study in Homabay county, Kenya, CHWs were success-
 fully able to treat children with lower chest-­indrawing in 
<section> the majority of cases and reported a low treatment failure
 rate (2.1%) and five deaths (0.3%), which are similar to
 our data. 14 A pneumococcal vaccine study from Malawi
 introduced pulse oximeter use by health facility workers
 and CLHWs, 34 35 which substantially increased the
 referral to the hospitals for pneumonia cases, especially
 those with hypoxaemia. The proportion of hypoxaemic
 children identified by CLHWs with SpO <90% (1.2%)
 2
 and those with SpO 90%–92% was a little lower than the
 2
 proportion in our own study (figure 1 and table 3). Simi-
 larly, those with danger signs of pneumonia were also
 similar (<1%). Both hypoxaemic and danger sign pneu-
 monia cases were excluded from enrolment in our study.
 However, the proportion of chest-­indrawing patients in
 our community-­based study was higher than that reported
 by the Malawi vaccine study for CLHWs. 35 Another obser-
 vational study from Malawi that linked community-­based
 and health centre-­based data with the hospital admission
 data reported that all deaths in the hospitalised pneu-
 monia patients occurred within 24 hours of admission,
 which could be due to delay in appropriate care seeking.
 
<section> Interpretation and implications of the findings
 There are a few potential reasons why the community-­level
 treatment of children with chest-­indrawing pneumonia
 was non-­inferior to the facility-­based treatment (standard
 iCCM protocols) and why we observed low treatment
 failure rates in both the intervention and control clus-
 ters. The treatment success depends on early recognition
 of pneumonia by the families or CLHWs, prompt care
 seeking from trained healthcare providers and timely and
 appropriate treatment. In our study, families sought early
 care from the trained CLHWs or community volunteers
 present in their communities, or they received home
 visits by them. The CLHWs in the intervention clusters
 provided prompt and appropriate treatment to the chil-
 dren with chest-­indrawing pneumonia. The CLHWs in
 the control clusters immediately referred them to the
 referral level facilities after giving them a prereferral anti-
 biotic dose. Thus, delayed referrals and failure to seek
 appropriate care, which are important determinants of
 treatment failure and pneumonia mortality, were avoided
 in both groups. 18
 Where access to health facilities is easy, and good quality
 care is available, management of chest-­indrawing pneu-
 monia by the CLHWs may not be necessary. However,
 in places where access is poor, including remote areas,
 difficult terrains, and humanitarian settings, treatment
 of chest-­ indrawing pneumonia and the use of pulse
 oximetry to assess hypoxaemia by CLHWs could poten-
 tially save lives. Treating chest-­ indrawing pneumonia
 at the community level has some potential advantages,
 including cost saving, ease for the families, getting treat-
 ment from someone the family knows and who is acces-
 sible and provides higher satisfaction than facility-­based
 care. 39 40 One cannot overlook the economic cost of out
 of pocket expenses for seeking care at the health facilities
 for treatment of pneumonia, which can be manifold
 higher than the community-­level treatment cost. 41–43
 There are useful lessons from this trial for iCCM of
 pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria programmes. First,
 sustaining the clinical skills of CLHWs over time is chal-
 lenging, 44 especially in settings where only a few sick chil-
 dren are seen weekly at the community level. Ongoing
 supervision, training and mentoring are required to
 ensure consistent quality of care. 45–48 Second, a regular
 supply of essential commodities to avoid stockouts is
 imperative. 48 Third, CLHWs accurately performed pulse
 oximetry to identify hypoxaemic children with pneu-
 monia, who were referred immediately to a hospital for
 further management, and all survived up to 2 weeks of
 follow-­up. When adequately trained, regularly monitored
 and supervised, and supplied with appropriate equipment
 (pulse oximeter, paediatric probes), CLHWs performed
 pulse oximetry correctly in children with chest-­indrawing
 pneumonia. We selected the cut-­off value for hypoxaemia
 (SpO <90%) as recommended by the WHO, 16 although
 2
 some data have been published about SpO between 90%
 and 93% as a risk factor for pneumonia 2 mortality. 15
 Among the 10 deaths in this study, 9/10 (90%) had a
 SpO of 93%–100%, and 1 (10%) had an SpO between
 2 2
 90% and <93% (online supplemental Table 3). However,
 the low proportion (<2%) of hypoxaemia in children
 with chest-­indrawing pneumonia seen in our study and
 elsewhere 34 raises questions about the use of pulse oxim-
 etry at the community level. Implementation of pulse
 oximetry at the CLHW level is not inconsequential. It
 brings forth real issues regarding ensuring the quality
 with the use of pulse oximeter, selection of an appro-
 priate pulse oximeter and age-­specific probes and that it
 does not replace the clinical examination. Additionally,
 the health system support and scale-­up requirements will
 require another level of engagement and investment by
 the policymakers and implementers. Further research is
 required in various geographic regions to evaluate the
 use of pulse oximeters by CLHWs, especially in resource-­
 limited communities where access to a primary-­ level
 healthcare facility is poor. Finally, the existing large-­scale
 iCCM programmes would need some implementation
 experience to learn about barriers and facilitators before
 scaling up the inclusion of chest-­indrawing pneumonia
 treatment.
 There are two major interlinked concerns with the
 empiric use of antibiotics to treat pneumonia at the
 community level. First, pneumonia in many of these
 children with lower chest-­ indrawing is non-­ bacterial
 that does not need an antibiotic, and second, the use of
 antibiotics by CLHWs may contribute to antimicrobial
 resistance. 50 51 Until a good point of care, test is available
 to differentiate viral from bacterial infections, empiric
 antibiotic therapy is a useful tool to reduce pneumonia
 mortality. WHO standard case management of pneu-
 monia promotes the rational use of antibiotics, 52 53 which
 has also been demonstrated through CLHWs treatment
 of pneumonia in Zambia. 54 To reduce antibiotic use and 
<section> minimise antimicrobial resistance, more needs to be
 done. Recently, treatment with a shorter 3-­day oral amox-
 icillin was shown to be non-­inferior to a 5-­day standard
 course in Malawian children with chest-­indrawing at a
 health facility level. 55 Further data are needed from other
 regions to validate these findings.
 
<section> Strengths and limitations
 The strength of this trial is that this is a large multicountry
 trial that leveraged existing iCCM infrastructure across
 four African and Asian countries and demonstrated
 that the community-­ level treatment of children with
 chest-­indrawing pneumonia is safe and feasible across a
 wide range of settings and seasons. Thus, these findings
 contribute to the body of evidence that CLHWs can effec-
 tively treat chest-­indrawing pneumonia in low-­resource
 settings, especially in areas where access to health centres
 is limited. 12–14 Our trial also demonstrated the ability of
 CLHWs to use pulse oximetry successfully at the commu-
 nity level to make iCCM safer. Finally, the large sample
 size was adequate to detect a smaller non-­ inferiority
 margin, which was appropriate given the observed lower
 failure rate.
 Our study had the limitation of using the WHO crite-
 rion of chest-­indrawing pneumonia for diagnosis as the
 standard tools of radiology and microbiology were not
 feasible in the community setting. No single clinical sign
 can diagnose radiological pneumonia definitively, 56 57 but
 in a meta-­analysis, chest-­indrawing along with respiratory
 rate higher than 50 bpm, grunting and nasal flaring,
 had the highest pooled estimates of the positive likeli-
 hood ratio for radiological pneumonia. 56 On the other
 hand, determining the aetiology in physician-­diagnosed
 hospitalised children with pneumonia is difficult even
 when multiple samples from multiples sites are tested in
 high-­quality laboratories shown by the PERCH study.
 Thus, it is likely that our study included children with
 non-­ bacterial chest-­ indrawing pneumonia who were
 treated with antibiotics. However, because our primary
 outcome of treatment failure (excluding death) was
 only measured on day 6 of enrolment by independent
 outcome assessors, we believe that practically all children
 with only viral pneumonia would have gotten better by
 then and had minimal effect on the primary outcome.
 We enrolled a relatively higher number of children from
 Asian sites compared with African sites, instead of equal
 numbers. However, the subanalysis showed no difference
 in treatment failure rates between the intervention and
 control clusters in Asian and African sites.
 
<section> CONCLUSIONS
 This large multicountry trial showed that trained, super-
 vised and equipped with oral amoxicillin CLHWs can safely
 and effectively treat non-­ hypoxaemic 2–59-­ months-­ old
 children with chest-­ indrawing with a 5-­ day oral amox-
 icillin course in the community. CLHWs performed
 pulse oximetry correctly in most cases. Treatment of
 chest-­indrawing pneumonia in children 2–59-­months-­old
 by CLHWs would increase access, particularly in settings
 where access to a health facility is limited and referral to a
 health facility is not feasible. This evidence should be used
 to review the current WHO/UNICEF iCCM protocol.
