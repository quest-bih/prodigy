<section> Evidence before this study
 Tuberculosis diagnostic algorithms often recommend
 prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics for patients whose
 initial sputum tests are negative (trial-of-antibiotics), assuming
 that post-antibiotic symptom improvement rules out
 tuberculosis. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health
 on Feb 18, 2023, using the combined terms for “tuberculosis”,
 “antibiotic treatment”, terms for diagnostic accuracy
 (“sensitivity”, “specificity”, and “predictive value”), and a filter for
 randomised trials. We searched for randomised trials published
 from database inception to Feb 18, 2023, with no language
 restrictions, and found no relevant publications. Our systematic
 review and meta-analysis that pooled available observational
 data (only eight studies), concluded that trial-of-antibiotics was
 yet to be supported by evidence, and the meta-analysis
 suggested that diagnostic performance was low. Not one of the
 identified studies systematically assessed the effect on other
 clinical outcomes and antimicrobial resistance.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 To our knowledge, this study is the first randomised trial to
 investigate the diagnostic, clinical, and the effect on
 
<section> antibiotic courses are prescribed globally every year,
 meaning that trial-of-antibiotics is likely to be the most
 commonly used tuberculosis triage test 8–10 and a
 potentially important contributor to antimicrobial
 
<section> resistance. 
<section> 11–13
 In addition to uncertain diagnostic performance and
 concerns about antimicrobial resistance, patient safety
 and effectiveness in improving clinical outcomes are key
 underinvestigated considerations when trials-of-
 antibiotics are used in tuberculosis diagnostic algorithms.
 The potential for clinical benefit is based on the high risk
 of bacterial infections in patients undergoing tuberculosis
 investigations. 14–16 We aimed to conduct a randomised
 controlled trial (the accuracy and consequences of using
 trial-of-antibiotics for tuberculosis diagnosis [ACT-TB]) to
 investigate the effect of a trial-of-antibiotic intervention
 on diagnostic, clinical, and antimicrobial resistance
 outcomes in Malawi.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> We conducted this three-arm, individually randomised,
 open-label, controlled trial among adults who presented
 with cough for at least 14 days at two primary care
 centres in Blantyre, Malawi. The study design has been
 described in detail elsewhere 17 and the protocol and
 statistical analysis plan are available in
 
<section> See 
<section> Online for appendix the appendix (pp 5, 84). The study was reviewed and
 approved by the Kamuzu University of Health Sciences
 Research and Ethics Committee, London School of
 Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Research Ethics
 
<section> antimicrobial resistance of trial-of-antibiotics to rule out
 tuberculosis. Compared with standard of care, trial-of-
 antibiotics with either azithromycin or amoxicillin modestly
 improved diagnostic specificity for mycobacteriologically
 confirmed tuberculosis, and provided weak evidence for
 increased risk of antimicrobial resistance. There was no effect
 on the composite clinical outcome (coprimary) of missed
 tuberculosis diagnosis, hospitalisation, or death.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 These results confirm the limited benefit of trial-of-antibiotics
 in tuberculosis screening algorithms, presenting an opportunity
 for discontinuation of routine prescription of trial-of-
 antibiotics and improved antimicrobial stewardship, without
 affecting clinical outcomes. National tuberculosis and
 antimicrobial stewardship programmes should restrict
 prescription of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics to patients
 in which strong clinical or microbiological indication exists.
 New affordable and point-of-care diagnostics for tuberculosis
 and other respiratory pathogens are urgently needed to address
 the unmet clinical need.

<section> Participants
 
<section> We introduced the study to adults presenting to either
 Limbe or Ndirande Health Centres in Blantyre, Malawi,
 by first inviting all participants with a cough to a brief
 talk, and then conducted a detailed eligibility screen for
 those who expressed interest. We included patients who
 were aged at least 18 years, who had a cough, who reported
 being unwell for at least 14 days, and who did not have
 any danger signs (respiratory rate ≥30 breaths per min,
 temperature ≥39°C, heart rate ≥120 beats per min,
 confusion or agitation, respiratory distress, and systolic
 blood pressure of <90 mm Hg). We excluded patients
 who reported allergies to study medications, who had
 taken antibiotics other than co-trimoxazole prophylaxis
 within the previous 14 days, or had taken tuberculosis
 drugs either for treatment or prevention within the
 previous 6 months. To participate, eligible patients
 provided written (or, if not literate, witnessed thumbprint)
 informed consent.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 We used block-randomisation with variable block sizes,
 stratified by study site, to allocate participants (1:1:1) to
 either standard of care (no study antibiotic prescription),
 azithromycin (azithromycin 500 mg taken once per day
 for 3 days, from enrolment day, termed day 1), or
 amoxicillin (amoxicillin 1 g taken three times per day for 
<section> 5 days, from day 1). An independent statistician prepared detected
 a randomisation list using the ralloc command in Stata. on day

<insert> antiretroviral therapy (ART) (table 1). The participant
 recruitment period preceded the earliest known
 COVID-19 infections in Blantyre, Malawi.
 Out of the randomised 1583 participants 1171 (74·0%)
 provided a sputum sample for day 1 Xpert MTB/RIF, 1181
 (51·7%) for day 1 smear microscopy and culture, 818 for
 day 8 smear microscopy and culture, and 65 (4·1%) for
 unscheduled day 29 smear microscopy and culture based
 on clinical need (appendix p 2). The prevalence of
 tuberculosis by day 8 (positive mycobacteriology at day 1,
 day 8, or both) was 6·3% (100 of 1583). By day 29, an
 additional five mycobacteriologically confirmed cases
 and 28 clinically diagnosed cases were identified giving a
 prevalence of 8·4% (133). We recorded 12 serious adverse
 events (appendix p 4), which included four deaths and
 eight hospitalisations. None of the events was related to
 the study treatment. All events were reported to the data
 and safety monitoring board.
 More participants missed the day 8 visit (35 [3%] of
 1583) than day 29 visit (24 [1·5%]; figure). Reasons for
 missing the day 8 visit were not systematically recorded,
 but 24 participants missed the day 29 visits due to

 1162 participants with negative mycobacteriology and

 accuracy primary outcome (392 [34%] of 1162 in the
 standard of care group, 383 [33%] in the azithromycin
 group, and 387 [33%] in the amoxicillin group). This
 sample size achieved the required number of tuberculosis-
 negative participants per group (around 388 participants)
 without needing the planned full recruitment of 625 per
 group (or 1875 total) because tuberculosis prevalence had
 declined from the anticipated 20% to 6%.
 310 (79·1%) of 392 patients receiving standard of care
 reported symptom improvement at day 8, compared with

<section> When participants who could not produce sputum
 were included in the denominator for the diagnostic
 effect outcome (diagnostic accuracy secondary outcome),
 trial-of-antibiotics with either azithromycin (439 [90·5%]
 of 485) or amoxicillin (441 [91·1%] of 484) still showed
 improvement in specificity compared with standard of
 care (398 [82·6%] of 482), although the effect was smaller
 than in the primary outcome analysis (table 2).
 The sensitivity of the three arms against the
 primary reference mycobacteriology was 25·6% (10 of
 patients; 95% CI 13·0–42·1) for standard of care, 10·7%
 (3 of 28 patients; 2·3–28·2) for azithromycin, and 23·3%
 (7 of 30 patients; 9·9–42·3) for amoxicillin (appendix
 p 3). In post-hoc analyses, the diagnostic sensitivity
 remained very low and similar to the standard of care
 (standard of care 25·0% [95% CI 12·7–41·2%],
 azithromycin 10·7% [2·3–28·2%], and amoxicillin
 22·6% [9·6–41·1%]) when all mycobacteriology from day
 1, day 8, and day 29 were included in the reference
 standard, and did not improve (standard of care 26·1%
 [95% CI 14·3–41·1%], azithromycin 15·8% [6·0–31·3%],
 and amoxicillin 23·8% [12·1–39·5%]) after including
 clinical diagnoses (appendix p 3).
 Compared with standard of care (7 [1·3%] of 530), the
 percentage of participants who experienced the day
 composite clinical outcome (at least one of death,
 hospitalisation, or missed tuberculosis diagnosis) did not
 differ by group (azithromycin –0·2%, 95% CI –1·5 to 1·1;
 and amoxicillin 1·0%, –0·6 to 2·6; table 3).
 1529 of 1583 participants (96·6% of the total

 In a post-hoc analysis excluding 139 participants who

 The improvement in diagnostic specificity shown
 by trial-of-antibiotics using either azithromycin or
 amoxicillin confirms the long-established clinical
 rationale for national and global guidelines for addressing
 the suboptimal nature of tuberculosis diagnosis. Our
 randomised trial further adds to the body of evidence by
 quantifying the magnitude of the diagnostic benefit
 allowing for a comparison against the WHO criteria
 (target product profiles) for tuberculosis diagnostic test
 performance. 26 The WHO target product profiles use
 specificity of more than 80% and sensitivity more than
 95% as benchmarks for an ideal triage test, and specificity 
<section> Articles
 
<section> of more than 98% and sensitivity more than 95% for
 smear microscopy-replacement test. 26 With respect to
 specificity (primary outcome), the 88·8% (340 of 383)
 recorded in the azithromycin group and the 89·4% (346
 of 387) in the amoxicillin group meet the target for triage
 test but fall below that of smear microscopy-replacement
 tests aimed for health facility use.
 In this study, the limited nature of the diagnostic
 benefit is further underscored by the extremely low
 sensitivity for both azithromycin (three [10·7%] of
 28 participants) and amoxicillin (seven [23·3%] of
 30 participants; appendix p 3). We did not include
 sensitivity as a trial outcome, due to the anticipation of
 much lower numbers of sputum-confirmed patients than
 sputum-negative patients but did anticipate sufficient
 power to provide reasonable precision around the point
 estimate of sensitivity per group for which at least
 30 confirmed patients per group is required. These
 estimates fall well below target, even when only the upper
 95% CIs are considered (28·2% for azithromycin, and
 42·3% for amoxicillin) against the minimum acceptable
 target of 90% for triage test, and more than 80% for
 smear microscopy-replacement tests.
 Apart from diagnostic performance, safety is the other
 key consideration for national programmes and clinicians
 before routine prescription of trial-of-antibiotics to
 outpatients without danger signs can be discontinued.
 Withholding a course of effective antibiotic treatment
 could affect patient safety because bacterial causes of
 illness in patients with respiratory symptoms are
 common, 14,27 and are an important cause of hospitalisation
 and mortality. 14–16 The lack of difference in the risk of
 death, hospitalisations, and missed tuberculosis diagnosis
 between participants in the standard of care group and
 those taking trial-of-antibiotics (azithromycin or
 amoxicillin groups) is reassuring and strengthens the
 argument for discontinuation of routine prescription of
 broad-spectrum antibiotics to outpatients with respiratory
 symptoms. However, the lack of difference could also be
 explained by the fact that we registered very low morbidity
 and mortality, which reduced the study power below
 anticipated for this outcome.
 Our safety data results are consistent with those from
 a 2017 systematic review update comparing immediate
 prescription with antibiotic-sparing strategies for
 outpatients with uncomplicated acute respiratory
 infections. 28 That review reported no difference in
 clinical outcomes between delayed, immediate, and no
 prescribed antibiotics for patients with cough, but was
 based on only four studies with limited geographical
 range. 28 Our study adds to the available data on people
 living with HIV, a major factor affecting cause,
 management, and prognosis of acute respiratory
 infection. 29 14·9% of participants in this trial were HIV
 positive. However, our results might not be generalisable
 to settings with high HIV prevalence with lower coverage
 of diagnosis and ART because very few (6%) were newly
 diagnosed and 97% of those previously diagnosed were
 already taking ART. We did not conduct a predefined
 subgroup analysis of clinical outcomes by HIV status
 due to the low event rate.
 We additionally found results consistent with previous
 reports of rapid acquisition of resistance following brief
 exposure to azithromycin, 30,31 with the risk of resistant
 nasal pneumococcal isolates being 2·5% (95% CI
 –0·5 to 5·5) higher for patients randomised to receive
 azithromycin compared with standard of care. The
 difference was greater when patients with pre-existing
 (baseline) antimicrobial resistance were excluded from
 the analysis (3·1%, 95% CI 0·1 to 6·1). These results
 add to the already existing strong body of evidence on
 the association between empirical antibiotic treatment
 and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. 32–34 We saw
 no similar suggestion of rapid emergence of resistance
 in the amoxicillin group, despite higher pre-existing
 rates of resistance in Blantyre, Malawi, and lower
 treatment adherence for amoxicillin compared with
 azithromycin. 35 Unlike amoxicillin, azithromycin has a
 long half-life 36 due to extensive uptake in tissues, 36,37
 which has been postulated to lead to a wide mutant
 selection window (drug concentration range in which
 resistant mutants are selectively amplified), potentially
 allowing greater mutant amplification than is seen with
 
<section> amoxicillin. 
<section> 30,38
 Antibiotic prescription for patients presenting with
 respiratory symptoms was common practice at the
 study sites, with 46·7% (503 of 1076) of the potential
 participants excluded due to having taken antibiotics
 within 14 days, and self-reported use of non-study
 antibiotics by day 29 reported by 15·1% (80 of 530) of
 standard of care group participants. The most common
 non-study antibiotic was amoxicillin, consistent with
 previous reports of wide availability and easy access in
 Malawi. 39 Taking non-study antibiotics would tend to
 drive our antimicrobial resistance day 29 measures
 of effect towards the null by increasing risk of
 resistance (in the standard of care group) or by clearing
 carriage (trial-of-antibiotic groups). However, post-hoc
 analysis of the antimicrobial resistance outcome
 excluding participants who reported missing at least
 one tablet of their study medication, and those who
 reported taking any non-study antibiotic by day 29, did
 not have any effect on effect measures.
 Our main study limitations include no blinding and
 consequential room for misclassifying exposure status
 for participants who could have accessed antibiotics
 outside the study beyond that reported, and possible
 underdiagnosis of active tuberculosis status. However,
 exploratory analysis of different tuberculosis diagnostic
 criteria and exclusion of patients known to have taken
 antibiotics outside of the study prescriptions do not
 support a major impact on our key conclusions. Another
 potential source of misclassification of exposure status is
 the self-administration of study drugs, but this reflects
