<section> Abstract
 
<section> International agencies recommend integrating addiction treatment into primary care for peo-
 ple who inject drugs (PWID) with opioid use disorder (OUD). Empirical data supporting inte-
 gration that incorporates comprehensive health outcomes, however, are not known. For this
 randomized controlled trial in Ukraine, adult PWID with OUD were randomized to receive
 opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in specialty addiction treatment clinics (SATC) or to primary
 care clinics (PCCs). For those randomized to PCC, they were subsequently allocated to
 PCCs where clinicians received pay-for-performance (P4P) incentives (PCC with P4P) or
 not (PCC without P4P). Participating cities had one of each of the three intervention sites
 control for geographic variation. Ongoing tele-education specialty training (OAT, HIV, tuber-
 culosis) was provided to all PCCs. While the primary outcome for the parent trial focuses on
 patient medical record data, this preliminary analysis focuses on assessment of self-
 reported achievement of nationally recommended quality health indicators (QHIs) which is
 summed as a composite QHI score. Secondary outcomes included specialty and primary
 care QHI subscores. This study occurred from 01/20/2018-11/1/2020 with 818 of 990 ran-
 domized participants having complete self-reported data for analysis. Relative to SATC
 (treatment as usual), the mean composite QHI score was 12.7 (95% CI: 10.1–15.3;
 p<0.001) percentage points higher at PCCs; similar and significantly higher scores were
 observed in PCCs compared to SATCs for both primary care (PCC vs SATC: 18.4 [95% CI:
 14.8–22.0; p<0.001] and specialty (PCC vs SATC: 5.9 [95% CI: 2.6–9.2; p<0.001] QHI
 scores. Additionally, the mean composite QHI score was 4.6 (95% CI: 2.0–7.2; p<0.001)

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Opioid agonist therapies (OAT) are the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder
 (OUD) [1] and their scale-up is crucial to mitigate the rapidly evolving HIV epidemic in East-
 ern Europe, which is largely concentrated among people who inject drugs (PWID) with OUD
 [2, 3]. Modeling studies suggest that OAT scale-up is necessary for controlling the HIV epi-
 demic and reducing death in Ukraine and similar Eastern European and Central Asian coun-
 tries [4–6] where OAT and other HIV program coverage is sub-optimal [2, 3]. Mathematical
 modeling studies suggest that the most cost effective and feasible way to scale-up OAT in
 Ukraine is through expansion from specialty addiction treatment clinics (SATC) to primary
 care clinics (PCC) due to a limited number of specialists and the need for geographic diversity
 [7]. By year-end 2019, OAT was prescribed for only 4.5% of PWID with OUD in Ukraine, well
 below internationally recommended targets [8], in part due to the low number of addiction
 treatment specialists to support OAT scale-up [7].
 PWID with OUD have high levels of co-morbid conditions that contribute to increased
 mortality [9]. On average, these individuals die 10–25 years earlier than the overall population,
 mostly from conditions that can be screened for and treated in PCCs [10, 11]. Until a recent
 pilot demonstration project [12], OAT was unavailable in PCCs in Ukraine and limited to
 SATCs that commonly provide co-located HIV and/or tuberculosis (TB) services [13], but no
 primary care. SAT clinics are fewer in number, often have inconvenient locations, and limited
 hours of operation [12, 13]. Integrating services into a single location such as PCCs can
 increase access to clinical care, reduce the long waiting lists generally found at specialty loca-
 tions, and increase uptake of recommended healthcare services [12–16].
 In November 2017, the national legislation governing OAT delivery in Ukraine was
 changed to allow OAT to be provided in any healthcare setting, including PCCs, and not
 restricted to addiction treatment specialists, thus forming the basis for integrating OAT into
 PCCs [7, 12]. Simultaneously, the National Health Service (NHS) of Ukraine, which pays clin-
 ics based on the number of patients and type of care provided to patients, was created as part
 of the first stage of a national healthcare reform to strengthen primary care.
 Although there is increasing evidence and recommendations supporting the expansion of
 OAT into PCCs globally, previous studies have identified that lack of training, stigma and neg-
 ative attitudes towards OAT prevent non-specialists from providing care to PWID [12, 13, 17,
 18]. To address this problem, tele-education platforms that connect non-specialists with spe-
 cialists have been adapted from Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes
 (ECHO) to provide education, training, support and consultation via tele-health technology
 [19]. Project ECHO has becoming increasingly popular internationally [20] and has the poten-
 tial to positively impact the global epidemics of drug injection and HIV. This method of train-
 ing, however, had not yet been deployed in Ukraine. 
<section> Healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) like Ukraine are mostly
 underpaid and seldom receive incentives for their performance [17, 21]. Providing pay-for-
 performance (P4P) incentives to physicians is recommended by the World Health Organiza-
 tion and the Institute of Medicine to improve quality of care [15, 22, 23]. To direct P4P incen-
 tives and assess the level of care patients receive, clinical management, government
 organizations and researchers have increasingly used quality health indicators (QHIs) [24].
 Wiessing et al. [25] emphasize using standardized QHIs for PWIDs to better understand the
 healthcare they are receiving; however, few empirical studies have made use of standardized
 QHIs for PWID [13, 26].
 To address the need to expand OAT nationally and overcome complex healthcare needs
 PWID with OUD in Ukraine, we conducted a multi-site, prospective trial to compare QHIs
 for PWID with OUD randomized to receive OAT in SATC or PCCs. Participants randomized
 to receive OAT at PCC then selected (blinded to status) a clinic that had been randomized to
 P4P or no P4P for physicians throughout regions of Ukraine.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Ethics statement
 
<section> This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at Yale University
 and Ukrainian Institute on Public Health Policy. All participants provided written informed
 consent with a release of medical information for chart surveys, which are part of the parent
 trial.
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> A randomized controlled trial is now underway to compare outcomes between OAT deliv-
 ered in SATC versus delivery in PCC with P4P or without P4P for physicians. The study
 design is outlined in 
<section> Figs 1 and 2A. This interim analysis was conducted as part of the data
 safety and monitoring plan recommendations to assess self-reported outcomes; the main
 outcome for the parent trial is objective QHIs obtained through chart review. The main trial
 involves 12 regions, but due to delays in rolling out regions in sequential phases, prelimi-
 nary 12-month data are examined for only 9 regions of Ukraine: Cherkasy, Dnipro, Krama-
 torsk, Kropyvnytskyi, Kryvyi Rih, Mariupol, Mykolaiv, Rivne, and Zhytomyr. To account
 for geographical variation, participants in each region were distributed among one of three
 groups: SATC, PCC with P4P, and PCC without P4P as indicated in 
<section> Fig 2B. Each of the
 sites aimed to enroll half of their participants from patients who were already stable on
 OAT (OAT established) and the other half from patients newly enrolling onto OAT (OAT
 naïve). Each region was phased into the trial at four start-up times to allow for adequate
 allocation of resources and research personnel. The study was registered with clinicaltrials.
 gov after enrollment began due to changes in staffing near the beginning of the study caus-
 ing a delay in registration.
 
<section> Participants
 
<section> People seeking care or already receiving care at SATCs were approached for the study. Eligibil-
 ity criteria included age 18 years or older, meeting ICD-10 criteria for opioid dependence,
 interested in or already on OAT, any past injection drug use, and residing within the legal
 catchment district to receive primary care. Exclusion criteria included being under police
 investigation, planning on moving to a new area, inability to provide informed consent, and
 inability to understand Ukrainian or Russian fluently.

<section> Randomization
 
<section> We utilized permuted block randomization with variable block sizes to randomize eligible
 participants 1:2 to SATC or PCC using a computerized randomization module in REDCap
 [27]. Enrolled participants were stratified based on whether they were stable on OAT (3
 months or more in treatment) or newly starting OAT. Those randomized to PCCs could
 choose their preferred PCC (often choosing one closest to their home) but were blinded to
 the P4P status of the PCC. P4P status was randomly assigned to one of the two participating
 PCCs within a local geographic region. Research assistants oversaw enrollment activities,
 and the data manager oversaw participant randomization using REDCap [27] and informed
 the research assistants.

<section> Study sites and intervention
 
<section> After enrollment, research assistants advised all participants to seek primary care services, irre-
 spective of their randomization. Participants randomized to PCC then chose one of the two
 PCCs (PCC with P4P or PCC without P4P) in their region, blinded to the P4P status. Those
 randomized to SATC, the current standard of care in Ukraine, continued to receive OAT ser-
 vices at their respective SATC and primary care services at the one in their district, with no
 other intervention imposed aside from structured surveys. Those randomized to receive OAT
 in PCCs, irrespective of P4P incentives, received care at PCCs where the clinical staff com-
 pleted two 3-day training courses. The first course focused on regulations regarding OAT and
 basic training on how to manage OAT, HIV and TB. Staff were also oriented to how to effec-
 tively use ECHO-Integrated Care (ECHO-IC), which would provide more advanced and
 ongoing training and clinical support on management of HIV, OAT, and TB in a primary care
 setting. The second 3-day training course focused on quality improvement (QI) strategies. Fol-
 lowing this, each PCC continued to participate in weekly ECHO-IC sessions that consisted of
 clinical didactic and case presentations along with QI strategies focused on topics surrounding
 care for PWID. Clinicians at PCC with P4P were also informed that they could earn a mone-
 tary monthly bonus depending on the number of QHIs completed by their patients.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> For this preliminary analysis we collected self-reported surveys from participants at six and
 twelve months about their healthcare utilization at any location in the previous six months, 
<section> Fig 3. A review of primary

<section> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0000344.g003
 
<section> specifically focusing on pre-determined QHIs. The QHI survey included questions such as
 “Have you had a medical examination completed in the past six months?” Additional informa-
 tion about demographics, HIV, HCV, and TB was obtained via survey at baseline and each fol-
 lowing interview. Technical information such as name and date of birth was collected directly
 by the interviewer, who was blinded to P4P status but not PCC vs SATC status, and the rest of
 the survey including QHI outcome data was self-administered with the interviewer in the room
 to answer any questions the participant had. Reasons for early withdrawal from the study were
 collected via phone interviews with the participant or a personal contact (friend/relative); a list
 of contacts was provided by each participant at the beginning of the trial to be used in case of
 inability to contact the participant. All data were collected and managed via RedCAP [27].
 QHIs were developed using Ukraine Ministry of Health guidelines and a group of national
 and international experts who finalized the QHIs using the Delphi method; all QHIs used in
 this analysis are in accordance with the current national clinical guidelines in Ukraine [28, 29].
 Some services are recommended to be completed bi-annually, annually, or less frequently;
 however, for each study participant, one completed QHI in the twelve month period of the
 study satisfied the requirements to be included in the composite QHI score used for analysis.
 The final selected QHIs for the study are summarized in 
<section> Fig 3. Some QHIs were only indicated
 for patients based on their age, sex (e.g., mammography), TB or HIV status (Fig 3). The com-
 pletion of recommended services for individuals was summarized as a QHI score (QHI score
 = [number of services completed/number of services recommended)] x 100%). The composite
 QHI score (mean QHI score including all services) was the primary outcome for this analysis.
 Secondary outcomes included QHI subgroups, specifically for primary care (mean QHI score
 including only primary care services) and specialty treatment QHIs score (mean QHI score
 including only OAT, HIV and TB services).
 The primary outcome of the parent trial is verified QHIs from patient clinical records at the
 end of 24 months; the primary outcome for this preliminary analysis is self-reported at the end

<section> of 12-months. These preliminary self-reported findings were presented to an independent
 Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) as part of an interim analysis that included two
 and one Ukrainian expert. These findings, along with the observation of no major harms
 observed, resulted in the DSMB to recommend study continuation since the findings did not
 meet futility criteria.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> Analyses were performed using STATA SE 15 [30], R v.4.0X [31], and SAS 9.4 [32]. Power cal-
 culations for the primary outcome of the parent trial, showed a sample size of 405 per group
 (total sample size of 1215) was needed to have 90% power at a 5% level of significance to detect
 a standardized effect size of 0.10 for a null of no difference between the means of the three
 groups versus an alternative of at least one difference at the 24-month time point. A final sam-
 ple size of 1350, after inflation by 10% for potential loss to follow-up at 24 months, was deemed
 necessary to have 90% power with a 2.5% type I error rate (Bonferonni corrected) to detect a
 standardized effect size of 0.16 within each of the OAT strata (new versus experienced).
 A linear mixed model was used (after verification of model assumptions) to estimate the
 least squares mean QHI for SATC compared to PCC treatment group, OAT status groups, and
 P4P groups adjusting for region as a random effect. Pairwise comparisons were used to deter-
 mine mean differences between QHI scores for each group. To assess the impact of missing
 data, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using an extreme allocation value single imputation
 method. To bias against our hypothesis, patients at integrated care settings will have higher
 QHI than those treated at addiction specialty settings, we assigned all patients with missing
 outcome data in integrated care a QHI score of 0 (the lowest possible) and those in addiction
 specialty a QHI score of 100 (the highest possible).
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Enrollment and data collection for 1459 participants occurred from January 20, 2018 to
 November 1, 2020 (Fig 1) in 9 regions of Ukraine. Of the 990 patients randomized, all were
 receiving (n = 602) or newly initiating methadone (n = 388). The sample size in our initial
 power calculation for the final endpoint was not yet reached for this preliminary analysis. Of
 the randomized participants, 84 did not complete the baseline survey mainly due to with-
 drawal of consent, and 95 were missing either 6-month or 12-month surveys with the main
 reasons being death, inability to reach the participant, or arrest/incarceration. Of the 84 partic-
 ipants that did not complete the baseline survey, there was a higher proportion of missed base-
 line surveys in the PCC without P4P group (n = 42) which was mainly due to one site, Kryvyi
 Rih, where deviation from the protocol led to early withdrawal by participants. This was reme-
 diated early in the study. Of the 95 participants that missed either 6-month or 12-month sur-
 veys, the number of participants lost to follow up did not significantly differ between the three
 groups. Participants with missing data due to death were more likely to have needed treatment
 for TB treatment or more likely to have HIV. Cause of death for several of the individuals was
 TB or HIV and is the likely reason for this correlation. Additionally, sensitivity analysis with
 extreme values (0) imputed for the QHI scores in PCC with P4P and PCC without P4P in all
 missing surveys did not change the conclusion of the primary analysis. Due to the results of
 these sensitivity analyses, participants with missing 6-month or 12-month data were omitted
 from the analysis. A total of 172 (17.4%) participants were omitted from the final analysis due
 to incomplete data (missing baseline, 6-month, or 12-month surveys).
 The characteristics of the 906 participants with completed baseline information (Table 1)
 were similar between the PCC and SACT groups with participants being on average 40.2 years

 ence is observed for the secondary analysis of the primary care QHI score where PCC was 18.4
 (95% CI: 14.8–22.0; p<0.001) percentage points higher compared to SATC. A smaller yet sta-
 tistically significant difference is seen for the specialty care (OAT/HIV/TB) QHI score which
 was on average 5.9 (95% CI: 2.6–9.2; p<0.001) percentage points higher in PCC compared to
 SATC. For all three QHI scores, no statistically significant differences were observed between
 the two PCC groups (PCC without P4P and PCC with P4P).

<section> Despite international recommendations to integrate and expand primary care for PWID,
 there have been few empiric evaluations of its effects on clinical outcomes, especially regarding
 more comprehensive health outcomes. To fill this gap, we review interim self-report data from
 a prospective randomized trial to assess integration of OAT into PCCs using ECHO-IC facili-
 tation to ensure that primary care clinicians have the skills necessary to provide specialty care
 services. Important among these findings is that PWID who are treated with OAT at PCCs
 with ECHO-informed support obtained significantly more comprehensive care, measured as
 composite QHI scores, than those treated with OAT at SAT clinics–the current standard of
 care. These composite QHI score improvements achieved for patients at PCCs were driven
 independently by both the additional primary care services provided, measured as primary
 care QHIs, but also by specialty (OAT, HIV, TB) service QHIs. Importantly, the specialty care
 QHIs which included addiction treatment services, were at least as good in primary care as in
 SAT settings suggesting that primary care providers with support from ECHO-IC can manage
 not only the addiction specialty conditions, but potentially other infectious diseases like HIV
 and TB for which providers received additional support. Of note, however, low levels of TB
 indicators in all treatment groups suggest that there may be additional barriers to providing
 this service that are not addressed with ECHO-IC. One potential explanation is that the pri-
 mary care doctors do not have routine access to tools and funding to better manage TB [33],

 Ukraine that provides independent payments for this service.
 Improved comprehensive care for people with substance use disorders are important
 because previous research has shown that these individuals have a higher mortality, largely
 from chronic diseases that can be screened for and treated in primary care settings [9–11].
 Though this study does not make the link between healthcare delivered and mortality, the
 access to primary care for PWID suggests that there might be downstream benefits from the
 additional screening and treatment that can be provided in primary care settings. Longer stud-
 ies will be needed to examine downstream effects.
 Integrated models for people with substance use disorder have previously demonstrated
 improvement in addiction related outcomes and infectious disease treatments [13, 34, 35], 
<section> however, few studies demonstrate the effect of integration of services on primary care out-
 comes [26, 36–38]. One study that included primary care measures such as hypertension and
 sexually transmitted infections showed highly improved treatment completion when services
 were provided on-site compared to off-site referral [38]. Another study, however, showed that
 co-location of addiction and primary care services resulted in markedly lower levels of addic-
 tion severity, but did not influence the combined outcome of perceived health, functional limi-
 tations, and self-perceived severity of any physical co-morbid medical conditions [39]. While
 standardized QHIs have been recommended to assess quality of health [25], only one previous
 study utilized primary care QHIs to demonstrate improved QHI completion when OAT was
 prescribed by primary care providers compared to specialty providers [26, 37]. Information
 from prior studies along with our interim analysis seems to suggest that co-located services
 have several benefits, however longer term investigations may be needed to analyze the link
 between primary care for people with substance use disorders and disability, hospitalization
 mortality. Increased engagement between patients and the healthcare system may result in
 other positive outcomes including increased patient satisfaction, convenience, and reduced
 stigma [12, 17, 40]. Consequently, integrated or even co-located services are crucial to provide
 health equity for PWID to bridge the gap in health service delivery.
 In our preliminary results, patients newly initiating OAT compared to patients stable on
 OAT for longer than 3 months had significantly lower comprehensive QHI scores. This indi-
 cates that there may patient-level or provider-lever factors that may impact the care that is
 received by patients who are newly entering substance use treatment programs. One potential
 explanation is that patients that are newly being inducted onto OAT require considerable time
 initially to focus on addressing addiction-related issues and only when patients are stabilized,
 can other secondary health-related issues be addressed. In the parent study, chart review can
 disentangle the timing of QHIs achieved and at the end of 24 months, these indicators may
 achieve parity.
 Surprisingly, there was no statistically significant incremental benefit observed in QHIs for
 patients treated in PCCs with P4P incentives, although trends were in the direction of P4P. In
 a setting like Ukraine where physicians earn extraordinarily low salaries, we expected signifi-
 cantly higher QHIs for those with incentives, relative to those without them [22]. Despite dis-
 cussions with primary care clinicians before the study, the incentive structure may not have
 been suitable for this setting. For example, incremental increases in payment, failure to incor-
 porate loss aversion theory into the P4P incentive structure, or payments being too infrequent
 could have explained its seemingly lack of benefit [41]. Though generally P4P strategies are a
 key recommendation in aiding the expansion of services and improved care at PCCs [15, 22],
 most studies show mixed outcomes [42]. Qualitative studies are needed to further explore
 these findings and to guide improvements in incentives for primary care physicians in
 Ukraine.
 Despite these early findings that suggest that integrating OAT into PCCs can substantially
 improve the comprehensiveness of care delivered to PWID with OUD, there are several limita-
 tions. This study represents an interim analysis, and final reports should include all study sites,
 follow participants over a complete 24 months, and include verified data from the patient med-
 ical record. Verified data are crucial to reduce any social desirability bias and recall bias which
 can be present with self-reported data, although we see no reason to believe that the recall
 would be differential between the groups and bias our estimates, and it is important to observe
 outcomes over a longer time-period as there are some services for which patients may not
 need on annual basis. Additionally, the level of clinical significance of the QHI score reported
 in this manuscript is difficult to ascertain. While a 12-percentage point difference in QHI
 score could mean 1–2 more healthcare services obtained by a patient, those services may be 
<section> treatment or a urine analysis which may hold different weight for the patient’s overall health.
 QHI scores may be more clinically meaningful if the services were weighed based on level of
 importance which is difficult to determine and varies on an individual basis. With these limita-
 tions in mind, it is equally important to report on these preliminary findings as they show
 promising beneficial impact on the health of PWID, and these results can begin guiding the
 expansion of OAT in resource limited settings.
 Additional limitations for this preliminary analysis include: (a) The study was not powered
 for this preliminary look at the 12-month self-report data. Thus, in light of not having a clear
 definition of clinical significance and the difference between P4P groups not reaching statisti-
 cal significance, it makes those differences difficult to interpret; however, differences in QHI
 scores between SATC and PCC were significant, indicating the strong positive effect of the
 intervention; (b) Although we are observing a strong effect size in the self-report data, the
 effect size may not be an accurate reflection of the final effect size in the full sample for the
 12-month self-report data or at the final 24-month endpoint, which will be based on chart
 review; [43, 44] (c) While recommended QHI completion frequency is variable (semi- to bi-
 annually), we limited our QHI achievement to only if it had been done in the past year, poten-
 tially leading to over or under-recording of scores. The QHIs observed in this study encompass
 a comprehensive array of services, but the composite QHI score does not account for the vari-
 able importance of completing some QHIs compared to others; and (d), we excluded individu-
 als without complete data and while our conclusions did not change after conducting extreme
 value imputation, there is potential for these results to have been biased. Nevertheless, these
 findings provide preliminary but important insights into understanding integration of OAT
 into PCCs in Ukraine.
