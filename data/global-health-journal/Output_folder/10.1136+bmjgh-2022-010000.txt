<section> WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 
<section> ⇒ Kangaroo mother care initiated in community set-
 tings (ciKMC) reduces neonatal and early infant mor-
 tality among low birthweight babies.
 
<section> ⇒ Evidence is lacking on the impact of ciKMC on finan-
 cial risk protection for households.
 
<section> WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
 
<section> ⇒ This is the first study to assess the impact of kan-
 garoo mother care on healthcare out of pocket ex-
 penditure, catastrophic healthcare expenditure and
 impoverishment of household due to healthcare
 seeking for low birthweight infants.
 
<section> ⇒ We show that ciKMC can substantially reduce the
 cost of care seeking and the risk of impoverishment
 for households.
 
<section> HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH,
 
<section> PRACTICE OR POLICY
 
<section> ⇒ Our findings support the inclusion and scale-­up of
 kangaroo mother care in communities with high
 burden of low birth weight.

<section> and middle-­ i ncome countries (LMICs).
 Interventions which can reduce avoid-
 able mortality exist, however, coverage
 and quality for such interventions remain
 modest in many LMICs. 2 Earlier, we have
 shown that kangaroo mother care initi-
 ated in community settings (community
 initiated KMC or ciKMC) can substantially
 reduce early infant mortality (HR 0.75,
 95% CI 0.60 to 0.93, p=0.01) and has bene-
 ficial equity impact. 3 4 Poverty is a major
 barrier in accessing healthcare in LMICs. 
<section> Clinicians often find it difficult to provide optimal
 care due to financial constraints in the households.
 Disease and healthcare seeking may plunge a family
 into poverty since much of health budgets in LMICs are
 funded by direct out-­o f-­pocket expenditure (OOPE).
 High-­ q uality evidence on interventions which can
 prevent impoverishment are needed. Health benefits
 should be supplemented with social welfare outcomes
 in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of healthcare
 interventions.
 The RCT methodology is ideal for assessing the
 impact of healthcare on household economy. Still
 few, if any, RCTs have used impoverishment and
 catastrophic healthcare expenditure (CHE) as study
 outcomes to assess the impact of interventions on
 financial risk protection. 7 Modelling studies have
 indicated that some health interventions provide dual
 benefits in reducing disease incidence and disease
 severity, which results in fewer healthcare visits and
 thereby reduced costs for families. 8 9 An RCT design
 could be used to provide direct evidence for the
 extent to which an intervention can provide financial
 risk protection in addition to health benefits.
 In 2019, India accounted for approximately one-­
 fourth of all neonatal deaths globally. 10 In 2020,
 the health expenditure in India was estimated to be
 US$73 per capita, of which 65% were OOPE, a regres-
 sive method of health financing. 11 Healthcare seeking
 in India, therefore, imposes a substantial financial
 cost for households. Each year, between 14% and 44%
 of households in India experience CHE, defined as
 healthcare OOPE above a specified level of the total
 household expenditure (THE) (typically 10%) and
 around 5% of households become impoverished. 12
 High OOPE for care seeking of sick infants is a major
 barrier to accessing healthcare, especially among
 poor families. 13–15 Health systems should ensure that
 people have access to services which improve health
 but without detrimental impact on other aspects of
 well-­ b eing. Financial risk protection is an integral
 component of universal health coverage and an
 important health policy goal. CHE and impoverish-
 ment due to healthcare seeking, which are measures
 of financial risk, are indicators for monitoring
 sustainable development goals targets. 11 Protection
 from financial hardships can be ensured through a
 well-­ f unctioning social health insurance or by tax-­
 financed health systems. 16 However, such health
 financing mechanisms are currently not available in
 most resource constrained settings. 7 Hence, assessing
 the financial risk protection from standard health-
 care interventions is particularly important in coun-
 tries with poorly functioning welfare systems.
 To our knowledge, this is the first RCT which directly
 assesses the impact of a health intervention on financial
 risk protection. More specifically, we evaluated the effect
 of ciKMC on healthcare OOPE, the risk of CHE and
 impoverishment during the first half of infancy, among
 low birthweight (LBW) infants in the Indian state of
 Haryana.
 
<section> METHODS
 Study design, setting and participants
 This unmasked, parallel arm individually randomised
 superiority trial was a preplanned substudy of a
 randomised trial, which extended data capture, enabling
 the assessment of the impact of ciKMC on financial risk
 protection. 3 The trial was undertaken to estimate the
 effect of ciKMC on postenrolment neonatal and early
 infant mortality among infants who weighed between
 1500 and 2250 g within 72 hours after birth. 3 It was
 conducted in rural and semiurban, low-­income popu-
 lations of Faridabad and Palwal districts in the state of
 Haryana, India from July 2015 to October 2018. 3 17 In the
 substudy, which collected data on healthcare expendi-
 tures and household consumption, infants were enrolled
 from September 2017 to October 2018.
 A written individual informed consent was obtained
 prior to enrolment. The consent form was translated
 into the local language and administered by a trained
 interviewer. For those unable to read, it was read out by
 the worker administering consent. In those unable to
 sign, a thumb imprint witnessed and countersigned by
 an impartial literate witness was taken. We ensured equi-
 table authorship in the publication (online supplemental
 appendix S1 – Reflexivity Statement).
 
<section> Patient and public involvement
 In the formative research conducted prior to trial initia-
 tion, qualitative research methods such as in-­depth inter-
 views, focus group discussions and observations were
 used to ascertain practices around birth and to assess the
 feasibility and acceptability of ciKMC. A prototype inter-
 vention package and delivery strategy were designed, and
 household trials were conducted to ascertain adoption
 rates among mothers of LBW babies.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 We randomly assigned LBW infants to either the ciKMC
 arm or the control arm in the trial. Infants from the
 same household were allocated to the ciKMC arm if a
 previously enrolled infant from the household had been
 allocated to the ciKMC arm; otherwise, assignment was
 done as per the randomisation sequence. The sequence
 was prepared by an independent statistician not involved
 with other trial activities using random permuted blocks
 of variable size. Detailed methods of the ciKMC trial have
 been published earlier. 3
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> The intervention was promotion of and support for
 KMC defined as prolonged skin-­to-­skin contact between
 neonates and their mothers or surrogates for as long as
 possible during the day and night, and exclusive breast
 feeding. An intervention delivery team made nine home
 visits in the ciKMC arm to initiate, promote and support

<section> KMC during the first 28 days of life. During the visits, the
 worker observed the mother practising KMC, enquired
 about skin-­ to-­ skin contact and breast feeding in the
 preceding 24-­ hour period and supported the mother
 and family to solve any problems or overcome barriers to
 effective KMC. No intervention was given to the control
 families but families in both the ciKMC and control arms
 of the trial continued to receive routine home-­based care
 from the public health system.
 Due to the nature of the intervention, mothers were
 not masked to allocation; however, efforts were made
 to keep the independent outcome assessors unaware
 of the intervention allocation and the study hypoth-
 esis. We collected information on socioeconomic and
 demographic variables for the household, mother, and
 father of the study infant as well as on different goods
 and services consumed by the members of the house-
 hold during enrolment (table 1). Household consump-
 tion of goods and services is an important reflection of
 economic well-­being and thereby of living standards. For
 infants who had received medical attention, information
 on healthcare OOPE related to each event of outpatient
 and inpatient care seeking were collected at the 28-­day,
 90-­day and 180-­day visits (table 1). A limited number of
 expenditure items were included in the questionnaire
 and the recall period was 4 weeks for the visit on 28th day
 of life and 2 weeks for visits on 90th and 180th day of life.
 
<section> BMJ Global Health
 
<section> The short recall period was intended to improve accuracy,
 as recommended in surveys on household economy.
 
<section> Study outcomes
 The primary outcomes of the study were healthcare
 OOPE, CHE and impoverishment of the household due
 to healthcare expenditure for the study infant. Secondary
 outcomes were THE, household healthcare OOPE for an
 episode of non-­severe (ie, outpatient care) or severe (ie,
 in-­patient care) illness and healthcare utilisation.
 All the costs associated with care seeking during each
 visit (table 1) to a healthcare provider were considered
 an event of care seeking. Hence, a single episode of
 illness could lead to multiple events of care seeking if
 care was sought from different care providers or from a
 single provider multiple time. Financial risk protection
 was measured in two ways. The first considered the risk
 of falling below the national poverty line due to health-
 care OOPE for households which were above the poverty
 line at baseline, and the second considered the risk of
 experiencing CHE from enrolment till 6 months of
 infant age. Healthcare expenditures were considered to
 be catastrophic at three different levels: ≥10% of THE,
 
<section> ≥25% of THE and ≥40% of the non-­food expenditures
 as suggested by the World Bank and WHO. 19 We also
 assessed the distribution of gross THE, and net household
 expenditure in the study arms. Net household expendi-
 ture was calculated by subtracting healthcare OOPE from
 THE. Because we only had data on healthcare expen-
 ditures for eight out of the 26 weeks of follow-­up, total
 household consumption was calculated for a duration of
 8 weeks, based on the items listed in table 1. We used the
 Indian urban threshold of US$0.72 per capita per day in
 total household consumption to calculate the number of
 people falling below the poverty line.
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> Literature suggests that CHE for different health condi-
 tions in India range between 14% and 44% and these esti-
 mates are sensitive to the source of care seeking (public
 vs private and inpatient vs outpatient). 21 Data specific to
 CHE for healthcare seeking among families with LBW
 infants less than 6 months of age for the study setting was
 unavailable. Since we included both public and private
 sources of care seeking and included both inpatient and
 outpatient care seeking, we used a conservative CHE esti-
 mate of 15% for our control arm. 15 To be able to esti-
 mate a minimum 25% relative risk reduction in CHE with
 ciKMC promotion and support, with a two-­sided alpha
 of 0.05 and 90% power, we needed a minimum sample
 size of 1702 infants in each trial arm. We used a two-­
 proportion test for calculating the sample size using the
 above assumptions. 22 However, because the background
 CHE estimate was conservative and to enhance statis-
 tical precision of our estimates, we continued to enrol
 participants until the enrolment in the primary trial was
 completed. 
<insert> Figure 1 Trial profile. Note: The data safety and monitoring board stopped the trial before the last enrolled child could
 complete 180 days follow-­up. Hence, at the time the trial ended, we missed eight weeks of information on care seeking
 expenditures if the child was younger than 28 days, 4 weeks if the child was younger than 90 days, and 2 weeks if the child age
 was younger than 180 days old. ciKMC, Kangaroo Mother Care initiated in community setting.

<section> Statistical analysis
 We used Stata V.16.1 (StataCorp) and R statistical environ-
 ment for all analyses. We summarised baseline character-
 istics using percentages, means with SD and median with
 IQR. We show the distribution of THE and net house-
 hold expenditure in a Pen’s parade, which is generally
 used to show the income distribution in a population.
 We used generalised linear models of the Gaussian family
 with an identity link to estimate the mean difference with
 95% CIs in healthcare OOPE. We calculated the effect of
 ciKMC promotion and support on CHE and impoverish-
 ment due to care seeking using Cox regression models to
 estimate HRs with 95% CIs. We used robust SEs to account
 for clustering due to more than one infant within a single
 household. 23 Estimates for inpatient, outpatient and total
 costs were generated separately for all infants as well as
 for the infants who had at least one event of care seeking.
 Costs are reported in 2017 US$, with a conversion rate
 US$1=INR65.12.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Between September 2017 and Oct 2018, 4475 infants
 were enrolled into the study. The infants were randomly
 assigned to either the ciKMC (n=2491) or control
 (n=1984) arm (figure 1). Table 2 shows the baseline char-
 acteristics of the infants, their mothers and their families.
 Randomisation effectively balanced important baseline
 characteristics of the study participants.
 Tables 3 and 4 show the impact of ciKMC on health-
 care OOPE, and the HR of CHE and impoverishment of
 families due to care seeking for study infants. During the
 8 weeks when patient cost data were available, the average
 healthcare OOPE was US$5.54 (95% CI −11.38 to 0.30)
 lower in the ciKMC arm compared with the control arm.
 The percentage of households experiencing CHE was
 high during the first 180 days of life, ranging between
 4.7% and 7.9% in the control arm and between 3.7% and
 7.2% in the intervention arm at different cut-­offs. The
 risk of CHE was only 9% (HR 0.91) to 21% (HR 0.79)
 lower in the ciKMC arm as compared with the control
 arm for the different cut-­offs used. ciKMC promotion
 and support caused a reduction in the risk of impoverish-
 ment due to healthcare expenditures of 44% (HR 0.56;
 95% CI 0.36 to 0.89).
 Figure 2 shows the distribution of THE and the net
 of healthcare OOPE, which was derived by subtracting
 healthcare OOPE (drop lines) from THE in the two trial
 arms. The plot shows participants ranked based on THE
 and the net of healthcare OOPE through droplines.

<section> closer to poverty line, have higher risks of impoverish-
 ment or being further pushed into poverty due to health-
 care seeking. Note that we see from figure 2 that some
 households have extremely high healthcare OOPE (seen
 by the long drop lines). These high expenses were more
 common among those seeking inpatient care and are
 presented in greater detail in table
 As seen in table 5, the average number of out-­patient
 care seeking events per infant was 0.07 or 9% (0.07/0.74)
 lower in the ciKMC arm than the control arm, whereas
 the number of inpatient care-­seeking episodes per infant
 were similar. Importantly, families in the ciKMC arm
 sought care 3.5 hours earlier compared with the fami-
 lies in the control arm. The families who sought inpa-
 tient care spent an average of US$79 in the ciKMC as
 compared with US$106 in the control arm, suggesting
 that ciKMC induced a US$27 or 25% (26.9/106.0) reduc-
 tion in inpatient cost per infant.
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> In the current analysis, we showed that supporting
 mothers of LBW infants (1500–2250 g) to provide ciKMC
 had two important financial benefits to households:
 reduced risk of impoverishment due to care seeking for
 the infant and reduction in healthcare OOPE, especially
 for inpatient visits. Although estimated with limited statis-
 tical precision, the risk of catastrophic healthcare OOPE

<section> tended to be lower in the ciKMC arm at all thresholds
 examined.
 Healthcare OOPE for study infants seeking inpatient
 care were 25% lower in the intervention group leading to
 considerable savings of family resources. This translates
 to a 12% increase in the median household consumption
 of US$228 that could be used to meet other household
 needs. ciKMC also protected families of study infants from
 the risk of impoverishment due to healthcare OOPE.
 This is particularly important in settings like India where
 coverage of public health insurance is low and around
 65% of all total healthcare is financed through OOPE.
 Results from this RCT, therefore, provides important
 economic arguments for strengthening KMC to LBW
 infants in India and similar settings.
 Financial risk protection of healthcare programmes
 and interventions have so far been assessed in model-
 ling studies or data from cross-­ sectional and cohort
 studies. 9 25–28 This study demonstrates, for the first time,
 that individual-­level data from an RCT can be used to
 estimate the financial risk protection of an intervention.
 An RCT provides an excellent platform for including
 non-­ health outcomes in addition to the traditional
 clinical endpoints as the estimates are less likely to be
 unbiased. 29 30 The true benefit of an intervention is best
 estimated when both health and non-­health outcomes
 are taken into consideration. Using RCT methodology
 to provide better assessment of financial risk protection
 is relevant when assessing health technologies targeting
 conditions with high financial risk. Such RCTs may aid
 policy makers in assigning weight to poverty reduc-
 tion and financial risk protection when setting priority
 between various health interventions for inclusion in
 national programmes and benefit packages. 31
 Household cost savings due to ciKMC, especially for
 vulnerable households at risk of outright poverty, can
 be attributed to several factors. We found that ciKMC
 reduced the number of illness episodes for which care
 was sought and led to early care seeking. These are
 particularly relevant for understanding how ciKMC
 reduces household healthcare expenses. The progres-
 sion of illness is much faster in early life, especially
 among infants. Illness is also likely to be less severe in
 the early stages. Prompt care seeking for illness, as seen
 in the ciKMC arm, can therefore have both a survival
 and a cost reducing effect, especially by reducing
 the risk of hospitalisation. ciKMC has been shown to
 reduce neonatal and early infant mortality. 3 Our anal-
 yses showed additional non-­health benefits in the form
 of reduced healthcare OOPE and lower risk of impov-
 erishment, further supporting the inclusion of ciKMC
 in the national health programme in India.
 Globally, there are few healthcare interventions that
 provide as much health benefits per US$ invested as
 KMC initiated in hospital settings. 33 34 Ruiz et al, reported
 that baseline case incremental cost utility ratio as cost
 saving (−US$1546), showing that KMC was dominant
 that is, less expensive, and more effective than standard
 care, and it was far below the willingness to pay threshold
 for Columbia. 34 Lowson et al, concluded that the benefit
 to cost ratio of KMC ranged between 7.4:1 and 21.7:1 that
 is, the net return on investment was positive.
 Our findings should be interpreted considering
 the following strengths. We collected detailed data

 on the cost of care seeking including inpatient and
 outpatient costs. Data on household consumption was
 collected using a limited number of different items in
 the questionnaire and short recall periods to ensure
 better data quality. The large sample size, balanced
 randomisation and negligible lost to follow-­ up indi-
 cate a well-­conducted RCT. Our estimates of household
 
<section> BMJ Global Health
 
<section> consumption are similar to previous estimates from the
 study setting. 35 Nonetheless, our study suffers from the
 limitation that we only collected data for 8 out of the
 26 weeks of follow-­up. Assuming that the care-­seeking
 patterns and associated costs for the 26-­week follow-­up
 period were similar to the 8-­week sampling period, the
 actual savings would be higher than our estimates. Due 
<section> to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to
 mask mothers to allocation of the intervention.
 
<section> CONCLUSION
 ciKMC can substantially reduce the cost of care seeking
 and the risk of impoverishment for households. Our
 findings show that supporting mothers at home to
 provide KMC to LBW infants may, in addition to
 enhancing infant survival, provide financial risk protec-
 tion.
