 non-abstinent smokers:
 randomised controlled trial
 
<section> Background Emerging evidence supports the efficacy of mobile phone interven-
 tions for smoking cessation. However, behaviour changes of smokers who fail to
 reach abstinence and the related psychological mechanism are still understudied.
 We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a behaviour change theory-based smoking
 cessation intervention delivered through personalised text messages from the per-
 spective of smokers who fail to reach abstinence.
 
<section> Methods We conducted a two-arm, double-blind, randomised controlled trial,
 with the intervention group receiving personalised text messages developed spe-
 cifically for this study, and the control group receiving non-personalised ones
 related to smoking cessation. These messages were sent over a period of three
 months. We looked at three outcomes: changes in smoking frequency, in smoking
 amount, and in protection motivation theory (PMT) construct scores.
 
<section> Results We obtained smoking cessation results for 722 participants who went
 through the randomisation process (intervention: 360, control: 362; block ran-
 domisation design). Overall, 32.3% of baseline daily smokers in the intervention
 group and 20.0% in the control group changed to weekly smokers during the fol-
 low-up period (P < 0.001), while 43.4% of consistent daily smokers in the inter-
 vention group and 32.8% in the control group continuously reduced their smok-
 ing amount (P < 0.001). We observed associations between the intrinsic rewards
 of smoking and changes from daily to weekly smoking, the perceived severity of
 smoking and reductions in smoking amount, as well as the self-efficacy of quit-
 ting and changes from daily to weekly smoking/reductions in smoking amount.
 
<section> Conclusions We found that a personalised text message-based intervention was
 more likely to decrease the frequency and amount of smoking in smokers who
 failed to reach abstinence compared to a non-personalised one. We also explored
 the possible psychological mechanism of such positive effects. Here we provide
 evidence for countries to consider the promotion of smoking cessations using be-
 haviour theory-driven personalised text messages, which may be more cost-effec-
 tive than traditional approaches.

 Studies have shown that mobile cessation programs can encourage smokers to quit
 smoking and are affordable even in resource-poor settings, but have mostly focused
 on showing the framework of an intervention and reporting how many smokers reach
 abstinence (normally the three- or six-month sustained abstinence rate) [1-3]. Other
 components, i.e. the behaviour change of smokers who fail to reach abstinence and
 the related psychological mechanism, are still understudied. 
<section> As even the most effective treatments help just one in four smokers quit in the long-term, and as mobile
 cessation may have a much lower quitting rate than pharmacotherapy, exclusively measuring the quitting
 rate is insufficient [4]. Therefore, we believe it necessary to investigate the change in smokers who fail to
 reach abstinence and the psychological determinants of positive change in order to comprehensively eval-
 uate mobile cessation efficacy and provide insight into how to use minimal interventions to achieve max-
 imum effects.
 
<section> Until recently, the psychological mechanism of promoting quitting behaviour using mobile health inter-
 ventions have been explored by only a few studies [5,6], with most finding some psychological determi-
 nants of abstinence. For example, a personalised text message program found that the intrinsic reward of
 smoking and self-efficacy of quitting were significantly associated with quitting [5]. However, the positive
 behavioural changes and determinants of success at different reduction stages of smokers who fail to reach
 abstinence remain under-researched. One dimension of such behavioural changes is the continuous re-
 duction in smoking amount, which is especially valuable in less intensive smoking cessation interventions,
 
<section> such as text message-based ones
 
<section> Individuals are usually advised to quit smoking abruptly on a designated “quit” day [7,8]; however, a Co-
 chrane review published in 2019 found that reducing smoking behaviour prior to quitting could also be vi-
 able [9]. Therefore, we believe that a stable reduction in the number of cigarettes post-intervention could be
 a meaningful indicator for measuring the effects of a mobile cessation intervention, particularly for smok-
 ers who fail to reach abstinence.
 
<section> Reducing smoking frequency can also be a pathway of a positive change for smokers, as studies support the
 value of lengthening the time between cigarettes [9-11]. First, a shift form daily to weekly smoking reduces
 the average daily intake of nicotine, and consequently, decreases nicotine dependence. Second, a reduction
 in smoking frequency represents a step towards cessation, thereby increasing self-efficacy and the likeli-
 hood of achieving abstinence, while also providing a more achievable goal compared to complete cessation
 for some heavy smokers who use mobile cessation support. It may also help with participant retention and
 provide an opportunity to increase an individual’s motivation to quit.
 
<section> Studies have found that personalised and behaviour change theory-based interventions could be more ef-
 fective than only providing broad, non-specific advice [12,13] because self-relevant information can easily
 engage attention, increase motivation for information processing, and cause more behavioural changes [14].
 Most personalised communications are achieved through ongoing evaluation; allowing smokers to join the
 information generation process could also increase compliance. We believe that reducing smoking frequen-
 cy and amount are two important indicators of abstinence. A survey in the UK found that 40% of quitting
 attempts involved an initial cut-down in consumption [9], while data from the USA showed that nearly half
 of smokers planning to quit would choose reduction over abrupt cessation [15]. We thus hypothesised that
 a personalised text message-based intervention would more likely lead to reductions in smoking amount
 and frequency in smokers who fail to reach abstinence than a non-personalised one.
 We previously conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to address the evidence gap and comprehen-
 sively evaluate the impact of mobile cessation interventions. We found that a behaviour change theory-based
 smoking cessation intervention through personalised text messages was more effective in reducing the bio-
 chemically verified six-month sustained abstinence rate than one based on non-personalised messages (6.9%
 vs 3.0% (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-5.83)) [3].
 Here we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a behaviour change theory-based smoking cessation interven-
 tion delivered through personalised text messages from the perspective of smokers who fail to reach absti-
 nence. We focused on behaviour change, such as reducing smoking amount or frequency, of participants
 who continued smoking during the follow-up period. We also further sought to explore the psychological
 mechanism of positive change.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Study design and participants
 
<section> We conducted two-arm, double-blind, randomised controlled trial in five cities in China (Beijing, Dezhou,
 Baotou, Yakeshi, and Linzi), with participants randomised to an intervention or control group between Efficacy of text message intervention in reducing smoking frequency and amount
 
<section> We included daily or weekly smokers aged ≥18 who owned a mobile phone and used WeChat, and who
 agreed to participate by signing an informed consent form. We excluded individuals who had received any
 smoking cessation treatment within 30 days or had a diagnosis of any mental illnesses (either current or
 past).
 
<section> The Peking University registered the clinical trial (ChiCTR2100041942). We reported this study the follow-
 ing CONSORT reporting guidelines for randomised studies [16].
 
<section> Development of the intervention framework
 
<section> We based the intervention’s theoretical framework on the transtheoretical model (TTM) and protection mo-
 tivation theory (PMT). For the TTM, we used several strategies to strengthen behaviour changes and/or to
 achieve the next stage. On the pre-quit date, we sent messages related to consciousness raising, dramatic
 relief, and environmental re-evaluation to smokers with weak quitting intentions, and those related to stim-
 ulus control, self-liberation, and reinforcement management to smokers with strong quitting intentions. Af-
 ter the quit date, we sent messages on consciousness raising, dramatic relief, environmental re-evaluation
 and self-re-evaluation to smokers who had relapsed.
 
<section> All the participants also received messages by PMT related to the severity and susceptibility of smoking, in-
 trinsic and extrinsic rewards of smoking, self-efficacy and response efficacy and response cost of quitting.
 The motivational messages consisted of 14 subgroups with a total of 400 text messages. A more detailed
 framework of the text and intervention based on the TTM and PMT is reported separately [3,5,6]. The ex-
 ample of the intervention messages are presented in Table S1 in the 
<section> Online Supplementary Document.
 
<section> Intervention tool: WeChat
 
<section> WeChat is the most popular Chinese social media app, which our information technology team used to de-
 ploy the messages. The application evaluated the PMT construct score by asking questions and recording
 information; then, it automatically calculated the lower score of the sub-content that needed to be strength-
 ened. Specifically, the scale comprised 21 items using a seven-point Likert-type scale with responses ranging
 from 1 (definitely disagree) to 7 (definitely agree). Each construct subscale of PMT included three items, and
 we computed the mean of the subscale score. The TTM stage was also identified according to the smoking
 status of users. Then, WeChat issued personalised text messages according to the evaluation, as detailed else-
 where. Details on the scales and the processes are available elsewhere [11,12,17,18]. The WeChat application
 determined each smoker’s quitting intention through a five-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all likely) to
 5 (very likely) to in the likelihood that they would try to quit in the next six months [13].
 
<section> Recruitment
 
<section> We advertised the trial to smokers through paper advertising (leaflets), digital advertising (WeChat) and
 staff (teachers and leaders). Potential participants contacted the local Disease Control and Prevention Cen-
 ter to register their interest. The research assistants explained the study to each potential participant and
 preliminarily assessed his or her eligibility. All eligible smokers were told they needed to come to a place on
 a fixed date to finalize the recruitment process.
 
<section> Randomisation and blinding
 
<section> Participants were required to register through WeChat following recruitment. We used a randomised block
 design, with the participant score on the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (range = 0-10, with high-
 er scores indicating greater dependence) treated as a stratified factor [19]. The app automatically generat-
 ed two blocks based on the test score, with block 1 comprising participants with low or moderate nicotine
 dependence (score of 0-6 points) and block 2 comprising those with high nicotine dependence (score of
 points). Eligible participants were assigned to the intervention group or the control group within each block
 by simple randomisation. The WeChat system was also used to balance demographic characteristics. Ran-
 domisation was fully computerised and automated with equal allocation. The researchers and participants
 were all blinded. Our randomisation technique has been detailed elsewhere [3].
 
<section> Intervention
 
<section> Participants allocated to the intervention group received the intervention program consisting of one to two
 personalized text messages a day for three months. 
<section> Control group participants received non-personalised text message developed by the National Cancer In-
 stitute (NCI); this intervention was based on well-established cognitive-behavioural cessation approaches
 and contained 91 messages. Participants received approximately one message a day for three months. The
 text messages provided encouragement, practical advice to help maintain cessation, and information on the
 health effects of smoking. The details of the control group can be found elsewhere [14].
 
<section> Assessment
 
<section> All participants in the two groups were instructed to attend face-to-face follow-ups with research staff at
 one, three, and six months after randomisation. The outcomes were as follows:
 1. Frequency reduction – achieved when a daily smoker (at baseline) had not successfully quit according to
 the evaluation of biochemically verified six-month sustained abstinence rate, but had reduced the smok-
 ing frequency to weekly smoking and maintained that smoking frequency during the follow-up period.
 2. Smoking amount reduction – achieved when a daily smoker (at baseline) had not successfully quit ac-
 cording to the evaluation of biochemically verified six-month sustained abstinence rate, but had contin-
 uously reduced the smoking amount or reduced to a lower level and maintained the lower level during
 the follow-up period.
 3. Changes in PMT construct scores, including perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, intrinsic rewards
 of smoking, extrinsic rewards of smoking, self-efficacy of quitting, response efficacy of quitting, and re-
 sponse cost of quitting.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> We based the sample size calculation on the formula for a two-arm RCT. To achieve 80% power with a signif-
 icance level of 0.05 (two sided), we required a sample size of 280 individuals in each group. Assuming 20%
 attrition in the follow-up measurements, we set the required sample size at 672, as reported elsewhere [3].
 We used descriptive statistics to compare the baseline status between the two groups, after which we con-
 ducted an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and the Russell Standard (RS) for each group. All randomised
 subjects were included in the denominator for calculating abstinence rates, except for unavoidable loss to
 follow-up (died or moved to an untraceable address). Those who declined to be involved in subsequent data
 collection were counted as smokers [20].
 
<section> To evaluate the impact on reducing the frequency of smoking (the amount of smoking), we first excluded
 non-daily smokers at baseline and participants who reached biochemically verified six-month sustained
 abstinence. Then, we identified participants who changed smoking behaviour from daily to weekly and re-
 mained weekly smokers (who had continuously reduced the smoking amount or reduced to a lower level and
 maintained the lower level) until all the follow-up visits were completed and categorised them as “changers”.
 We used descriptive statistics and χ 2 tests to compare differences in the percentage of “changers” between
 the two groups. For PMT construct scores, we compared baseline and each follow-up time point difference
 between the two groups by t-tests.
 
<section> Finally, we used generalised estimating equations (GEEs) to estimate the psychological determinants of
 reducing the frequency of smoking and reducing the smoking amount to determine why the intervention
 group had a more positive change. In the first set of models, we set a dummy variable indicating whether the
 respondent reduced the frequency of smoking compared to the last follow-up visit (if yes = 1, otherwise = 0)
 as the dependent and the PMT construct scores as the independent variable, controlling for education level,
 living area, nicotine dependence, and monthly income. We chose an autocorrelation structure for the ma-
 trix structure and logistic regression for the model setting. In the second set of models, we changed the de-
 pendent variable to whether the respondent reduced their smoking amount compared to the last follow-up
 visit (if yes = 1, otherwise = 0). The results are presented as ORs and 95% CIs. We performed all analyses in
 SPSS, version 11.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA).
 
<section> Ethics considerations
 
<section> The Ethics Committee of Peking University Health Science Center (IRB00001052-30063) reviewed and ap-
 proved the trial. All the participants signed informed consent forms before randomisation and knew they
 could withdraw from the study at any time. All patient information was accessible only by personnel par-
 ticipating in the study. We did not provide money to participants, but provided gifts (towel, umbrella, or
 cup) if they completed one follow-up visit.

 their smoking amount (P < 0.001) (Figure 1).
 We found no statistically significant differences in any of the seven PMT con-
 struct scores between the two groups at baseline (Figure 2). However, as the
 intervention began, the intervention group had higher scores for perceived severity of smoking and re-
 sponse efficacy of quitting and lower scores for intrinsic and extrinsic rewards of smoking and response
 cost of quitting.
 In the last GEE regression (Figure 3), we estimate the psychological determinants of behaviour change. We
 found associations between the intrinsic rewards of smoking (OR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.74-0.90) and changes
 from daily to weekly smoking, the perceived severity of smoking (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.01- 1.32) and re-
 ductions in smoking amount, as well as self-efficacy of quitting and changes from daily to weekly smoking
 (OR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.14- 1.43) as well as reductions the smoking amount (OR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.06-1.25).

 ventions could provide smoking cessation support, their low quitting rate remains a challenge for expanding
 their usage to promote smoking cessation and gaining government support. Our study suggest that text mes-
 sage-based interventions can both help smokers quit and bring change those who fail to reach abstinence,
 making it suitable for countries with limited smoking cessation resources by allowing minimal expenses
 for maximum effects. We also found some psychological determinants of smoking reduction; among them,
 self-efficacy of quitting was associated with reductions in both smoking frequency and amount. This finding
 was also confirmed by other smoking cessation studies showing that self-efficacy was the most significant
 variable associated with forwards progress towards quitting [5,6]. Those identified psychological determi-
 nants could help with further development of specific intervention measures for different groups of people.
 
<section> CONCLUSIONS
 
<section> Based on a six-month evaluation, we found that a personalised text message-based intervention was more
 likely to decrease the frequency and amount of smoking in smokers who failed to reach abstinence com-
 pared to a non-personalised one. Further GEE analyses suggested the possible psychological mechanism
 of such positive effects. Our findings could help other countries that are starting to design or promote text
 message-based smoking cessation interventions.
