<section> Abstract
 
<section> The process of adjusting and becoming accustomed to hearing aids may be best facilitated
 by providing a hearing aid trial period. Globally, there are no standardised frameworks or
 regulations on the recommended hearing aid trial period. The main purpose of this study
 was to explore audiologists’ hearing aid trialing practices. A cross sectional study employed
 a quantitative, descriptive design to formulate the study. Ninety-five audiologists’ were
 recruited by means of a purposive sampling strategy. Data were collected through the use
 of an online survey via Google forms. A pilot study was conducted prior to the commence-
 ment of the main study in order to ensure reliability of the main study. The results indicated
 that two weeks was the most recommended duration of a trial period from audiologists’.
 Majority of audiologists’ (72.63%) offer hearing aid trials to their patients. Most audiologists’
 who offer hearing aid trials choose to trial their patients with two different hearing aids. Find-
 ings revealed a need for trialing periods to become standard practice by audiologists’ when
 fitting hearing aids. Not enough audiologists’ are providing this service.
 
<section> Introduction
 
<section> According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is estimated that approximately 5%
 (432 million adults and 34 million children) of the world’s population experience a disabling
 hearing loss. This figure is expected to rise significantly by 2050, with around 1 in every 10 peo-
 ple, roughly 700 million individuals, projected to have a disabling hearing loss [1]. For adults
 aged 15 years and older, a disabling hearing loss is defined as a loss of hearing greater than
 decibels (dBs) in the better hearing ear [1]. Interestingly, a significant majority of those
 affected, 80% reside in low and middle income countries such as Sub-Saharan Africa, South
 Asia, and Asia Pacific region [1]. Specifically, in South Africa, the prevalence of hearing loss
 estimated to be much higher than reported 5% figure, making hearing loss the third highest
 reported disability alongside vision and physical disability [2]. The data used for estimating
 population living with disabilities, including hearing loss, is based on outdated information
 such as the 2011 national census, which is over a decade old. Therefore, these reports may be
 unreliable and inaccurate in assessing the true extent of hearing loss in the country [2,3].

<section> Hearing aids uptake
 
<section> Despite the high prevalence of hearing loss in the elderly population worldwide, the use and
 uptake of hearing aids is still poor [4,5]. A plethora of studies have investigated the reasons for
 poor uptake of hearing aids. These including hearing aids being uncomfortable, difficulty han-
 dling hearing aids, patients’ attitudes towards hearing loss and hearing aids, and poor under-
 standing of the role of audiologists’ in supporting and counselling patients to promote hearing
 aid use [6–8].
 Hearing aids have the potential to significantly improve an individual’s access to sound in
 various environments [9] providing several clinically- proven benefits to the wearer. These
 benefits include reducing listening effort, enhancing communication, slowing down cognitive
 decline and improving overall quality of life (QoL) [10]. When a person is initially fitted with
 hearing aid, the duration and severity of their hearing loss determine the process needed in
 their management. in most cases, the hearing aid stimulates the ear-brain neural network sys-
 tem, with the sound being encoded at different stages of processing, including: the ear, brain-
 stem, midbrain, and the cortex [11]. Consequently, the brain requires time to readjust and
 become familiar once again with the high and low frequency sounds of speech and environ-
 mental noise. To facilitate this adjustment process, it is recommended to provide individuals
 with a hearing aid trial period. During this trial period, the user is provided the opportunity
 try out hearing aids before making a purchase, with the option to return or exchange them
 [12]. Typically, a trial period is conducted to allow the audiologist or hearing aid dispenser the
 opportunity to ensure a comfortable fit of the hearing aid, fine tune them for personalised
 sound quality, prevent feedback and enable the user to use the hearing aids in various listening
 environments [13]. At the conclusion of the trial period, the user has the option to retain the
 hearing aids, try out new hearing aid(s) as a trial or return the hearing aids [13]. Although liter-
 ature suggests a minimum duration of 30 days for a hearing aid trial [13,14], there is currently
 no evidence-based practice to support this specific time period.
 
<section> Standardization of hearing aid trials
 
<section> Globally, the practice of conducting hearing aid trial seems to be an ‘up-in-the-air’ process,
 lacking standardised frameworks or regulations regarding the recommended duration of the
 trial period. This absence of standardised guidelines on the hearing aid trial period as well as
 the number hearing aids available for trial leads to inconsistency across different parts of the
 world [15].
 As mentioned earlier, hearing aid users need several weeks or more to acclimatize and ‘re-
 train the brain’ to identify certain frequencies and sounds. It is for this reason that in the
 United States, it is against the law to not offer trial periods to potential users as people with dif-
 ferent types of hearing loss respond differently to hearing aids [12]. In countries such as South
 Africa, where there are no laws or regulations pertaining to hearing aid trial periods, some
 audiologists’ establish their own trial periods [12]. This indicates that audiologists’ are aware
 the need to have policies or regulations governing the evidence-based practice when dispens-
 ing hearing aids to potential users. Currently, there are no international regulatory or govern-
 ing bodies overseeing the sale and manufacturing of hearing aids. In the USA for instance, the
 sale of hearing aids is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Food and
 Drug Administration (FDA) [15]. According to these entities, any individual who feels they
 may struggle adapting to amplification should enquire about trialing or renting the hearing
 aids before making any decisions on purchasing them [15]. In South Africa, theoretically, the
 sale of hearing aids fall under the ambit of the South African Health Products Regulatory
 Authority (SAHPRA). SAHPRA is the regulatory authority responsible for ensuring the 
<section> quality, safety, and efficacy of health products, including medical devices such as hearing aids
 [16]. Specifically, hearing aids are regulated by the Medicines Control Unit, under the Rule
 (1)(a)–an active medical device for therapy to administer energy to a patient, or exchange
 energy to or from a patient. Thus, a hearing aid is an example of a sound energy device. This
 document does not give guidance on the practise of providing hearing aid trials for audiolo-
 gists’ or the warranty period of hearing aids.
 A lack of standardised hearing aid trials may contribute to unintended consequences
 
<section> including:
 
<section> i. unequal access: some individuals may not have the opportunity to adequately assess the suit-
 ability and effectiveness of hearing aids before making a decision. This is particularly true for
 adults in lower socioeconomic settings, resulting in a lower prevalence of hearing aid use [17].
 ii. limited evaluation time: without a standardized trial period, patients may have limited time
 to assess the benefits and limitations of hearing aids, potentially leading to dissatisfaction
 suboptimal outcomes. One researcher argued that not all adults provided with hearing aids
 use them, wear them regularly, or are satisfied with them [18].
 
<section> iii. Varied professional guidance: hearing aid trial periods often involve guidance and support
 from audiologists’ or hearing healthcare professionals. Without standardization, the level
 of professional guidance during the trial period may differ, potentially impacting the qual-
 ity of fitting, counselling and adjustments made to optimize the hearing aid settings for
 individual users. According to Ismail et al, hearing healthcare professionals can exert an
 important impact on patient outcomes [19].
 
<section> iv. Increased financial risk: hearing aids are expensive, and most insurance plans don’t cover
 routinely cover them, and in most cases, users typically pay for aids and fittings out of
 pocket [20]. Without standardized trial periods, hearing aids can be a significant financial
 if individuals make a decision to purchase without sufficient time to determine if the hear-
 ing aids meet their needs and preferences. This potentially leads to financial losses if the
 chosen hearing aid does not provide the desired outcomes.
 
<section> v. Quality Assurance: consistency across manufactures in describing the features of hearing
 aids enables users to compare features and not solely rely on audiologists’, and hearing aid
 dispensers for that information [21] Providing standardized Challenges with providing
 hearing aid trials in low and middle income countries.
 
<section> Despite the high prevalence of disabling hearing loss in the African region, there is a signifi-
 cant shortage of audiologists’ to provide hearing healthcare services. Approximately 78% of
 countries in Africa have less than one audiologist per million population, whereas 52% of
 European countries have more than 10 audiologists’ per million [22]. This scarcity of human
 resources limits the capacity to diagnose and manage hearing loss using hearing technology,
 including the ability to offer hearing aid trial periods.
 In South Africa the healthcare system is divided into public and private sectors. Around
 84% of the population relies on public healthcare services, while 16% affords private healthcare
 [22,23]. As a result, the majority of the South African’s with a hearing loss depend on the pub-
 lic sector for their healthcare needs [24]. Moreover, one study reported that only 22% of audi-
 ologists’ are employed in the public sector [25,26]. This imbalance in the distribution of
 audiologists’ negatively impacts service delivery and patient accessibility to hearing healthcare
 services, including the provision of hearing aids, and the opportunity for hearing aid trial peri-
 ods. Furthermore, the private sector in South Africa may face pressure to meet sales targets of
 hearing aids, as it operates in a more market-driven environment. On the other hand, the 
<section> public sector is funded by the government and may not have the same pressure to prioritize
 hearing aid sales. This distinction potentially influences the availability and promotion of hear-
 ing aid trial period, as well as the overall approach to hearing healthcare. Collectively, these fac-
 tors contribute to the challenges faced in providing adequate hearing healthcare services,
 including access to hearing aids and standardised trial periods, particularly within the public
 sector in South Africa. Addressing the shortage of human resource and promoting equitable
 access to hearing healthcare services are crucial for improving outcomes for individuals with
 hearing loss in low and middle income countries.
 
<section> Rationale
 
<section> Evidence suggests that audiologists’ who offer hearing aid trials report a higher success rate in
 hearing aid sales and increased patient satisfaction [12,27]. A study by Knudsen et al [28]
 investigating hearing aid success and failures, it was found that 80% of participants who under-
 went hearing aid trials were satisfied with the process, resulting in a 60% hearing aid purchase
 rate in the study population [28]. This study appears to be the only one available on hearing
 trials, indicating a lack of large scale research on hearing aid trial periods globally. To fully
 understand the benefits of hearing aid trials, it is essential to start by investigating audiologists’
 current practices in relation to hearing aid trials. Such research would provide valuable
 insights into the potential advantages of making trial periods a mandatory practice within
 rehabilitation process. Currently, there is a dearth of research in this area, globally. Thus this
 study aims to explore the practices of audiologists’ in providing hearing aid trials.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Research aims
 
<section> 1. To investigate audiologists’ practices related to hearing aid trials.
 
<section> The specific objectives of the study were
 
<section> • To examine the practices used by audiologists’ for fitting hearing aids
 
<section> • To analyse the approaches employed by audiologists’ during the hearing aid trialing process
 
<section> • To determine the average number of hearing aids typically trialed by audiologists’
 
<section> • To assess the average duration of a hearing aid trial conducted by audiologists’
 
<section> Research design
 
<section> This was a two-phased explanatory sequential mixed methods cross-sectional study. Phase one
 was quantitative in nature and employed a questionnaire to capture audiologist’s practices in
 providing hearing aid trials. This was followed by a qualitative phase where interviews were
 conducted with hearing aid users to explore their experiences with undergoing a hearing aid
 trial. However, for the current study, we are reporting on Phase 1, exploring the practices of
 audiologists’ in providing hearing aid trials.
 
<section> Participants and sample size
 
<section> Purposive sampling was used to specifically recruit audiologists’ practising in South Africa and
 registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA). A prior sample size

 was not determined for this study due to the difficult in ascertaining the actual number of
 practicing audiologists’ in South Africa. The sample size could only be determined based on
 audiologists’ registered with the HPCSA or the professional organisations, which in most cases
 is inaccurate as some people may be registered but may not be practising or may be practising
 and not be registered with the professional association boards. Furthermore, this study was
 administered online, the researcher had to rely on the professional organisations to act as gate-
 keepers in distributing the survey link to potential participants. This provided a challenge as
 the number of potential participants that could be reached. As such, it was difficult to estimate
 the number of participants to achieve an adequate statistical power and precision to ensure the
 study’s results are statistically meaningful and reliable. A sample of 95 audiologists’ was
 obtained (Table 1). Participants had to meet the necessary inclusion criteria to participate in
 the study. This included: audiologists’ currently registered with the HPCSA who were cur-
 rently practicing at the time of the study in any institution within South Africa and its
 provinces.
 
<section> Data collection method
 
<section> For the first phase of the study, data were collected by means of an online survey conducted
 via Google Forms (S1 Appendix). Google Forms was chosen as it is freely accessible and user
 friendly. The survey was self-developed, consisting of 24 closed-ended questions and 13 open-
 ended questions. The open-ended questions consisted of an elaboration of some of the closed-
 ended responses. The survey was divided into six sections: background information, hearing
 aid characteristics, hearing aid trials, counselling, patient satisfaction, and brain maturation
 hearing aids. The questionnaire was developed in English because it is widely used in profes-
 sional communication and this study purposively recruited professionals. Based on the pilot
 study feedback, the survey completion time was five minutes on average. According to
 research, shorter surveys are more likely to be completed with a higher response rate than lon-
 ger surveys [29]. Moreover, closed-ended responses have a quicker response duration. The
 majority of questions in this survey were closed-ended, thus, the time period to complete the
 survey was short.
 
<section> Pilot study
 
<section> Three audiologists’ meeting the inclusion criteria were approached and requested to partici-
 pate in the pilot phase of the study by direct invitation through the researcher’s network. The
 first audiologist was requested to assess the content, language and length of the survey. 
<section> Feedback recommended: i) to include an option that ‘more than one option’ may be given on
 three of the survey questions; ii) Additionally, to add an option to elaborate on ‘no’ responses
 for three of the survey questions. Once the suggested corrections were made, the survey was
 then given to a second audiologist to provide feedback on the length and content of the survey.
 A change to the duration of the survey from ten minutes to five minutes was recommended
 the completion time was quicker than anticipated by the researcher. Lastly, the content and
 questions were deemed straight forward. The third audiologist was recruited for the second
 phase of the study. Participants in the pilot study were required to meet the same inclusion cri-
 teria for the research study (as mentioned above). These two audiologists’ were excluded from
 the main study.
 
<section> Ethics statement
 
<section> Ethical clearance was obtained from the University’s Human Research Ethics Committee
 (Medical) (Protocol number: M191054). Participants provided informed consent by clicking
 the ‘continue’ button on Google Forms after reading and understanding the information
 sheet. Participants were thus made aware that informed consent would be assumed once they
 proceeded with the study after reading the information sheet. All methods were carried out
 accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.
 
<section> Data collection procedure
 
<section> After obtaining ethics clearance from the Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical) (Pro-
 tocol number: M191054), professional organizations, namely the South African Association
 Audiologists’ (SAAA) and South African Speech-Language-Hearing Association (SASHLA)
 were approached via email and requested to distribute the self-developed survey to audiolo-
 gists’ on their emailing lists. Additionally, audiologists’ on social media platforms, such as
 Facebook groups and LinkedIn, were targeted. The first page of the survey consisted of the
 information letter, where the purpose, inclusion criteria and study requirements were detailed.
 Potential participants were advised that clicking on the start button at the end of the informa-
 tion letter meant they were giving consent to participate on the online survey. Upon clicking
 the start button, participants were directed to the survey question on Google Forms. Data col-
 lection took place over a period of six months between February and July 2020.
 
<section> Data analysis
 
<section> Data were captured in Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word. Both close-ended and open-
 ended questions were analysed quantitatively using descriptive analysis. Descriptive analysis
 concerned with summarizing data with large amounts of numbers that could not otherwise
 comprehended by looking at them. As such, frequency tables and graphs were used to summa-
 rize the data more comprehensively. This allowed the researcher to capture information and
 analyse it more efficiently.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Hearing aid characteristics
 
<section> From the 95 audiologists’ who participated in the survey, 94.74% (n = 90) provided hearing
 aid fittings as part of their services, while 5% (n = 5) do not fit hearing aids (Table 2). Table 2
 below further indicates how majority of audiologists’ reported dispensing and fitting three or
 more hearing aid brands as part of their practice, providing their patients with a variety of
 options to choose from when selecting a hearing aid.

 Audiologists’ were asked how they choose the hearing aid for their patients or if patients
 choose their own hearing aids. The results revealed that 28.42% (n = 27) of audiologists’ choose
 the hearing aid for their patients based on their audiogram. On the other hand, 54.74%
 (n = 52) of audiologists’ choose the hearing aids, however, in consultation with their patients.
 This suggests that these audiologists’ do consider the patient’s needs as well as the situation
 (i.e. cost, appearance etc). The reasons that were given on which hearing aid to choose are indi-
 cated below (Table 3).
 Taking into account the patient’s hearing loss when choosing a hearing aid is one of the
 most important decisions within the hearing aid fitting process. Audiologists’ were further
 asked when choosing a hearing aid, what is the most common determining factor for the hear-
 ing aid user when deciding on which hearing aid to choose from. As seen in Fig 1 below, the
 audiologists’ recommendation as well as the audiological features of the hearing aid were
 highlighted as the most important factors.
 
<section> Return rates on hearing aids
 
<section> The audiologists’ were asked to state possible explanations as to why some patients may return
 their hearing aids, with the option to choose more than one answer (Table 4). Top on the list
 were financial implications followed by not being psychologically ready for hearing aid, find-
 ing no benefit from amplification, the stigma attached to wearing hearing aids, discomfort
 from the hearing aid, and the sound quality of the hearing aids.
 Table 5 below represents the physical and audiological complaints of hearing aids as
 described by the audiologists’. Majority of their patients reported comfort, hearing aid size,
 and the battery size as the most common complaint about the physical hearing aid itself. Col-
 our and style were the least reported physical complaints of the hearing aids by the hearing aid
 users.
 More than half of the audiologists’ reported that their patients complained about back-
 ground noise as a negative factor whilst wearing hearing aids with feedback, echo and loudness

 were muffled, blocked and sharpness/tinniness of the hearing aids.
 
<section> Trial period
 
<section> Audiologists’ in this study were asked about their perceptions on whether or not audiologists’
 should be offering hearing aid trial periods. The results revealed 93.68% (n = 89) believe that
 audiologists’ should offer hearing aid trials as part of their service-delivery to the patients. On
 the other hand, 6.32% (n = 6) believe that audiologists’ should not provide trials based on the
 
<section> following reasons:
 
<section> • The hearing aid users may lose or break the hearing aid during the trial period.
 
<section> • Audiologists’ do not have the opportunity to trial hearing aids in the government sector.

 • Hearing aid trials were too expensive and time consuming.
 • Hearing aid trials are an insurance risk to the practice.
 • And lastly, as described by one participant: “the adjustment time for the brain to adapt to
 new hearing aids as well as the multiple listening opportunities are not accommodated by
 the trial period”. 
<iend>

 
<section> Duration of a trial period
 
<section> Audiologists’ were further asked to recommend a suitable period for hearing aid trials. Eighty-
 nine participants (93.68%) who felt that the trial period is a necessity made their recommenda-
 tions (Fig 2). Majority of participants stated that 14 days (43.82%, n = 39) was a suitable period
 for a hearing aid trial, with 30 days (24.72%, n = 22) as the second suggested duration.
 In establishing audiologists’ methods of hearing aid trialing practices, the results indicated
 that 72.63% (n = 69) of audiologists’ reported offering trialing of hearing aids as mandatory
 practice within their services, while 27.37% (n = 26) did not. From those who did not offer
 
<section> Fig 2. Subjective opinions of the duration of trial periods.
 
<section> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002552.g002 
<section> hearing trials, n = 15 reported working in a government hospital, clinic, or rural area. Report-
 edly, hearing aid trials were logistically impossible and thus not feasible to conduct. Some rea-
 sons for this were due to: a limited amount of available staff, long waiting lists, not being stated
 in the policy, not being permitted, financial implications, insurance purposes, and travel limi-
 tations from the patient’s side.
 
<section> Number of hearing aids to test per trial period
 
<section> Majority of audiologists’ who offered hearing aid trials offered two different hearing aids for
 trialing (26.09%, n = 18) while others preferred to trial only one (17.39%, n = 12) hearing aid.
 Only 1.45% (n = 1) participant reported trialing 3 or more hearing aids per trial period. More
 than half of the participants (55.07%, n = 38) reported trialing between one to two hearing aids
 but it was patient-specific and circumstantial.
 To determine a suitable number of hearing aids that could be tested per trial period, the
 results revealed a large number of audiologists’ offered more than one hearing aid trial to their
 patients which can be seen in Fig 3 that depicts n = 12 participants trialing their patients for
 two weeks with one or more hearing aid(s). The next most common chosen duration was a
 one-week trial with one or more hearing aid(s).
 Audiologists’ were further asked to describe their thought process when deciding to trial
 hearing aids. Only n = 31 participants responded to this question. The following responses
 
<section> were prominent:
 Some audiologists’ (54.84%, n = 17) reported only allowing patients to trial hearing aids on
 request while 45.16% (n = 14) reported offering the hearing aid trial without it being requested
 by the patient. After having trialed one, two, or three hearings aids, audiologists’ reported that
 77.42% (n = 24) of patients end up choosing the first hearing aid they trialed. On the other
 hand, 9.68% (n = 3) choose the second hearing aid and only 6.45% (n = 2) choose the third or
 last hearing aid that they trialed. These results indicated a preference for the first hearing aid
 trialed.

<section> Discussion
 
<section> In South Africa, health care professionals such as audiologists’ and speech therapists in urban-
 ized and densely populated provinces such as Gauteng and Western Cape tend to provide pri-
 vate services more than the public sector services [25]. For the less populated provinces like
 Limpopo, Northern Cape, Northwest and Mpumalanga, the converse is true with more health
 care workers in the public sector. Nationally, there are only 22% of audiologists’ and speech
 therapists employed in the public sector [25].
 To date, the private sector in South Africa dominates the healthcare sector, attracting
 majority of professionals, even though the country has a larger public sector [30]. The demo-
 graphic profile of audiologists’ in this study in terms of practice sector, complement the find-
 ings by two studies who discuss a shortage of key healthcare workers in the rural-urban and
 public-private divides within in the country [22]. Additionally, the public sector caters for
 approximately 84% of the population while only 16% of South Africans are served by the pri-
 vate sector. This inequality of services is unfortunately further worsened by unequal access to
 services between and within the urban and rural public sectors [25]. With this being said,
 fewer audiologists’ and fewer resources within the public sector limits the ability to provide
 access to hearing aid services [22] and therefore hearing aid trial periods.
 
<section> Hearing aid characteristics
 
<section> With new advances in technology such as the digital hearing aid, there are a number of advan-
 tages over the “old school” analogue hearing aids. These include: digital feedback and noise
 reduction, increased comfort, smaller size, open fit designs, and speech enhancement [19].
 With this, audiologists’ now have greater flexibility when choosing the best technology for their
 patient’s hearing needs. The majority of audiologists’ in this study supplied and fitted three or
 more brands of hearing aids during their fitting practices to provide their patients with a variety
 of options. This created the opportunity to problem solve which style or level of technology to
 recommend to their patients and which would benefit their personal needs the most. Further-
 more, hearing aid manufacturers have provided audiologists’ with huge improvements in tech-
 nology, hearing aid software, and tools—with a resultant increase in patient satisfaction [31].
 Therefore, when it comes to choosing the right hearing aid the question of “who is the driving
 force behind the decision making?” was explored. The majority of audiologists’ in the study
 stated that decisions regarding the brand and style of the hearing aid is a collaborative decision
 between the audiologist and the patient. Only in situations where patients are uncertain do the
 audiologists’ make a decision on the behalf of the patient. This means that hearing aid users rely
 on the support, guidance and expertise of their audiologists’ when choosing a hearing aid.
 These results correlate with one study on success and failure factors for hearing aid prescription,
 where audiologist’s recommendation, followed by the price of the hearing aid, and the success
 of the hearing aid trial, were the factors leading to success [28]. Another study stated that con-
 sidering the degree, type and configuration of a hearing loss when choosing a hearing aid
 increases the successful outcomes of hearing aid fittings with its useful implementation [32].
 Hong et al stated that the patient and the audiologist should be equally involved in the hear-
 ing aid fitting process and that they both have responsibilities regarding hearing aid selection
 and fitting [31]. If each party participates and attends to their unique responsibilities, then it
 more likely that the hearing aid fitting is successful.
 Thus, according to the results, the researcher is in agreement with the first mentioned study
 [28] whereby the audiologist’s advice played an important role in hearing aid acquisition. The
 audiologist is therefore the driving force on the decision making when it comes to choosing
 the brand or style of the hearing aid for their patients. 
<section> Return rates on hearing aids
 
<section> Audiologists’ in the study stated that their patients rarely return their hearing aids once fitted,
 or, that one in every five returned their hearing aids at most. Audiologists’ reported the follow-
 ing reason for the return of hearing aid: death (the hearing aids are returned by a family mem-
 ber), discomfort of the hearing aid, financial implications, dissatisfaction from the hearing aid
 and that the hearing aids didn’t reach their expectations. Some similarities can be seen in a
 research study on clinical reasons for hearing aid returns in Korea from 1138 hearing aid users
 who were prescribed hearing aids over a three-year period. They found that ineffectiveness of
 the hearing aid, noise (such as feedback), over-amplification, managing and handling the
 devices, and lastly, financial aspects were the most common reported reasons for hearing aid
 returns. Despite advances in technology, 3–16% of individuals in their study returned the hear-
 ing aids over the three-year period [33].
 More than half of the audiologists’ in the current study reported that their patients com-
 plained about background noise as a negative factor whilst wearing hearing aids with feedback,
 echo and loudness being the next most common complaints. A review of research study found
 that background noises and surrounding sounds were the most common complaints reported
 by hearing aid users [34].
 
<section> Trial period
 
<section> After years of experiencing communication difficulties, which undoubtedly impacts a person’s
 life, the decision to try hearing aids brings about all kinds of expectations and fears. These
 occur due to the hearing loss, and not the hearing aids [35]. This study aimed to determine
 whether the availability of a trial period would influence the next step in the process, which is
 the decision to then actually purchase hearing aids.
 As mentioned earlier, a hearing aid trial period may convince individuals to try amplification
 who otherwise would not do so. Almost all of the audiologist participants in this study reported
 that audiologists’ should be offering trial periods for hearing aids in South Africa as part of their
 practices. With this being said, 72.63% of audiologists’ in the study actually provide hearing aid
 als to their patients. Moreover, 54,84% of these audiologists’ reported only allowing patients to
 trial hearing aids on request, while the other 45,16% reported offering the hearing aid trials with-
 out it being requested by the patient. These results indicated that approximately 50% of audiolo-
 gists’ offer hearing aid trials to their patients as part of their daily practices. Audiologists’ who offer
 trials reported a higher success rate in hearing aid sales and patient satisfaction [12,27]. One study
 describes how the benefits of hearing aid amplification continue to increase after the initial experi-
 ence with the amplified signal over a period of 6–12 weeks [36]. This means that the initial adjust-
 ment period to hearing aids is one of the most important processes to achieve successful hearing
 aid outcomes. With this said, not enough audiologists’ provide the opportunity for their patients
 to adjust to their hearing aids in order to achieve these satisfactory outcomes. Some users may not
 even be aware of the opportunity to trial hearing aids if not offered directly by their audiologist.
 Some audiologists’ in the current study were concerned that they cannot guarantee the safe
 care and return of hearings aids, which poses insurance risk to their practices. Additionally,
 audiologists’ working in public hospitals or clinics in particular do not provide trial periods
 because of staff shortage, long waiting lists for hearing aids, no guarantee of return of hearing
 aid, and trials not being part of their standard practice. There is a shortage of staff and available
 resources in the rural and government sectors in South Africa which unfortunately leads to
 opportunity for trial periods to be provided.
 The population of individuals who have a hearing loss could be impacted from communica-
 tion difficulties and a restricted social life. These negative effects of hearing loss on QoL can 
<section> improved with the use of hearing aids. The hearing aid users who adjust successfully to hearing
 aids typically experience higher self-esteem compared to those who do not wear their hearing
 aids regularly and consistently [36]. All of the audiologists’ reported that they do believe hear-
 ing aid users need time to adjust to their hearing aid(s). If this adjustment period is known,
 then according to the results, not enough audiologists’ are providing this service of hearing aid
 trials to their patients before they make their decision on which brand/style works best for
 them.
 
<section> Duration of a trial period
 
<section> According to literature, the most common duration of a trial period is a minimum of 30 days
 [13,14]. However, there is no evidence-based practice to support this suggested time period.
 What is known is that the hearing aid manufacturing companies offer a 30-day return policy
 for users who wish to return their hearing aids. This period is separate to a hearing aid trialing
 period.
 One research study complimented the current study in declaring that hearing aid users
 have difficulty adjusting to the hearing aids and individuals who did not wear their hearing
 aids regularly needed a longer time to adjust to them and should persevere during the initial
 period of obtaining hearing aids [5]. Audiologists’ in the current study reported that based on
 their experiences and practices, hearing aid users require an average of a two-week trial period
 or a one-month trial period before purchasing the devices. This is evident in their practices as
 majority of audiologists’ reported that, on average, they offer a two-week trial period.
 
<section> Number of hearing aids to test per trial period
 
<section> In cases where up to three brands of hearing aids are trialed, audiologists’ reported that more
 than half of patients end up choosing the first hearing aid they trialed. These results indicate
 preference for the first hearing aid trialed. This may be due to the users remembering the
 immediate benefits achieved from their first trial. Audiologists’ further stated that the average
 number of hearing aids they trial their patients on is two hearing aids, thus giving their patients
 a choice between two different brands or styles to choose from.
 Hearing aids are known to improve QoL. Hearing difficulty may be reduced with an effec-
 tive, well programmed, hearing aid. This will also reduce the negative effects of social and emo-
 tional interactions caused by a hearing loss [37]. With the use of an effective trial period and
 the correct duration and amount of hearing aids to trial, this may in turn add to the increase
 QoL of hearing aid wearers as they will be able to assess the benefits of the hearing aids in all
 their social and working environments. In conclusion, as stated by one study “it is only the
 supervised and positive experience with amplification that converts them from deniers into
 users. In this perspective, trial periods will increase rather than decrease the number of people
 who purchase hearing aids” [35].
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> Based on the findings of the current study, it can be concluded that providing hearing aid trials
 routinely is crucial in the rehabilitation process, while taking into account the availability of
 necessary resources. This study revealed 72.63% of audiologists’ provide hearing aid trials,
 with a smaller proportion incorporating hearing aid trials as part of their routine practice
 rather than solely upon request. In this study, audiologists’ agreed that offering a hearing aid
 trial before purchasing a hearing aid may yield desired outcomes. From an ethical standpoint,
 if hearing aids improve hearing aid outcomes and quality of life, audiologists’ should consider
 including hearing aid trials as part of their practices to enhance service delivery as healthcare 
<section> professionals. While hearing aids trials demonstrate numerous benefits for users and could
 potentially become standard practice not only in South Africa but also internationally. As
 such, further research is recommended in this area.
 It is also worth noting that the provision of a hearing aid trial is not only beneficial to the
 users but also to the audiologists’ as well. Audiologists’ stand to benefit from every hearing aid
 purchased and successfully fitted. Therefore, it is important to identify factors that affect hear-
 ing aid usage to implement appropriate rehabilitation strategies and ensure greater utilization
 of hearing aids.
 Audiologists’ should play an active role in offering hearing aid trials to their patients, partic-
 ularly first-time hearing aid users. Even though experienced hearing aid users may not feel
 confident with their hearing aids, it is important to note that technology is continuously
 advancing, offering improved features, sound quality, accessories, comfort and size. As such,
 hearing aid trials should still be offered to all hearing aid users, irrespective of their previous
 experience with hearing aids. There is a clear need to provide hearing aid trials to optimise out-
 comes for patients and ensure that they receive the most suitable and beneficial hearing aid
 solution.
 
<section> Limitations
 
<section> A small study sample of 95 audiologists’ who conduct hearing aid trials cannot be generalized
 to the greater audiology population who perform hearing aid trials. Additionally, the study is
 limited to the South African population and thus cannot be generalized world-wide.
