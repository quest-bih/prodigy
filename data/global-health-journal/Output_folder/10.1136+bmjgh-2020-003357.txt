<section> ABSTRACT
 
<section> Introduction Short message service (SMS) reminders
 coupled with a small monetary incentive conditioned
 on prompt vaccination have been shown to improve
 first-­dose measles-­containing vaccine (MCV1) uptake.
 We assessed whether SMS reminders and unconditional
 monetary incentives—more amenable to programmatic
 implementation—can improve MCV1 uptake in Kenya.
 
<section> Methods Caregivers of eligible infants aged 6–8 months
 were enrolled into an individually randomised controlled
 trial and assigned to receive either: no intervention
 (control), two SMS reminders (SMS) sent 3 days, and 1
 day before the scheduled MCV1 date, or SMS reminders
 coupled with a Kenya Shilling (KES) 150 incentive (SMS
 +150 KES) sent 3 days before the scheduled MCV1 date.
 Study staff conducted a household follow-­up visit at age
 12 months to ascertain vaccination status. Log-­binomial
 regression was used to estimate the relative and absolute
 difference in MCV1 timely coverage (by age 10 months),
 the primary outcome.
 
<section> Results Between 6 December 2016 and 31 March
 2017, 179 infants were enrolled into each of the three
 study arms. Follow-­up visits were completed between
 19 April 2017 and 8 October 2017 for control (n=170),
 SMS (n=157) and SMS + 150 KES (n=158) children.
 MCV1 timely coverage was 68% among control arm
 infants compared with 78% in each intervention arm.
 This represented a non-­statistically significant increase
 in the SMS arm (adjusted relative risk 1.13; 95% CI 0.99
 to 1.30; p=0.070; adjusted risk difference 9.2%; 95% CI:
 −0.6 to 19.0%; p=0.066), but a statistically significant
 increase in the SMS + 150 KES arm (1.16; 95% CI
 1.01 to 1.32; p=0.035; 10.6%; 95% CI 0.8 to 20.3%;
 p=0.034).
 
<section> Conclusion These findings suggest that the effect of SMS
 reminders coupled with a small unconditional monetary
 incentive on MCV1 uptake is comparable to that of SMS
 reminders alone, limiting their utility. Further studies in
 the absence of unexpected supply-­side constraints are
 needed.

<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► In low-­income and middle-­income country (LMIC)
 settings, short message service (SMS; text mes-
 sage) reminders alone can significantly improve
 timeliness of first dose measles-­containing vaccine
 (MCV1) receipt—that is, vaccination within a short
 window of the recommended age—but evidence of
 their impact on the overall proportion of infants re-
 ceiving MCV1 is mixed.
 
<section> ► The effect of SMS reminders coupled with a small
 conditional monetary incentive on MCV1 timeliness
 and MCV1 coverage by age 12 months appears to be
 superior to that of SMS reminders alone.
 
<section> ► Unconditional incentives may be more feasibly deliv-
 ered compared with conditional incentives but their
 effectiveness under real-­ world conditions within
 LMIC immunisation programmes is unknown.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► SMS reminders coupled with a small unconditional
 monetary incentive improved MCV1 timeliness but
 not MCV1 coverage by age 12 months in rural Kenya.
 
<section> ► The magnitude of the effect of SMS reminders cou-
 pled with an unconditional incentive on MCV1 time-
 liness and MCV1 coverage by age 12 months was
 similar to that of SMS reminders alone.
 
<section> What do the new findings imply?
 
<section> ► These findings suggest no added effect of small
 unconditional monetary incentives over that of SMS
 reminders alone. However, the findings may have
 been limited by supply-­side barriers to vaccination
 and additional studies are needed to validate the
 findings.
 
<section> ► This study adds to the body of evidence on the com-
 bined effect of SMS reminders and incentives; it is
 the second to evaluate the effect SMS reminders
 coupled with any kind of monetary incentive and the
 first to assess the effect of SMS reminders coupled
 with unconditional incentives. 
<section> INTRODUCTION
 Measles vaccination is estimated to have prevented 1.3
 million global deaths annually between 2000 and 2018
 and to have decreased annual measles incidence by
 approximately two-­thirds in the same period. 1 However,
 the full potential of measles-­containing vaccine (MCV)
 to prevent morbidity and mortality remains unrealised.
 Failure to achieve measles control targets, including
 elimination, is largely attributable to suboptimal measles
 vaccination uptake.
 In 2019, global coverage for the first and second doses
 of MCV was 85% and 71%, respectively, 2 falling below
 the threshold of 95% coverage with two MCV doses
 needed for measles elimination. 3 Inequalities in vaccina-
 tion coverage at the global level—for example, first-­dose
 MCV (MCV1) coverage in 2019 was 69% in WHO Africa
 Region 4 compared with >90% in the WHO Europe,
 South East Asia and Western Pacific Regions 5–7 —and at
 the subnational level are widely acknowledged. 8
 Given high levels of mobile phone ownership and access
 in low-­income and middle-­income countres (LMICs)—
 in 2017 there were 99 and 77 mobile phone subscribers
 per 100 inhabitants in developing and African countries,
 respectively —mobile phone-­ based interventions may
 improve demand for routine MCV. Indeed, short message
 service (SMS; text message) reminders alone or coupled
 with other interventions have been shown to: increase
 uptake of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP)
 containing vaccine 11–19 ; increase uptake of MCV 17 19 ;
 improve full immunisation coverage (FIC) 12 17–19 ; and
 improve vaccine-­seeking in general 21 among caregivers of
 infants in a variety of LMICs. In addition, SMS reminders
 coupled with mobile phone-­based incentives (airtime and
 mobile money (mMoney)) have been shown to improve
 uptake of DTP-­containing vaccine, uptake of MCV, FIC
 and age-­appropriate vaccination coverage 22 among chil-
 dren in LMICs.
 Previously, we showed that SMS reminders coupled
 with small, conditional mMoney incentives significantly
 improved measles vaccination timeliness (ie, the propor-
 tion of children vaccinated within 2 weeks of the vaccine
 due date) and measles vaccination coverage (ie, the
 proportion of children receiving measles vaccination by
 age 12 months) in a cluster randomised controlled trial
 conducted in Kenya. In that study, incentives were condi-
 tioned on receipt of measles vaccination within 2 weeks
 of the recommended age. 17 Scaling up SMS reminders
 coupled with conditional incentives in Kenya may not
 be feasible as it would require real-­time monitoring of
 vaccination receipt in order to determine if caregivers
 meet the conditions for receiving the incentive. In turn,
 real-­time monitoring of vaccination receipt under real-­
 world conditions is challenged by limitations in the
 human and/or financial resources needed to implement
 it. Thus, unconditional incentives which do not require
 monitoring of vaccination receipt prior to delivery, may
 be more feasibly delivered at scale to improve measles
 vaccination coverage.
 
<section> We sought to evaluate the impact of SMS reminders
 coupled with an unconditional mMoney incentive on
 MCV1 timeliness and coverage in Kenya.
 
<section> METHODS
 Study design and participants
 The Mobile and Scalable Innovations for Measles Immu-
 nisation (M-­SIMI) study was a three-­arm parallel indi-
 vidually randomised controlled trial conducted in Gem
 subcounty, Siaya County, Kenya. Gem subcounty is a
 predominantly rural setting with a population of approx-
 imately 164 000 in 2016 23 24 characterised by relatively
 high malaria, HIV and tuberculosis prevalence and high
 infant mortality. 25 Vaccination coverage was over 90% for
 third dose DTP-­containing vaccine (DTP3) and 84% for
 MCV1 by age 12 months in 2014–2015. 17 The study was
 conducted in areas within the Kenya Medical Research
 Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
 collaboration’s Health and Demographic Surveillance
 System (HDSS).
 
<section> Eligible infants were required to: be aged 6–8 months;
 be residents of the subcounty as reported by the care-
 giver and to not have received a dose of routine measles
 vaccine as indicated in the home-­ based vaccination
 record (maternal and child health booklet). Infants’
 caregivers were required to not have plans to move within
 6 months of enrolment. Mobile phone ownership by the
 caregiver was not a requirement for enrolment. Partic-
 ipants were randomised and evenly allocated to one of
 three study arms: (1) control, (2) SMS reminders (SMS),
 (3) SMS reminders plus a 150 Kenya Shillings incentive
 (KES; SMS+150; KES150=US$1.50 as of December 2016).
 The conduct, analysis and reporting of results were
 conducted in accordance with the Consolidated Stan-
 dards of Reporting Trials guidelines. A detailed descrip-
 tion of the methods and protocol has been reported.
 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 Simple randomisation with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1 to
 the control, SMS or SMS +150 arm was performed using
 a list of computer-­generated random numbers. Rando-
 misation and preparation of the allocation envelopes
 were done by the data manager who had no contact with
 participants. Given the nature of the interventions, study
 field staff and participants were not blinded to the study
 arm. The data analyst had access to participants’ study
 arm allocation during analysis. Additional details on the
 allocation procedure are provided in the supplement.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> Community health volunteers (CHVs)—a component
 of Kenya’s national Community Health Strategy—iden-
 tified households with children aged 6–8 months and
 relayed this information to study-­employed Community
 Interviewers (COMM-­Is). COMM-­Is then visited house-
 holds to provide general information about the study
 and to perform screening procedures. COMM-­Is veri-
 fied age eligibility using the date of birth recorded in 
<section> the home-­ based vaccination record. Written informed
 consent was obtained for eligible caregivers. Immediately
 after enrolment, COMM-­Is collected vaccination status,
 sociodemographic, economic, mobile phone access,
 mobile phone usage, healthcare utilisation and other
 general health information from caregivers. Caregivers
 who did not own a phone were asked to confirm a phone
 number to which SMS reminders and the mMoney incen-
 tive (as applicable) could be sent. Caregivers who could
 not identify a shared phone number for the study were
 offered the option to use the COMM-­I’s work phone
 number. All participants received an enrolment SMS,
 which included a health-­related motivational phrase.
 Control arm participants received no interventions.
 SMS arm participants were sent two SMS reminders; one
 3 days before the scheduled MCV1 date (3-­day reminder)
 and the other 1 day before the scheduled measles vacci-
 nation date (1-­day reminder). SMS+ 150 KES arm partic-
 ipants were sent reminders on the same schedule as the
 SMS arm participants and were sent the KES 150 incen-
 tive 3 days before the scheduled measles vaccination date
 that is, on the same day as the 3-­day reminder.
 SMS reminders were sent in the caregiver’s preferred
 language that is, Dholuo, Kiswahili or English, as indi-
 cated at enrolment. The 3-­day reminder was comprised
 of a standard reminder portion, a phrase intended to
 motivate caregivers and, for SMS+150 KES arm partic-
 ipants, language explaining that the study was sending
 the incentive to assist with travel expenses. The 1-­day
 reminder was the same across intervention arm partic-
 ipants and consisted of a reminder portion as well as a
 motivational phrase that was different from the 3-­day
 reminder motivational phrase (online supplemental
 box S1). 27 Caregivers in the control arm were expected
 to receive one text message (enrolment message only)
 total and those in the intervention arms were expected to
 receive three text messages total.
 SMS reminders were sent out automatically using
 RapidSMS, an open-­ source platform. 28 At enrolment,
 COMM-­ Is submitted an SMS to the RapidSMS server
 containing the infant’s name, infant’s date of birth, and
 caregiver’s preferred phone number. Based on the infor-
 mation submitted, the 3-­day and 1-­day SMS reminders,
 tailored to the applicable study arm and including the
 infants’ name, were sent from the RapidSMS server to
 the phone number provided by the caregiver. The Kenya
 Expanded Programme on Immunisation recommends
 MCV1 administration at age 9 months. 29 Thus, the
 scheduled measles vaccination date was 274 days (30.42
 days/month) from the infant’s date of birth, if falling
 on a weekday. If falling on a Saturday or Sunday, the
 scheduled measles vaccination date was defined as the
 following Monday. RapidSMS was programmed to send
 reminder messages to a study phone to allow monitoring
 of per-­protocol transmission of SMS. Logs of sent SMS
 were generated from RapidSMS.
 RapidSMS was also programmed to automatically
 create a cumulative incentive payment list for infants
 enrolled in the SMS + 150 KES arm. The payment list
 included infants’ Study IDs, caregivers’ preferred phone
 numbers and payment dates (ie, 3 days before the sched-
 uled vaccination date). Using the RapidSMS-­generated
 payment list, study staff manually transmitted the KES
 150 incentive from a smart phone using the M-­PESA
 mobile money platform operated by Safaricom, one of
 Kenya’s mobile network providers.
 COMM-­Is administered a follow-­up survey when infants
 were aged 12 months to collect vaccination status as well
 as information on caregivers’ opinion of the interven-
 tions, reasons for delayed measles vaccination (ie, not
 vaccinated by age 10 months), incentive use and other
 general health information. If the child’s vaccinations
 were not up to date at the follow-­up visit, the COMM-­I
 referred the caregiver to the nearest health facility for
 vaccinations.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome was the proportion of infants
 receiving MCV1 by age 10 months (304 days; ie, MCV1
 timely coverage). Secondary outcomes were the propor-
 tion of infants receiving MCV1 by age 12 months (365
 days; that is, MCV1 coverage) and time to measles vacci-
 nation by age 12 months. At the follow-­up visit, vaccina-
 tion status was ascertained from either the home-­based
 vaccination record or the caregiver’s verbal report if a
 home-­based vaccination record was not available. If the
 home-­based vaccination record was available, the date
 (day, month and year) of vaccination was transcribed
 and used to calculate the infant’s age at vaccination.
 For verbal vaccination reports, caregivers specified the
 month and year of vaccination.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 The study aimed to measure a≥15 percentage point abso-
 lute increase in MCV1 timely coverage in the intervention
 arms compared with the control arm. We presumed that
 a≥15% increase in the proportion of children receiving
 MCV1 by age 10 months would represent a meaningful
 effect from a policy-­maker perspective. Based on previous
 coverage estimates in the study area, 17 we assumed MCV1
 timely coverage of 70% in the M-­SIMI control group.
 We also assumed a type 1 error (alpha) of 0.05, a power
 (1-­beta) of 0.80, yielding a sample size of 134 infants per
 study arm after application of a continuity correction.
 The sample size was adjusted to account for up to 25%
 lost to follow-­up, which included death, outmigration and
 verbal report of measles vaccination at 10 months of age.
 A priori, verbal immunisation reports at the follow-­up
 visit were to be excluded from the analytic sample. After
 accounting for potential losses to follow-­up, the estimated
 sample size to assess the primary outcome was 537 infants
 total, or 179 infants enrolled per study arm.
 Log-­binomial regression was used to estimate the rela-
 tive risk (RR), difference in risk (RD) and respective 95%
 CI of measles vaccination by age 10 months or age
 months in each of the intervention arms compared with 
<section> control arm. For assessment of the primary endpoint
 (MCV1 timely vaccination), children were censored at
 age 10 months. Any predictive baseline characteristics
 determined to be unequally distributed at the 5% signif-
 icance level were included as covariates in the regression
 model to adjust for potential confounding. The primary
 endpoint was analysed according to intention-­ to-­ treat
 (ITT) principles. A modified per-­protocol sensitivity anal-
 ysis for the primary endpoint was also conducted. The
 modified per-­protocol analysis was defined as dispatch of
 two SMS reminders as per the target schedule that is,
 days and 1 day before the scheduled vaccination date.
 In order to evaluate whether baseline participant char-
 acteristics modified the effect of the interventions on the
 likelihood of timely measles vaccination, we performed
 stratified (subgroup) analysis. To identify independent
 variables to include in the subgroup analysis, a risk factor
 analysis of baseline participant characteristics associated
 with MCV1 vaccination by age 10 months was conducted
 among only control arm participants using univariate
 log-­ binomial regression. Characteristics significant at
 the 10% level were included in subgroup analysis. Strat-
 ification by mobile phone ownership status and travel
 time to the health facility were pre-­specified in the study
 protocol. Stratification by maternal education was added
 post hoc, based on evidence of an association between
 higher educational attainment and lower likelihood of
 missed measles vaccination in the study area. 17 The signif-
 icance level for subgroup analysis was 5%.
 Survival analysis was performed to assess whether time
 to measles vaccination differed significantly across the
 study arms. Time origin was defined as enrolment and
 events were right censored at age 365 days. The cumula-
 tive probability of measles vaccination was plotted using
 the failure functions estimated using the Kaplan-­Meier
 method. Equality of the cumulative incidence functions
 were tested using the log-­rank test.
 Analyses were performed using Stata/SE, V.14.1
 (StataCorp).
 
<section> Patient and public involvement
 This study did not involve patients. We did not directly
 include participants or public representatives in the
 design of this study, but the design was informed by focus
 group discussions among community members for a
 similar, related study previously conducted in the same
 area. 30 No participants or public representatives contrib-
 uted to selection of outcome measures. CHVs, who are
 community members, were involved in identification
 of study participants. Study findings were presented to
 CHVs.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> CHVs identified 639 potentially eligible infants between
 6 December 2016 and 31 March 2017. Of those,
 infants—the target sample size—were randomised to the
 control, SMS and SMS + 150 KES arms (179 infants each).
 Follow-­up visits were completed for control (n=170), SMS
 (n=157) and SMS + 150 KES (n=158) infants between
 April 2017 and 8 October 2017. The analytical sample
 included 160 (89%), 146 (82%) and 149 (83%) of all
 infants enrolled in the Control, SMS and SMS + 150 KES
 arms, respectively. Reasons for exclusion from enrol-
 ment, loss to follow-­up and exclusion from the analytical
 sample are provided in figure 1. The 82 participants who
 were excluded from the analytical sample were similar
 to participants in the analytic sample except for birth
 order and maternal age (online supplemental table S1).
 Maternal age was included as an independent variable
 in regression models because it was unevenly distrib-
 uted across study arms (table 1) and has previously been
 shown to be a determinant of childhood vaccination
 status within the study area. 31 The per-­protocol analysis
 included 126 SMS and 126 SMS + 150 KES infants, repre-
 senting 86% and 85% of the analytical sample, respec-
 tively.
 MCV1 timely coverage was 68% (109 of 160) among
 Control arm infants compared with 78% (114 of
 in SMS only; 116 of 149 in SMS + 150 KES) in both the
 intervention arms. This represented a non-­ statistically
 significant increase in the SMS arm (adjusted RR (aRR)
 1.13; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.30; p=0.070; adjusted risk differ-
 ence (aRD) 9.2%; 95% CI −0.6 to 19.0%; p=0.066),
 but a statistically significant increase in the SMS +
 KES arm (aRR 1.16; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32; p=0.035; aRD
 10.6%; 95% CI 0.8 to 20.3%; p=0.034; table 2). In the
 per-­protocol analysis, MCV1 timely coverage in the inter-
 vention arms was similar to ITT MCV1 timely coverage
 and findings were comparable to the ITT analysis with
 the exception that the absolute increase in MCV1 timely
 coverage among SMS infants achieved statistical signifi-
 cance (table 2). None of the characteristics identified in
 the analysis of predictors of vaccination in the Control
 arm (phone ownership, age at enrolment, birth order
 and time to health facility; online supplemental table
 S2) modified the effect of the interventions on MCV1
 timely coverage. Post hoc, maternal age was added to
 the subgroup analysis and similar to the other variables
 assessed, was not found to modify the effect of the inter-
 ventions (figure 2). MCV1 coverage was not significantly
 higher in the SMS (84%; 125 of 160) or SMS + 150 (85%;
 123 of 146) arms compared with the Control arm (78%;
 126 of 149; table 2).
 The median time to measles vaccination was age
 days (IQR 276–324 days) in the control arm, age 284 days
 (IQR 276–298 days) in the SMS arm and age 282 days
 (IQR 275–302 days) in the SMS + 150 KES arm (figure 3).
 There was no significant difference in time to measles
 vaccination across study arms (log-­ rank test p=0.182;
 online supplemental figure S1) even after performing
 testing stratified by maternal age (maternal age ≤25 years
 log-­rank test p=0.195, maternal age >25 years log-­rank test
 p=0.576, stratified log-­rank test p=0.158; data not shown).
 The reason for delayed vaccination was obtained for
 82% (95 of 116) of infants with delayed MCV1. Caregivers

 who were not queried were missed because the inter-
 viewer did not identify them as having delayed vacci-
 nation. Of the infants whose caregivers were queried,
 common (>10%) reasons for not receiving MCV1 by age
 10 months were an ongoing nurses strike (36%) and
 vaccine stock-­ out (16%). Other reported reasons for
 delayed vaccination are provided in table 3. There was
 no significant difference in cause of delayed vaccination
 across study arms (overall χ 2 p=0.529).
 Reasons why reminders were not sent per-­protocol are
 shown in online supplemental table S3. Whereas at least
 one SMS reminder was sent out by the study team to
 participants, 67% (98 of 146) and 81% (120 of 149) of
 SMS arm and SMS + 150 KES arm caregivers, respectively,
 reported that they received at least one SMS reminder.
 The proportion of caregivers who did not know the total
 number of reminders received was significantly higher
 among those sharing a phone compared with those who
 owned the phone receiving messages (table 4). Due to an
 error in the questionnaire skip pattern, caregivers who
 reported not receiving any reminders were not queried as
 to whose phone the reminders were sent. More than 85%
 of caregivers in each of the intervention arms felt that SMS
 reminders influenced the decision to vaccinate (table 4).
 mMoney incentives were sent to all participants in the SMS
 +150 KES arm. Ninety-­one (61%) incentives were sent out
 3 days before the scheduled vaccination date, as intended
 in the study protocol, and 127 (85%) before the scheduled
 vaccination date (online supplemental table S4). Of
 SMS + 150 KES arm caregivers, 71% (n=105) reported that
 they received the mMoney incentive, of whom 72% (76 of
 105) owned the phone to which the mMoney incentive was
 sent. Receipt of the incentive was reported to have influ-
 enced the decision to vaccinate in 84% (88 of 105) of these
 caregivers. A little over three-­quarters of caregivers cashed
 out the incentive within 3 days of receiving the incentive.
 Among infants whose caregivers who cashed out the incen-
 tive, 19% (20 of 103) and 13% (13 of 103) did not receive
 MCV1 by age 10 months and age 12 months, respectively
 (online supplemental table S5). Approximately 95%
 of caregivers reported a positive experience related to
 receiving the incentive. Only one caregiver reported that
 they would be less likely to seek vaccination in the absence
 of an incentive. Incentives were commonly used to cover
 transport costs (n=59; 56%), housing expenses (n=21;
 20%) and to purchase food (n=16; 15%; table 4).

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> When delivered under real-­ world conditions, SMS
 reminders coupled with a small unconditional mone-
 tary incentive increased the timeliness of MCV1 receipt,
 as did SMS reminders despite not achieving statistical
 significance. However, MCV1 timely coverage was
 significantly higher in the SMS arm compared with the
 control arm in the per-­protocol analysis, suggesting that
 when delivered under ideal conditions, SMS reminders
 alone may improve MCV1 timeliness. Though the
 effect of the interventions on MCV1 timely coverage
 was modest—the findings suggested the potential to
 improve timeliness by 9%–11% points—the magnitude
 of effect could be meaningful from a policy perspec-
 tive as delay in vaccination increases the proportion
 of susceptible persons, of particular clinical concern
 in high HIV prevalence settings 32 such as this one.
 There was no evidence that the interventions exacer-
 bated or reduced inequities in MCV1 timeliness. The
 effects of the interventions on MCV1 coverage by age
 12 months were even more modest and did not achieve
 statistical significance, leaving unclear whether either

 intervention may reduce the proportion of infants not
 receiving routine MCV.
 This study was novel in that it evaluated the combined
 impact of SMS reminders and unconditional mone-
 tary incentives on vaccination timeliness and coverage.
 To our knowledge, it is the first study to evaluate the
 combined effect of those interventions. It is only the
 second study, following our previous evaluation that
 provided conditional monetary incentives, 17 to evaluate
 the impact of SMS reminders coupled with any type of
 monetary incentive on vaccination uptake; other studies
 have assessed the impact of SMS reminders 11–16 18 20 33
 and incentives separately. 35–37 Furthermore, we illustrated
 that CHVs can support community-­based identification
 of infants targeted for immunisation interventions.
 The finding from this study that SMS reminders
 coupled with an incentive significantly increase measles
 vaccination timeliness is consistent with the M-­ SIMU
 study 17 and reproduces a positive finding within the same
 study population. However, the findings also suggest
 differential impact of unconditional vs conditional incen-
 tives on MCV1 uptake. First, the magnitude of the impact
 of SMS reminders coupled with an unconditional mone-
 tary incentive on MCV1 timely coverage in this study—
 an approximately 9%–11% absolute increase—was less
 than the 21% absolute increase associated with SMS
 reminders coupled with conditional incentives in the
 M-­SIMU study. Second, the finding that the effect of SMS
 reminders coupled with an unconditional incentive was
 similar to that of SMS reminders alone was in contrast to
 findings from the M-­SIMU study where the effect of SMS
 reminders coupled with conditional incentives surpassed
 that of SMS reminders alone.
 There is mixed evidence on whether the impact of
 conditional incentives on health outcomes varies from
 that of unconditional incentives. Systematic reviews have
 found positive effects of both conditional and uncon-
 ditional financial incentives for outcomes such as HIV
 prevention and treatment and healthcare seeking. 38–40

<iend>

 Some studies have found that unconditional incentives
 improve return or response rates for health-­ related
 surveys whereas conditional incentives do not, though
 not all incentives were financial. 41–43 In terms of vacci-
 nation outcomes, evaluations of large conditional and
 unconditional cash transfer programmes in Central
 and South America found that transfers significantly
 increased uptake for some childhood vaccines but not
 for others, with neither type of cash transfer programme
 having consistent effects. 44–47 Three studies of de facto
 conditional (incentives were delivered at immunisation
 visits) non-­cash incentives in Pakistan and India found
 that the incentives significantly increased DTP3 or overall
 vaccination uptake. 22 35 37 In the one cluster randomised
 controlled trial that simultaneously assessed the impact
 of both conditional and unconditional cash transfers
 on childhood health in Zimbabwe, neither intervention
 significantly improved vaccination uptake. 48 Contrary to
 the suggestion from this study that conditional incen-
 tives had a greater effect compared with unconditional
 incentives, conditional incentives have been theorised to
 negatively impact intrinsic motivation in the behavioural
 economics literature. 49 Further research is needed to
 evaluate whether, in a setting where intrinsic motivation
 to practice the target behaviour is fairly high—in this
 setting coverage for third-­dose DTP-­containing vaccine
 was 96% (table 1)—conditional incentives may in the
 short run improve outcomes through increasing extrinsic
 motivation.
 
<section> At the same time, methodological factors (and not
 conditionality of the incentive) may explain differ-
 ences in the effects in this study compared with those
 observed previously in the M-­SIMU study. Whereas SMS
 reminders plus conditional incentives were associated
 with a statistically significant 6% absolute increase in
 MCV1 coverage by age 12 months in the M-­SIMU study,
 the 7% absolute increase in the SMS + 150 KES arm
 of this study was not statistically significant. However,
 this study was underpowered to detect the observed
 increase, as we assumed an absolute increase in MCV1
 timely coverage of ≥15% in sample size calculations. To
 be sufficiently powered to detect the approximately 7%
 absolute increase in MCV1 coverage by age 12 months
 observed, a sample size of approximately 593 indi-
 viduals in each study arm would have been required.
 Second, the incentive amount and nature of the incen-
 tive differed in this study compared with the M-­SIMU
 study. The incentive amount in this study was KES
 150 (~US$1.87 in August 2015; indexed to 2015 KES)
 compared with KES 200 (~US$2.35 in August 2015;
 indexed to 2015 KES) in the M-­SIMU study. Further-
 more, in this study, caregivers received a maximum
 monetary incentive of KES 150 compared with as much
 as KES 800 in the M-­SIMU study as that study incen-
 tivised the pentavalent vaccine primary series in addi-
 tion to MCV1. 17 The higher incentive amount in the
 M-­SIMU study may have been more motivating to care-
 givers given that the value of incentives is thought to

 be positively correlated to their effect. 49 Furthermore,
 formative research for the M-­SIMU study found that
 93% of caregivers felt that KES 200 would motivate
 prioritising attending a vaccination visit compared with
 83% for KES 150 (D. Gibson personal communica-
 tion). Finally, the repeated vaccination prompts during
 the M-­SIMU study (SMS reminders for the pentavalent
 series and MCV1) may have induced greater vaccine
 seeking among those caregivers as more frequent
 reminders may be associated with greater impact.
 Beyond research design, a nationwide nurses’ strike
 that began on 5 June 2017 51 and was ongoing at the time
 of study completion, represented an unexpected supply-­
 side barrier to vaccination which may have affected the
 study findings. Approximately three-­quarters and one-­
 third of the analytic sample reached 10 months of age
 and 12 months of age, respectively, before the strike
 began. We observed that the 78% MCV1 coverage esti-
 mate in the Control arm was lower than the expected
 83%–84% coverage based on previous estimates of
 coverage in the study area 17 31 and in Siaya County.
 Exclusion of infants that had received a dose of MCV
 prior to reaching age 9 months would not explain the
 discrepancy; had they been enrolled and followed up
 (a conservative assumption), Control MCV1 coverage
 would have been ~80%. Although MCV1 coverage was
 not significantly higher in intervention infants who
 reached age 12 months before the strike compared
 with control infants who also reached age 12 months
 before the strike (online supplemental table S6), in
 theory, the nurses’ strike may have reduced the poten-
 tial impact of interventions if intervention arm care-
 givers seeking MCV1 in public health facilities were
 unable to get their infants vaccinated as a result of the
 strike. Of note, estimates of MCV1 timely coverage and
 coverage by age 12 months in the intervention arms in
 the period before the nurses’ strike were comparable
 (online supplemental table S6).
 This study has several limitations. First, the analytic
 sample comprised 85% of enrolled participants.
 Excluded infants were more likely to be firstborn chil-
 dren and to have mothers aged 25 years or less. Similar
 patterns were observed previously and are attributed to
 cultural practices around pregnancy and birth whereby
 mothers return to their rural home to receive support
 caring for newly-­born infants. 17 Firstborn infants and
 children of younger mothers are thought to be less
 at risk of being unvaccinated or receiving vaccination
 with delay than later-­born infants and children of older
 mothers, respectively. 31 53–56 Thus, the effect estimates
 may have been biased towards the null. Another limita-
 tion of this study is that only 85% of SMS reminders and
 61% of mMoney incentives were sent out as intended
 which may have biased the effect toward the null.
 Indeed, the per-­protocol analysis but not the ITT anal-
 ysis found SMS reminders significantly improved MCV1
 timeliness. Delivery of SMS reminders was hampered
 mainly by power outages; therefore, the findings may
 provide some insight into the real-­world effectiveness of
 SMS reminders when delivered within a programmatic
 setting likely to experience similar challenges. mMoney
 incentives were delayed because they were sent out
 manually by study staff during weekdays but not on
 weekends when staff were not working. In post hoc anal-
 yses, delayed delivery of the incentive did not impact
 MCV1 timely coverage (online supplemental tables S7
 and S8). A related limitation is that≥20% of caregivers
 may not have received the interventions, based on self-­
 report. If true, the observed effects would be biased
 towards the null. We did not have objective mecha-
 nisms to verify intervention receipt and self-­report was
 susceptible to recall bias as we asked caregivers whether
 they had received the interventions about 3 months
 after they had been sent. Besides recall bias, reported
 receipt of interventions may have been influenced by
 phone ownership, whereby caregivers who owned a
 phone may have been more likely to remember having
 received the intervention compared with those sharing
 the phone to which interventions were sent. Curi-
 ously, the proportion of SMS + 150 KES caregivers who
 reported receiving SMS reminders was higher than the
 proportion who reported receiving the incentive. This
 could perhaps be explained if SMS messages were more
 likely to be passed along than the incentive for SMS +
 150 KES caregivers who shared a phone. An additional
 limitation of this study is that COMM-­Is, who collected
 measles vaccination status at the follow-­up visit, were
 responsible for assigning the study arm at enrolment
 and were therefore not blinded to study arm alloca-
 tion. We think ascertainment bias is unlikely because
 follow-­up occurred 4–6 months from enrolment and
 we structured the follow-­ up questionnaire to collect 
<section> vaccination data prior to any questions that identified
 the study arm allocation. Repeat follow-­up interviews by
 the study’s field supervisor support this; of the 5% that
 was reinterviewed, only one vaccination discrepancy
 
<section> was found.
 
<section> CONCLUSION
 
<section> This study’s findings suggest that the impact of SMS
 reminders coupled with a small unconditional mone-
 tary incentive on MCV1 timeliness was comparable
 to that of SMS reminders alone, yet it would be more
 costly to implement. In addition, the impact of SMS
 reminders coupled with small unconditional incentives
 on reducing the proportion of measles-­unvaccinated
 infants was unclear, though the findings suggest that
 any effect is likely to be modest and of similar magni-
 tude to that of SMS reminders alone. Notably, the
 similarity in MCV1 uptake levels among infants in the
 intervention arms was observed even before the nurses’
 strike and other supply-­ side constraints observed in
 the study are likely to be experienced under real-­world
 conditions in LMICs. Additional studies in the absence
 of unexpected supply-­ side constraints, such as the
 nurses’ strike, are needed to inform the generalisability
 
<section> of the findings.
