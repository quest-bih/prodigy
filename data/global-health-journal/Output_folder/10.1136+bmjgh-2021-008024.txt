<section> ABSTRACT
 
<section> Objective To estimate scent dogs’ diagnostic accuracy
 in identification of people infected with SARS-­CoV-­2 in
 comparison with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
 reaction (RT-­PCR). We conducted a randomised triple-­blinded
 validation trial, and a real-­life study at the Helsinki-­Vantaa
 International Airport, Finland.
 
<section> Methods Four dogs were trained to detect COVID-­19
 using skin swabs from individuals tested for SARS-­CoV-­2
 by RT-­PCR. Our controlled triple-­blinded validation study
 comprised four identical sets of 420 parallel samples
 (from 114 individuals tested positive and 306 negative
 by RT-­PCR), randomly presented to each dog over seven
 trial sessions. In a real-­life setting the dogs screened skin
 swabs from 303 incoming passengers all concomitantly
 examined by nasal swab SARS-­CoV-­2 RT-­PCR. Our
 main outcomes were variables of diagnostic accuracy
 (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative
 predictive value) for scent dog identification in comparison
 with RT-­PCR.
 
<section> Results Our validation experiments had an overall
 accuracy of 92% (95% CI 90% to 93%), a sensitivity
 of 92% (95% CI 89% to 94%) and a specificity of 91%
 (95% CI 89% to 93%) compared with RT-­PCR. For our
 dogs, trained using the wild-­type virus, performance was
 less accurate for the alpha variant (89% for confirmed
 wild-­type vs 36% for alpha variant, OR 14.0, 95% CI 4.5
 to 43.4). In the real-­life setting, scent detection and RT-­
 PCR matched 98.7% of the negative swabs. Scant airport
 prevalence (0.47%) did not allow sensitivity testing; our
 only SARS-­CoV-­2 positive swab was not identified (alpha
 variant). However, ad hoc analysis including predefined
 positive spike samples showed a total accuracy of 98%
 (95% CI 97% to 99%).
 
<section> Conclusions This large randomised controlled triple-­
 blinded validation study with a precalculated sample size
 conducted at an international airport showed that trained
 scent dogs screen airport passenger samples with high
 accuracy. One of our findings highlights the importance
 of continuous retraining as new variants emerge. Using
 scent dogs may present a valuable approach for high-­
 throughput, rapid screening of large numbers of people.

<section> INTRODUCTION
 Containment of the COVID-­ 19 pandemic
 necessitates rapid large-­scale identification of
 infected individuals. Most patients with SARS-­
 CoV-­ 2 disease are either asymptomatic or
 have only mild symptoms, but can be conta-
 gious. 1 The test-­and-­isolate strategy has largely
 relied on the modern reverse transcriptase-­
 polymerase chain reaction (RT-­ PCR) tech-
 nique. Its practicality is hampered by inade-
 quate availability, restricted testing capacity,
 high costs, long turnaround time, and
 prolonged positivity after infection. 2 3 Rapid

 screening methods, such as antigen tests are already in
 use. 4 A fascinating screening strategy consists of detec-
 tion by trained scent dogs, an approach not confined to
 laboratories, enabling large sample numbers with results
 in real time. 5
 Dogs have an extremely sensitive olfactory system: their
 limit of detection reaches as low as one part per trillion
 concentrations, 7 exceeding the instruments currently
 available. 8 Dogs are presumed to detect distinct volatile
 organic compounds (VOCs) 9 released by their hosts’
 metabolic processes in various conditions. 5 Indeed, dogs
 have been reported to identify distinct VOCs elicited by
 various bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. 10–12
 During the current pandemic, scent detection dogs
 have been trained to identify samples from hospital-
 ised patients with COVID-­19 13–17 (online supplemental
 table 1). The preliminary data suggest that dogs can be
 trained within weeks to detect samples from SARS-­CoV-­2-­
 infected individuals with an accuracy comparable to stan-
 dard RT-­PCR. However, stronger evidence is needed with
 power calculated sample sizes, better defined control
 groups, and above all, randomised double/triple-­blinded
 research designs including previously unsniffed samples
 from the actual target population, outpatients. While
 proof-­of-­concept studies have been encouraging, scent
 dogs need to be taken from laboratory settings to real-­life
 conditions.
 The scent dog approach appears particularly appealing
 for screening SARS-­CoV-­2-­infected individuals in public
 places and among masses of travellers at airports and
 harbours. In the spring 2020, we started training dogs to
 see whether they could identify samples from SARS-­CoV-­
 2-­infected individuals and, in the autumn, started oper-
 ational scent work at the Helsinki-­Vantaa International
 Airport. Here, we present the results of a three-­faceted
 study comprising (1) the dogs’ training, (2) a prospec-
 tive, randomised triple-­blind validation study using four
 dogs and (3) a real-­life prospective study using the same
 dogs in daily screening of incoming passengers at the
 airport, comprising a simultaneous scent detection dog
 test and nasopharyngeal SARS-­CoV-­2 RT-­PCR.
 
<section> METHODS
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> We explored whether scent dogs can be trained to iden-
 tify humans with SARS-­CoV-­2 infection. The study was
 conducted at the scent detection dog training centre Wise
 Nose, Vantaa, Finland; University of Helsinki, Finland
 (Veterinary Faculty and Departments of Equine and
 Small Animal Medicine and Veterinary Biosciences and
 the DogRisk/Helsinki One Health and Medical Faculty,
 Department of Virology) and Meilahti Vaccine Research
 Centre, MeVac and Helsinki University Hospital Labora-
 tory (HUSLAB), Helsinki University Hospital (HUH),
 Finland.
 At the Helsinki-­ Vantaa International Airport, the
 study was conducted in a specifically designed cubicle
 (figure 1A) built at the arrivals terminal. The cubicle
 setting was used in the dogs’ final training, in the valida-
 tion and as an area where the dogs screened incoming
 travellers in the real-­life study. The cubicle had three
 sampling rooms for passengers’ skin swab sampling
 (figure 1B), a working area for the dogs and sliding
 hatches on walls for samples and tracks (figure 1C).
 
<section> Patient and public involvement
 The participants were recruited from among the
 following groups: (1) inpatients in HUH, (2) outpatients
 and healthy individuals who were contacted by telephone
 or who contacted the study team in response to adver-
 tisements posted at PCR testing stations around Helsinki
 and (3) incoming flight passengers and personnel at
 Helsinki-­Vantaa International Airport. For all inpatients
 and outpatients, a recent RT-­PCR result was available at
 the time of recruitment. At the airport, recruited passen-
 gers were tested concomitantly by RT-­PCR and a scent
 detection dog. Those with a pretravel negative RT-­PCR
 test less than 72 hours old were not retested. For inclu-
 sion of airport employees, a RT-­PCR test result within
 hours was required.
 All the volunteers gave written informed consent. They
 completed questionnaires on demographics, symptoms
 and PCR test results. If their results were not available at
 the time of form filling, these were obtained later. In addi-
 tion, electronic medical records of hospitalised patients
 and personal interviews were used, when needed.
 Individuals with incomplete questionnaires and/or
 non-­availability of RT-­PCR results were excluded. There
 were no restrictions of age, sex, nationality or concur-
 rent diseases. In addition, samples from individuals

<iend>

 with asymptomatic or typical COVID-­19 symptoms were
 included in all three arms of the study.
 
<section> Skin swab sampling and specimen handling
 All volunteers collected the skin swabs themselves using
 a sterile package containing five gauze eight ply swabs
 (Mölnlycke Healthcare AB, Göteborg, Sweden). They
 were instructed to separate the layers of the gauze and use
 a single layer to swab the skin of their neck, throat area,
 forehead, and wrists. They swabbed 5–20 gauze samples
 and, to avoid evaporation and cross-­ contamination
 during storage, they placed them in the smallest of three
 plastic zip lock bags (volumes 0.5 L, 1 L and 2 L) each of
 which they placed inside the next, larger one (Minigrip;
 Suominen Joustopakkaukset Oy, Ikaalinen, Finland).
 The outpatient samples to be used in the training, vali-
 dation and as spike samples in the real-­life cohort were
 collected from the volunteers at their homes shortly after
 their RT-­PCR tests. The courier left the sampling kit at
 the front door, and after sampling, returned the samples
 to the dog training facility. All samples, positive and
 negative samples separated, were stored in plastic boxes
 (Smart Store; Orthex Sweden AB, Tingsryd, Sweden) in
 a dark place at 21°C–23°C until used. Samples with an
 unknown infection status were stored separately until the
 status was confirmed. The storage time for the validation
 samples was 0–5 months.
 At the airport, in the sampling room (figure 1B), the
 gauze swab was placed in a 1 L plastic freezer bag (Pirkka;
 HP Rani Plast Ab, Teerijärvi, Finland) and then placed
 inside a metallic stainless steel can (85 mm high and
 70 mm in diameter). Four extra swabbed gauze samples
 were placed in a 0.5 L plastic zip lock bag (Minigrip;
 Suominen Joustopakkaukset Oy, Ikaalinen, Finland),
 enclosed in a 1 L zip lock bag and stored as previously
 described.
 For each validation session, the scent tracks with samples
 were prepared in a separate location at the airport on
 the validation day. Sixty cans were prepared for each dog
 as follows: The zip lock bag containing the sample was
 opened, and a single gauze was transferred with sterile
 metallic tweezers into a can lined with a 1 L plastic freezer
 bag. To avoid sample odour contamination, the positive
 and negative samples were prepared on separate tables.
 The cans were loaded onto the scent tracks according to
 a computer-­generated randomisation list, and a trolley
 with the tracks transported to the cubicle.
 The study team used adequate personal protective
 equipment, including a mask and powder-­ free nitrile
 gloves, when handling the study specimens.
 
<section> Confirmation of a COVID-19 diagnosis
 A COVID-­19 diagnosis was based on a positive RT-­PCR of
 a nasopharyngeal swab. Discrepancies in the validation
 results (at least two dogs giving a response different from
 that of the RT-­PCR test) and in the real-­life study were
 resolved by serum SARS-­ CoV-­ 2 antibody test analysed
 by nucleocapsid protein and Spike IgG enzyme immu-
 noassays, as described previously. 18 When serum samples
 could not be obtained, viral load, symptoms and informa-
 tion about SARS-­CoV-­2 exposure were used to estimate
 the infection status.
 The variant status of SARS-­CoV-­2 was determined by the
 SYNLAB for Diagnostics Centre of the Hospital District
 of Helsinki using data of S gene target failure (SGTF)
 for the alpha variant, HUSLAB using TaqPath COVID-­19
 PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts,
 USA) and TipMolBiol (Berlin, Germany) using N501Y
 mutation RT-­PCR, which detects alpha or beta variants.
 The initial RT-­PCR samples were subjected to genomic
 sequencing and bioinformatics analysis as previously
 described. 19 Based on epidemiological data, 20 all samples
 obtained before 6 January 2020 were considered ‘wild-­
 type,’ with reference to the D614G Wuhan-­like strain.

<section> All the dogs included in this study had previous experi-
 ence of scent work (table 1).
 
<section> Part I: Dog training
 The initial training, aiming to provide the dogs with a
 clear scent picture of COVID-­ 19, was carried out by
 skilled canine scent detection trainers using operant
 conditioning, with a clicker and treats used for positive
 reinforcement. In brief, first, the dogs were exposed to
 cans containing positive samples and taught to indicate
 a can with a positive sample. Second, they were intro-
 duced to a negative sample in parallel with a positive
 sample to allow scent discrimination. Third, the number
 of negative and positive samples was increased in the
 scent track to reinforce discrimination between positive

 and negative samples. Finally, confounding samples,
 including samples obtained from volunteers with other
 respiratory and viral diseases and samples from children,
 seniors or individuals with underlying diseases, such as
 asthma or allergies, cancer or diabetes, were introduced
 as controls. Once the dog and dog handler pair achieved
 a success rate of higher than 80% in detecting SARS-­
 CoV-­2 positive samples, the dog continued its training
 at Helsinki-­Vantaa International Airport in the purpose-­
 built working cubicle described earlier (figure 1A–D).
 The training was performed during a period when novel
 virus variants had not yet emerged in Finland.
 The training was conducted using two different types of
 purpose-­built metallic scent tracks each with either five or
 nine holes for the cans and/or triangular shaped metallic
 single can-­holders. Cans used for positive samples were
 not mixed with cans used for negative samples. The cans
 and can-­holders were washed in an industrial dishwasher
 at a temperature of around ° C between every exercise.
 
<section> Part II: Triple-blinded validation study at Helsinki-Vantaa
 
<section> International Airport
 The validation study was conducted according to the
 Helsinki University triple-­ blind validation protocol, as
 described in detail in the online supplemental notes; for
 the design and execution see figure 2. In total, six inves-
 tigators and one external controller were present at all
 validation sessions. Prior to the first validation day, the
 validation team and the dogs were familiarised with the
 study conditions and the protocol in a rehearsal session
 identical to a validation session, here also introducing
 60 novel samples. This was followed by seven validation
 sessions (VAL1–7). In these sessions, four parallel samples
 from the 420 individuals were randomised (samples:
 n=1680; dogs: n=4) into tracks of three samples, with
 20 tracks in each of the seven sessions. Thus, each dog
 was exposed to 140 scent tracks. To allow comparisons
 between dogs, all four dogs received an identical set of
 samples. Thus, each parallel sample was used only once
 and for only one dog. The samples were assigned to
 the sessions (VAL1–7) in chronological order, the ones
 collected first in the VAL1 session and last in the VAL7
 session. The order of the sessions was different for each
 dog. The dates of the sample collection and the order
 of the validation sessions per dog are shown in online
 supplemental table 2).
 The dogs were rewarded for each positive result imme-
 diately after the correct indication. If a dog immediately
 selected the positive sample and skipped sniffing the
 other samples, the result was still recorded as successful.
 The validation stage of the study was recorded using
 four cameras set up at different angles. A retired police
 sergeant from the Finnish K-­ 9 police dog school was
 present during all the validation sessions as an external
 controller, confirming that the validations followed the
 predetermined protocol.
 
<section> Part III: Real-life cohort
 The operational activity at Helsinki-­Vantaa International
 Airport took place between 23 September 2020 and 30
 April 2021. In total, 10 119 travellers (83.2%) and airport
 employees (16.8%) took part in the scent detection dog
 test, resulting in 48 (0.47%) samples indicated as posi-
 tive. Part of these were recruited to the validation or the
 real-­life study.
 For collection of the skin swabs, see description above.
 The can with the sample was passed through a hatch to
 an assistant in the dogs’ working space (figure 1C). The
 dog handler then placed the can in the five-­hole scent
 track, together with a variable number of control samples
 (figure 1D). The dog handler interpreted the dog’s
 indications as positive or negative for SARS-­CoV-­2 and a
 written test result was given to the participant.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 The power calculation suggested a minimum of
 RT-­ PCR positive and 108 negative samples to achieve
 sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of 90%. This sample
 size was expected to have an 80% probability of obtaining
 an estimated Se and Sp of which the lower bound of the
 95% CI would be greater than the minimal value of 80%
 (calculated using https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/​
 ssize/b1.html).
 Se and Sp were calculated according to Trevethan.
 To cover incidences where the dogs directly marked a
 positive sample and skipped sniffing one or both of the
 other samples in the same track, Se and Sp were calcu-
 lated using two separate methods. First, we calculated the 
<section> Se and Sp only for those samples the dogs truly sniffed
 (Se and Sp ). Second, we calculated the Se and Sp
 
<section> sniff sniff
 for all the samples (Se and Sp ). In this approach, we
 
<section> all all
 assumed that the dogs considered all unsniffed samples
 negative, as they left them untouched. Positive predic-
 tive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs)
 were calculated based on our data and on hypothetical
 prevalence scenarios : 40% reflecting a high preva-
 lence setting such as a pandemic time hospital, and 1%
 reflecting a low prevalence setting such as an airport.
 We also investigated whether some epidemiological/
 clinical variables were possibly associated with failure
 to identify positive samples. To do so, we restricted the
 calculations to include only positive samples. Positive
 samples were defined as a true positive (TP) if all four
 dogs correctly marked them, and as a false negative (FN)
 if even a single dog did not mark the sample. The candi-
 date variables potentially associated with the outcome
 (FN) were: age, gender, concurrent chronic diseases
 (asthma, allergy, cancer, diabetes, migraine), presence of
 typical COVID-­19 symptoms, duration of symptoms (time
 in days between symptom onset and sample collections),
 time between RT-­PCR test and sample collection and type
 of virus (wild type vs alpha variant). Univariate logistic
 regression models were performed and ORs with their
 corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were
 provided. For quantitative variables (such as age, duration
 of symptoms and time between RT-­PCR test and sample
 collection), the linearity of the association was investi-
 gated using restricted cubic spline (RCS) functions with
 three knots located at the 5th, 50th, and 95th centiles of

 outcome (on the log scale) was not considered as linear,
 the quantitative variable was included in the model with
 the RCS functions, and ORs were provided for arbitrary
 values. Because of the low number of FN samples, multi-
 variate models could not be performed. However, in
 order to rule out the possible confounding effects of the
 candidate variables, bivariate logistic regression models
 were performed, exploring one by one each candidate
 variable as a potential confounder together with the vari-
 able of interest. ORs were considered significant (type-­I
 error set at 0.05) when their corresponding 95% CI did
 not include the number 1. To obtain Se and Sp values for
 wild-­type only samples, we used for calculations VAL1–2
 (where no alpha variants had yet emerged). SAS Univer-
 sity Edition (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina,
 USA) was used for the statistical data analysis.

 before starting operational work, the dogs were further
 coached in the purpose-­ built cubicle at the Helsinki-­
 Vantaa International Airport (figure 1).
 
<section> Part II: Validation
 For the validation study, we selected the four dogs
 working at the airport during the study period. The
 conduct followed the detailed Helsinki University Scent
 detection validation protocol (online supplemental
 notes). Each dog was presented with an identical set of
 420 parallel novel randomised samples, including
 positives (27%) and 306 negatives (73%; table 2), in
 fixed three-­sample tracks, provided over seven validation
 trial sessions (VAL1–7). Of the 140 tracks, 26 (18.6%)
 were randomised as not containing positive samples. The
 session and track order were not disclosed to personnel
 and varied by dog.
 Overall, the diagnostic accuracy of all samples sniffed
 was 92% (95% CI 90% to 93%). The combined sensi-
 tivity Se and specificity Sp for all four dogs was 92%

 (for unsniffed samples and positive and negative predic-

 between the dogs: the best performance reached 93%
 (95% CI 85% to 96%) for Se and 95% (91% to 97%) for

 Se 99% (96% to 100%) and the Sp 96% (93% to 98%).
 The figures for each dog’s individual validation session
 are provided in online supplemental table 2).
 Discrepancies (at least two dogs’ results differing from
 the RT-­PCR) were observed for 19/420 samples (table 4),
 79% of them in VAL6–7, with samples gathered in late
 February–March 2021. Eight of the 19 samples were
 RT-­ PCR positive. Our re-­ evaluation of sample status
 (based on RT-­ PCR viral load, symptoms, time since
 symptom onset and antibody data) confirmed all these
 eight as SARS-­CoV-­2 positive, of which six were alpha
 variants, one not known, and one was wild-­type. Of the
 11 RT-­PCR negative samples detected as positive by the
 dogs, six were confirmed as SARS-­CoV-­2 negative, four as
 uncertain and one as a possible positive.
 Based on the prevalence rate of COVID-­19 positive samples
 in our data (27%), the overall PPV and NPV were 83.9%
 (95% CI 80.8% to 86.7%) and 95.8% (94.4% to 96.9%),
 respectively (table 3). In a population with 40% prevalence,
 the PPV and NPV were calculated as 87.8% (95% CI 85.3%
 to 90.0%) and 94.4% (92.4% to 95.8%), respectively. In a
 population with a prevalence of 1% the PPV and NPV were
 9.8% (8.1% to 12.0%) and 99.91% (99.88% to 99.93%),
 respectively.
 Of the 114 positive COVID-­19 samples, 30 were FN and
 84 were TP. Failure to identify a COVID-­19 positive sample
 was associated with the SARS-­CoV-­2 variant status (alpha vs
 wild-­type; OR=14.0; 95% CI, 4.5 to 43.4; table 5): the dogs
 indicated correctly 89% of the confirmed wild-­type samples
 but only 36% of the alpha variant samples. Based on the OR
 values with the 95% CI, gender, concurrent chronic disease,
 time between start of symptoms and sampling, time since
 PCR test and increasing age of patients were found not to
 be associated with failure to identify a COVID-­19 positive
 samples (table 5). None of the ORs presented in table 5 were
 modified in bivariate analyses (data not shown).
 
<section> Part III: Real-life cohort
 The dog identification and the RT-­PCR result matched for
 296/303 (97.7%) of the real-­life samples of incoming passen-
 gers. The dogs correctly identified the samples as negative for
 296/300 (98.7%) RT-­PCR negative swabs. Table 6 provides
 details of the seven discrepant results. The dogs indicated
 three RT-­PCR positive cases as negative. After re-­evaluation
 with clinical and serological data, one was judged as SARS-­
 CoV-­2 negative, one as SARS-­CoV-­2 positive and one as a
 likely postinfectious positive RT-­ PCR result. Similarly, the
 dogs indicated four RT-­PCR negative cases as positive. These
 were all judged as SARS-­CoV-­2 negative.
 To maintain the dogs’ screening skills in this low preva-
 lence (0.47%) setting, a total of 155 novel RT-­PCR positive
 ‘spike’ samples were provided to the dogs during working
 days (online supplemental table 3). They correctly indicated
 98.7% of them as positive. Had the spike samples been calcu-
 lated as part of the real-­life study, the dogs’ performance

<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> Our study demonstrates that, in comparison with RT-­PCR,
 scent detection dogs can be trained to identify SARS-­CoV-­
 2-­infected individuals from skin swab samples with high
 diagnostic accuracy. In our real-­life setting with a very
 low prevalence, the performance in identifying negative
 samples was very good (98.7%). Unfortunately, because
 of a low number of confirmed positive cases, accuracy
 with respect to positive samples could not be reliably
 assessed. However, ad hoc analysis also calculating the
 positive spike swabs showed a real-­life performance of
 98.5% for detecting positive samples. Below we discuss
 separately each of the three parts of the study.
 
<section> Part I: Training of dogs
 To keep the training short, we used dogs with previous scent
 work experience. Unlike studies conducted only in labo-
 ratory settings, 13–17 we included two phases: initial training
 at a training centre, and—once the dogs were qualified—
 training in a challenging environment (Helsinki-­ Vantaa
 International Airport). Only one of nine dogs did not show
 high motivation for working in the test cubicle.
 
<section> Part II: Validation test
 Our validation experiment showed a high diagnostic
 accuracy with 92% sensitivity and 91% specificity.
 Several previous studies suggest that scent dogs can
 distinguish between samples from SARS-­CoV-­2-­infected
 and uninfected individuals (reviewed in online supple-
 mental table 1). However, although they demonstrate

<section> the dogs’ diagnostic accuracy, these previous proof-­of-­
 concept studies 13–17 had some limitations: small samples
 sizes, 13 16 17 repeated use of the same samples, 15 use of
 inactivated samples, 13 14 16 use of empty cans or clean
 gauze swabs as controls 15 16 and conducting validation
 tests only in laboratory settings. 13–17 Perhaps even more
 importantly, in those studies almost all samples were
 collected from hospitals, 13 15–17 failing to cover the actual
 target population, outpatients. Alternatively, positive
 samples were from hospitals and controls from outside
 hospitals—potentially misleading the dogs to identify
 hospital-­associated odours as positive cues. Indeed, scent
 dog guidelines advise to watch out for systematic differ-
 ences between positive and control samples. 25 Apart from
 these published proof-­ of-­ concept studies, some non-­
 peer reviewed preprints provide further data : Guest
 et al collected 400 odour samples from patients with
 asymptomatic or mild COVID-­19 and demonstrated in
 a randomised double-­blind trial under laboratory condi-
 tions with six dogs a sensitivity range of 82%–94% and a
 specificity range of 76%–92%.
 Based on the overall Se and Sp (92% and 91%, respec-
 tively), we calculated PPV and NPV according to two
 infection probability scenarios reflecting the prevalence
 of 40% and 1%. For a population with a prevalence of
 40%, we estimated a PPV of 87.8% and a NPV of 94.4%.
 This means that the information provided by the dog
 (marking or not marking) increases the chances of detec-
 tion to around 90%. For a population with a prevalence
 of 1%, by contrast, we estimated a PPV of 9.8% and an
 NPV of 99.9%. In both scenarios, high NPV supports
 the use of dogs for screening to exclude individuals not
 needing RT-­PCR. We therefore suggest that dogs could
 be used both in sites of high SARS-­CoV-­2 prevalence,
 such as hospitals (to prescreen patients and personnel),
 as well as in low prevalence sites such as airports or ports
 (to prescreen passengers). Such prescreening could save
 considerably both time and PCR testing resources.
 Our study design overcomes some of the major limita-
 tions of the previous studies: our sample size was based
 on a power calculation, our validation experiment was
 conducted outside laboratory conditions and our samples
 were collected in a random fashion as four parallel swabs,
 each used only once. We collected positive and nega-
 tive swabs from both asymptomatic and symptomatic
 outpatients, children and seniors, and those with non-­
 communicable diseases, and included samples collected
 during early and late phases of the disease. Unlike the
 previous validation studies, we randomly included tracks
 with no positive samples. This mimics better the real-­life
 situation in low-­prevalence settings.
 In univariate analysis, the only variable strongly associ-
 ated with failure to identify COVID-­19 positive samples
 was the alpha variant (table 5). Indeed, according with
 the epidemiological situation in our country, 20 the virus
 variants started to emerge only at the end of our valida-
 tion sample collection period, with 59% of the positive
 samples in VAL6–7 confirmed to represent virus variants
 (mostly alpha) and only 3% the wild-­type virus (the virus
 type of the others remained unknown). Importantly, the
 dogs had only been trained to detect samples of patients
 infected by the wild-­type virus. The emergence of the new
 variants presumably explains the less successful perfor-
 mance by the dogs towards the end of the study period.
 In the bivariate analyses, after adjustment for all other
 variables possibly associated with the dogs’ performance,
 the association between variant type and detection failure
 remained as strong as in the univariate analysis. Naturally,
 we cannot rule out confounding effects of other variables
 than the ones we investigated. Interestingly, Guest et al
 also had a small amount of alpha variant samples in their
 dataset. Their dogs correctly identified 38/48 (79%)
 of the alpha variant samples, the rate remaining lower
 than for the wild-­type virus. 26 The difference was not
 significant, yet as their study was not designed to inves-
 tigate the variants, it might have lacked statistical power.
 In our investigation the difference was highly signif-
 icant according to the OR and its 95% CI, as the dogs
 correctly indicated 55/62 (89%) of the confirmed wild-­
 type samples, but only 9/25 (36%) of the alpha variant
 samples. Thus, while the dogs indicated the alpha variant
 samples, their performance was lower than with the wild-­
 type virus. Indeed, this observation is remarkable as it
 proves the scent dogs’ robust discriminatory power. The
 obvious implication is that training samples should cover
 all epidemiologically relevant variants. Our preliminary
 observations suggest that dogs primed with one virus type
 can in a few hours be retrained to detect its variants (data
 not shown).
 Another aspect to discuss is the low number of asymp-
 tomatic sample donors, which could have hampered the
 evaluation of the scent dogs’ performance with samples
 from such individuals. In fact, the performance related
 to asymptomatic subjects is of particular importance,
 since in a real-­ world screening most individuals are
 asymptomatic. However, as we collected four samples
 from each of the sample donors, we ended up with
 tests with samples from asymptomatic individuals. Only
 one was incorrectly identified as negative and two were
 left unsniffed. Thus 25/28 (89.3%) were correctly identi-
 fied as positive. In our analysis lack of symptoms was not
 associated with poorer performance.
 Finally, since dogs may become tired or unfocused
 when working long hours, we ran the validation tests
 randomly in varying order over seven working days
 for each dog. Like in previous studies, 14 15 all dogs did
 not perform equally. The differences were surprisingly
 small, however, particularly considering that the dog
 with the lowest results, E.T, was diagnosed with parotitis
 during her validation study, yet also her less successful
 days prior to diagnosis were included in her data. The
 low inter-­ dog variability observed in our study origi-
 nates most probably from the consistent high-­quality
 training performed both in the training centre and at
 the airport. 
<section> Part III: real-life air passenger study
 While the validation experiment was successful, the real-­
 life study at the airport met with some adversity. Although
 the dogs identified 98.7% of the negative samples as
 negative, they indicated four RT-­PCR negatives as posi-
 tives and did not identify three RT-­PCR positive cases.
 Re-­evaluations (the time span between symptom onset
 and sampling for RT-­PCR, clinical symptoms, viral loads
 as cycle threshold counts and SARS-­CoV-­2 antibodies) of
 the RT-­PCR positive cases suggested, however, that only
 one of the three represented the targeted group of early
 and potentially infectious cases. One of the RT-­PCR posi-
 tive individuals failed to seroconvert, suggesting a false-­
 positive RT-­PCR result. The samples of another three
 RT-­PCR positive individuals had been collected as late
 as 10 days after symptom onset, presumably indicating a
 postinfectious positive RT-­PCR result. Interestingly, the
 virus in the single verified case was identified as an alpha
 variant, possibly reflecting the dogs’ lower sensitivity to
 detect it.
 A major difference between the real-­life and validation
 studies was seen in the rate of positive samples, which
 was over 50-­fold lower in the real-­life study than in vali-
 dation (0.47% vs 27% of all samples)—that is, the dogs
 would have got only one positive sample to sniff each
 week at the most. Anticipating a low prevalence, the
 dogs’ skills were kept up by providing them with a total
 of 155 novel (not sniffed by any dog), positive ‘spike’
 samples over their shifts. Had these spike samples been
 included in the real-­life study, the prevalence would have
 been 34%, not differing from that in the validation study,
 thus confirming the methods’ potential for screening
 SARS-­CoV-­2 carriers. Similarly to any other diagnostic
 or screening tests, positive controls are needed to vali-
 date their accuracy. With the dogs, these spike samples
 serve as controls and also act as rewards, reinforcing the
 detection. In a low-­prevalence setting, the use of spike
 samples needs to be preplanned before implementing
 scent dogs in the operational work. Of note, collection of
 spike samples from patients may no longer be needed in
 the future, as preliminary data suggest that spike material
 can be produced in the laboratory.
 
<section> Limitations of the study
 Some limitations deserve to be discussed. First, scent
 dogs previously trained to detect other substances such
 as drugs may also mark them, and the dog handler may
 record the marking falsely as positive for COVID-­19. In
 this study, samples with false indications were not studied
 for narcotics and dangerous goods—that is, odours with
 which the three dogs were previously familiar.
 Second, the age of the samples varied. The samples
 used in training and validation, as well as the ‘spike’
 samples were older than in the real-­life study, for they
 had to be verified before use: in the real-­life operational
 setting, the samples were freshly collected and immedi-
 ately presented to the dogs. We acknowledge that storage
 might have affected the VOCs. 28 Further studies have
 been started to determine the precise nature of COVID-­
 19-­specific VOCs.
 Third, the validation test also had some limitations.
 The low number of positive samples available led to a lack
 of tracks with multiple positive samples. This should not
 have had any greater effect on the results, as the dogs had
 practised both with blank tracks and tracks with multiple
 positive samples.
 Finally, since variants did not emerge in Finland at
 the time of training, only wild-­type samples were used.
 Many of the discrepant results were associated with the
 new variant. In the future, operational work skills should
 be kept up by simultaneous training with samples of
 emerging virus variants. Fortunately, once the dogs have
 received the basic training, retraining to cover new vari-
 ants is expected to be easy as discussed above.
 
<section> CONCLUSION
 Employing a triple-­ blinded validation study setup, we
 provided evidence that trained scent dogs can master
 detection of samples from individuals infected with
 SARS-­CoV-­2 with good diagnostic accuracy. Interestingly,
 trained using samples only from individuals who had
 contracted the wild-­type virus, the dogs’ performance
 declined with samples of the variant era. We also provided
 some evidence that dogs can be trained to work at an
 international airport where large-­scale rapid screening of
 crowds in a short period of time is required. In the real-­
 life setting, we verified the results from our validation
 study for negative samples, but the dogs’ ability to detect
 positive samples could not be confirmed owing to low
 prevalence of positive individuals. Ad hoc analysis also
 taking into account the positive spike samples, however,
 yielded convincing accuracy among the real-­life cohort.
