<section> Manuscript
 
<section> We hypothesised that targeted azithromycin delivered to children at hospital discharge would
 reduce severe morbidity and mortality while minimising population-level exposure to this
 broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic. To test this hypothesis, we did a randomised clinical
 trial testing the effect of azithromycin administered at hospital discharge on risk of death and
 rehospitalisation in Kenyan children younger than 5 years.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study design and participants
 
<section> Author The Toto Bora trial was a multi-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised controlled
 trial done at four hospitals in Kenya. The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan
 are described elsewhere (appendix pp 9–44). 
<section> 16 Briefly, children were recruited from the
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> inpatient wards of Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital, Homa Bay Teaching and Referral
 Hospital, St Paul Mission Hospital, and Kendu Adventist Mission Hospital (Kenya) between
 June 28, 2016, and Nov 4, 2019. All children discharged during study working hours
 (Monday to Friday 0800 h to 1600 h) were screened for eligibility. Children aged 1–59
 months were eligible at hospital discharge if they weighed at least 2 kg and had been
 admitted to hospital for any medical reason other than trauma, poisoning, or congenital
 anomaly. Children were excluded if they had been prescribed a macrolide antibiotic (ie,
 azithromycin, erythromycin, or clarithromycin) at discharge, were taking a protease inhibitor
 (eg, lopinavir) for HIV infection, or if they had a documented allergy to macrolide
 
<section> Author antibiotics. Additionally, children were excluded if their caregiver did not plan for them
 to remain in the study area for 6 months, if a twin sibling of the same sex was enrolled
 contemporaneously, or if the accompanying caregiver was not the legal guardian.

<section> The trial was approved by the institutional review boards at the Kenya Medical Research
 Institute (KEMRI; SERU 3086, Sept 8, 2015, to present), the Kenya Pharmacy and Poisons
 Board (ECCT/15/10/04, Dec 3, 2015, to present), and the University of Washington (IRB

<section> Manuscript 
<section> Randomisation and masking
 Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of ten, stratified by site, to receive either
 azithromycin or identically appearing and tasting placebo at discharge. By use of a random
 number generator in Microsoft Excel, each participant was assigned a unique identifier, and
 the randomisation code linking each identifier to the allocated treatment was maintained by
 staff not otherwise involved in the study. Identically appearing bottles were labelled with
 the unique identifier, masking study staff and participants to randomisation group. Study
 participants, investigators, the study staff, hospital clinicians, and individuals involved in
 data management or analysis were masked to the allocation group during all data collection
 
<section> Author and management phases of the study.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> Consenting caregivers were interviewed to assess demographic information and medical
 history, and clinical data of the child were abstracted from hospital records, including
 presenting diagnosis, medical management, length of stay, procedures done, relevant
 medical history, physical examination, and laboratory data. Case report forms can be found
 in the appendix (pp 53–128). These interviews ranged from 30 min to 60 min in length.
 A physical examination was done by a study clinician, including measurement of height or
 length, weight, and mid-upper arm circumference.
 
<section> After discharge, enrolled children received either a 5-day course of oral suspension
 
<section> Author formulation azithromycin (10 mg/kg on day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg per day on days 2–5)
 or identically appearing and tasting placebo. The first dose was directly observed. Doses on
 days 2–5 were administered by caregivers at home. Caregivers were asked to record each
 
<section> Manuscript administered dose and to return bottles at the 3-month follow-up visit.
 
<section> During scheduled follow-up visits at 3 months and 6 months post-discharge, history of
 recent illness or morbidity, post-discharge medication use, and current condition of the
 child were collected by use of a standardised questionnaire. If the child could not return
 to the facility, a member of the study staff visited the child’s home. If the child was not
 found at their home after two attempts, a telephone interview was done, lasting 20–45
 min. If hospitalisations were reported during the interview, their date, length of stay, and
 medications administered were ascertained from both caregivers and medical records (when
 accessible). Caregivers were encouraged to bring the child to the study health facility when
 
<section> Author
 
<section> seeking care for illness (unscheduled visits) and the study team triaged the child’s care.
 
<section> When a death occurred, a verbal autopsy was done with use of a validated questionnaire.
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> Final causes of death were determined by consensus among masked clinical investigators
 (BOS, KDT, and JLW) on the basis of available death certificates, medical records, and
 verbal autopsies. 
<section> We collected whole stool or flocked rectal swabs (Pediatric FLOQswab, Copan Diagnostics,
 
<section> Author Murrieta, CA, USA) before study medication administration at enrolment and at the 3­
 month and 6-month follow-up visits. A portion of stool or swab was placed in Cary-Blair
 media (Copan Diagnostics) within 1 h of collection. Samples were maintained between
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> 2°C and 8°C and shipped to the KEMRI Center for Microbiology laboratory in Nairobi for
 processing within 24 h of collection. Escherichia coli colonies were grown and identified by
 use of selective and differential agar plating, Gram staining, and oxidase testing and further
 confirmed using API-20E testing kits (bioMerieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France). Three colonies
 per sample were pooled into 15% glycerol and frozen at −80°C for potential antibiotic
 susceptibility testing.
 
<section> E coli isolates from a randomly selected subset of children enrolled in the trial underwent
 antibiotic resistance testing with the disc diffusion method. Frozen stocks were thawed,
 
<section> Author quadrant-streaked onto MacConkey agar, and incubated at 37°C in ambient air. If more than
 one morphologically distinct colony was present upon restoration, each was individually
 subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing. Isolates from up to three morphologies were
 
<section> Manuscript placed separately in 5 mL of normal saline standardised to a 0·5 MacFarland turbidity
 standard and plated on Mueller Hinton agar with antibiotic discs placed on the agar surface.
 Plates were inoculated for 18–24 h at 37°C before the measurement of zones of inhibition.
 Zone sizes had not been established for resistance to azithromycin in E coli at the time of
 writing; therefore we considered 13 mm or more to be susceptible and 12 mm or less to
 be resistant on the basis of epidemiological breakpoints for Salmonella enterica serotype
 Typhi. 
<section> 17 If a child had more than one morphologically distinct E coli isolate at a given
 timepoint, the E coli was considered resistant to azithromycin if one or more of the colonies
 was resistant.

<section> Outcomes
 
<section> The primary outcome was death or rehospitalisation in the 6 months after hospital
 
<section> Manuscript discharge. Secondary outcomes included cause-specific death and proportion of children
 with azithromycin-resistant E coli Mild, moderate, and severe adverse events were
 identified by the study clinicians during clinical examinations at scheduled and unscheduled
 follow-up or reported by caregivers during interviews at scheduled visits. Event severity
 was defined according to the 2014 Division of AIDS table for grading the severity of adult
 and paediatric adverse events. Adverse events were captured throughout the entire follow-up
 period, and plausible relatedness was determined by the clinical team after full review of
 the case. Non-serious adverse events were considered to be possibly related to the study
 drug if a recognised side-effect of azithromycin (diarrhoea, vomiting, rash, facial or airway
 
<section> Author swelling, difficulty breathing, jaundice, and abdominal swelling) occurred within 72 h of a
 scheduled drug administration (ie, within 7 days of study enrolment).
 
<section> Manuscript 
<section> Statistical analysis
 
<section> A sample size of 1400 children was calculated for the primary endpoint, assuming an α level
 of 0·05, power of 0·80, 1:1 randomisation, 20% loss to follow-up, a cumulative incidence of
 22·5% for the combined outcome among children treated with placebo, 
<section> 14,15,18 and a hazard
 ratio of 0·70. At the time of study planning (2013–14), the best evidence of the effect of 
<section> empirical azithromycin on childhood mortality was an observed 49% reduction in mortality
 
<section> Author after azithromycin mass drug administration in Ethiopia; 
<section> 19 thus a 30% reduction was chosen
 as a more conservative effect size.
 
<section> Manuscript We used Cox proportional hazards regression to compare the rates of death or first
 rehospitalisation after discharge on the basis of randomisation allocation, excluding any
 children deemed ineligible after randomisation (modified intention-to-treat [mITT]). All
 analyses were adjusted for site as an indicator variable. In secondary analyses, we
 adjusted for breastfeeding status and a discharge diagnosis of “other”, modelled as
 indicator variables, to account for a possible imbalance in these two variables between
 the randomisation groups. In per-protocol analyses, we compared treatment effects in groups
 defined by self-reported adherence to the 5-day course of azithromycin (five doses vs fewer
 than five doses). The primary adherence measure was self-reporting at follow-up visits and
 
<section> Author the secondary adherence measure was the number of bottle tick marks on returned bottles
 collected at follow-up visits. Additionally, we did Cox regression for time to mortality
 and time to rehospitalisation as separate endpoints. In prespecified subgroup analyses, we
 
<section> Manuscript compared treatment effects in children whose caregivers reported no additional antibiotic
 use during follow-up and among subsets of children defined by age, site, HIV status,
 malnutrition status, and discharge diagnosis. An α of 0·045 was used as the statistical
 significance boundary for the final primary analysis due to α spending at a predefined
 interim analysis, as specified in the statistical analysis plan (appendix pp 31–44).
 
<section> We modelled azithromycin resistance in E coli at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months of
 follow-up by randomisation group using generalised estimating equations with a Poisson
 link and exchangeable correlation structure, including site in the model. Models included an
 interaction term between randomisation group and follow-up timepoint (month 3 or month
 
<section> Author
 
<section> 6) to test whether an effect on resistance waned with time. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were
 reported for two-way comparisons between randomisation groups and within randomisation
 groups, by follow-up visit. E coli isolated from stool collected at follow-up visits outside of
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> a 60–120-day window for 3-month visits and outside of a 150–210-day window for 6-month
 visits were excluded from the primary analysis but included in sensitivity analyses. Models
 were done in the mITT population among those with antimicrobial resistance testing done
 and in whom E coli was isolated. All analyses were done in STATA, version 16.0, and R.
 
<section> A data safety and monitoring committee reviewed monthly adverse event summaries and
 details of severe adverse events. A single interim analysis was done in Dec 20, 2018, when
 50% of expected person-time (350 child-years) was accrued. O’Brien-Fleming boundaries
 with a two-sided Z score critical value of 2·797 or −2·797 (p value <0·005) were used
 
<section> Author to compare the interim analysis p value from a Kaplan-Meier log-rank test. This trial is
 registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02414399.

<section> Results
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Between June 28, 2016, and Nov 4, 2019, 3283 children discharged from study hospitals
 were screened for eligibility and 1400 of those were enrolled in the trial, with 703 (50·2%)
 
<section> Manuscript randomly assigned to azithromycin and 697 (49·8%) to placebo (figure 1). One child in each
 group was deemed ineligible after randomisation: one child in the azithromycin group had
 been admitted for poisoning and one in the placebo group had a twin sibling of the same sex
 enrolled in the trial on the same day.
 
<section> Among the 1398 children included in the mITT analysis, 465 (33·3%) were younger than
 12 months, 570 (40·8%) were girls, and 874 (62·5%) were from households living on
 less than US$1·90 per day (table 1). At enrolment, 315 (22·6%) children were stunted,
 132 (9·4%) had acute malnutrition, 147 (10·5%) were exposed to HIV, and 18 (1·3%)
 were confirmed to be infected with HIV. Common diagnoses at discharge included lower
 
<section> Author
 
<section> respiratory tract infection, malaria, and gastroenteritis or diarrhoea (table 1). Participant
 characteristics were balanced across the randomisation groups, except for slightly fewer
 
<section> Manuscript children in the azithromycin group with a diagnosis of “other” (driven largely by more
 urinary tract infection diagnoses in the placebo group than in the azithromycin group)
 and slightly more children in the azithromycin group being partly (rather than exclusively)
 breastfed during the first 6 months of life.
 
<section> Most children (1253 [89·6%]) received an antibiotic during hospitalisation, most
 commonly penicillin (839 [60·0%] of 1398 in the mITT), gentamicin (757 [54·2%]), and
 ceftriaxone (538 [38·5%]). Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin) were
 infrequently given in hospital (52 [3·7%]), with azithromycin prescribed to only 24 (1·7%)
 children. Many children (867 [62·0%]) were also prescribed an antibiotic at discharge, most
 
<section> Author commonly amoxicillin (600 [42·9%]), penicillin (87 [6·2%]), and cefuroxime (82 [5·9%]).
 Antimalarials were also frequently administered in hospital, with 509 (36·4%) children
 receiving an antimalarial during hospitalisation, most commonly artemether lumefantrine
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> (161 [11·5%]), paludrine (49 [3·5%]), artesunate (447 [32·0%]), and quinine (two [0·1%]).
 Additionally, nearly a third (379 [27·1%]) of children were prescribed an antimalarial at
 discharge (281 [20·1%] artemether lumefantrine, 106 [7·6%] paludrine, and three [0·2%]
 artesunate).
 
<section> 34 (2·4%) children died during the 6-month follow-up and 115 (8·2%) children were
 rehospitalised at least once (table 2). Ten children (0·7%) were hospitalised twice. The
 incidence of the combined outcome of death or first rehospitalisation was 20·4 per
 child-years in children randomly assigned to azithromycin and 22·5 per 100 child-years
 
<section> Author in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·91, 95·5% CI 0·64-1·29, p=0·58; table
 2, figure 2). The incidence of rehospitalisation alone was similar in the azithromycin and
 placebo groups (table 2). Approximately a quarter of the 115 first rehospitalisations occurred
 
<section> Manuscript in the first 30 days after initial discharge (13 [22·4%] of 58 in the azithromycin group and 15
 [26·3%] of 57 in the placebo group). The incidence of death was 4·7 per 100 child-years in
 the azithromycin group and 6·0 per 100 child-years in the placebo group (adjusted HR 0·79,
 95·5% CI 0·39-1·58). Approximately a third of deaths in each group occurred in the first
 days of follow-up (four [26·7%] of 15 in the azithromycin group and seven [36·8%] of 
<section> in the placebo group), two of which in each group occurred within the first 7 days. Another
 
<section> Author third of deaths occurred in the 31–90-day post-discharge period (six [40·0%] of 15 in the
 azithromycin group and six [31·6%] of 19 in the placebo group) and the remaining third
 occurred 91–180 days after discharge (five [33·3%] of 15 in the azithromycin group and
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> six [31·6%] of 19 in the placebo group). Causes of death are reported in table 3. Subgroup
 analyses did not identify subgroups more or less likely to benefit from azithromycin’s effect
 on risk of rehospitalisation or death in the 6-month post-discharge period (appendix p 6).
 
<section> All children were directly observed receiving the first dose of study drug, and more than
 90% received all five doses according to caregiver report by questionnaire (appendix p
 3). Roughly 70% of caregivers returned bottles for the secondary adherence assessment
 (702 [73·3%] in the azithromycin group and 696 [71·7%] in the placebo group), and 265
 (51·5%) in the azithromycin group and 266 (53·3%) in the placebo group indicated by tick

<section> Manuscript of azithromycin on the risk of death or rehospitalisation (alone or in combination) did not
 meaningfully differ from the mITT analysis results (appendix pp 4–6).
 
<section> E coli were isolated from faecal samples from 1219 (87·2%) of 1398 children at hospital
 discharge, from 1212 (96·1%) of 1261 with faecal samples at 3 months, and 1145 (94·6%) of
 1210 with faecal samples at 6 months. 406 children enrolled with at least one baseline E coli
 isolate were randomly selected for antimicrobial resistance testing; of those, 350 had month
 3 isolates and 330 had month 6 isolates also available from within the 1-month window
 for antimicrobial resistance testing. 153 (37·7%) baseline E coli isolates were resistant to
 azithromycin (38·4% in the azithromycin group and 36·9% in the placebo group). At the
 
<section> Author
 
<section> 3-month follow-up visit, these percentages decreased by almost half in both groups (PR
 0·54, 95% CI 0·32–0·91, p=0·02 for month 3 vs month 0 visit in the azithromycin group,
 and 0·52, 0·35–0·75, p=0–001 for month 3 vs month 0 visit in the placebo group; figure
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> 3). We observed a modestly higher prevalence of azithromycin resistance 3 months after
 randomisation in the azithromycin group (26·9%) than in the placebo group (19·1%; PR
 1·41, 95% CI 0·95–2·09, p=0·088) with no difference at 6 months after randomisation
 between the intervention and placebo groups (1·17, 0·78–1·76, p=0·44, p 
<section> time-interaction
 =0·45). When including E coli isolates that occurred outside of visit windows, results did not
 meaningfully differ (appendix p 8).
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> Author In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 1400 children in Kenya, a
 5-day course of azithromycin administered to children being discharged from hospital did
 not decrease the risk of the combined outcome of mortality or rehospitalisation in the
 
<section> Manuscript subsequent 6-month period. We did not observe a significant benefit in this trial despite the
 overall high risk of mortality and rehospitalisation. Our findings differ from those found in
 other mass drug administration trials of azithromycin for mortality prevention. 
<section> 20 The high
 rates of adverse outcomes observed underscore the importance of the post-discharge period
 to child health and the need to develop guidelines and interventions for this crucial period. 
<section> WHO guidelines recommend mass drug administration with azithromycin to promote
 
<section> Author survival in children aged 1–11 months in settings where the under-5 mortality is more
 than eight deaths per 100 child-years on the basis of several trials of azithromycin delivered
 through mass drug administration. 
<section> 3,20 We did not detect an age effect in reducing the
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> combined outcome of death or rehospitalisation, despite observing a mortality rate of 8·1
 deaths per 100 child-years in children younger than 1 year. This study was designed to
 detect a primary outcome of death or rehospitalisation and was not designed or powered to
 evaluate mortality alone or to evaluate age-specific effects. As a result, we cannot exclude
 the possibility that azithromycin delivered at hospital discharge confers a mortality benefit
 at least as large as that observed in studies of mass drug administration to improve child
 survival.
 
<section> Almost all children received antibiotics during their inpatient stay and most were prescribed
 
<section> Author antibiotics at discharge, although we do not know how many of those prescriptions were
 filled. It is possible that these antibiotics treated nosocomial or incompletely treated
 infections, reducing the additional benefit of azithromycin in the early discharge period.
 
<section> Manuscript Alternative treatment schedules, such as intermittent antimicrobial administration, might be
 a more effective strategy for post-discharge treatment with azithromycin, as has been shown
 in trials of post-discharge malaria chemoprophylaxis. 
<section> 21,22 High antibiotic usage during and
 immediately after hospital discharge might also have selected for antimicrobial resistance,
 which could have further reduced the benefit conferred by azithromycin. Importantly,
 mortality benefits observed in mass drug administration trials of azithromycin might be due
 to the indirect effects related to population-wide delivery, such as reducing pathogen load
 in communities and environments, which could explain the lack of effect in this targeted,
 individually randomised trial. Such indirect effects have been observed in trials of mass drug
 administration of azithromycin for trachoma control. 23,24
 
<section> Author
 
<section> Over a third of enrolled children had azithromycin resistance detected in commensal E
 coli at the time of randomisation, despite few receiving a macrolide antibiotic during their
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> hospital stay. Although azithromycin resistance was common among children at hospital
 discharge, resistance declined substantially in the 3 months and 6 months after discharge
 in both study groups. This decline might be due to a fitness disadvantage of azithromycin­
 resistant E coli isolates such that once antibiotic pressure is removed, wild-type isolates
 become more predominant. 
<section> 25 This occurrence could explain why individual-level antibiotic
 use tends to be a less important driver of antibiotic resistance than community use of
 antibiotics or a physical environment conducive to resistance-gene sharing, such as crowded
 settings with poor sanitation. 
<section> 26–28 We observed a slightly higher azithromycin resistance
 prevalence in E coli isolates from children randomly assigned to the azithromycin group at
 
<section> Author 3 months but this difference of borderline significance was no longer present at 6 months,
 consistent with transient increases observed in some mass drug administration trials. 4–7,29
 
<section> Manuscript Our study had high retention (>99%), a well characterised study population, complete
 adherence to the first dose of study medication, and high adherence to the full 5-day
 course reported by caregivers. However, our study also had important limitations. With the
 number of events observed (n=132), we were powered to detect an HR of 0·61 for the
 combined endpoint of death or rehospitalisation and, with 34 deaths, an HR of 0·35 for 
<section> the outcome of death alone. Powering our trial for the observed HR of 0·91 (or a 9%
 
<section> Author reduction in rehospitalisation or death) would have required 36 000 children to be enrolled.
 22 000 children would have been required to detect the observed HR for death alone of
 0·79. These sample sizes exceed what is feasible within individually randomised clinical
 
<section> Manuscript
 
<section> trials, but community-randomised trials are powered to detect these more modest effect
 sizes. 2 We chose to evaluate a combined outcome of death and rehospitalisation because
 hospitalisation is strongly associated with mortality and represents a severe economic event
 to many families, even in settings where paediatric care is free. 
<section> 14 However, hospitalisation
 might be a heterogeneous outcome, driven partly by financial resources and location. 
<section> 30 A
 trial of azithromycin in conjunction with seasonal malaria prophylaxis in Mali and Burkina
 Faso also used a combined outcome of all-cause hospitalisation or death and observed no
 evidence of benefit, perhaps also due to hospitalisation being a heterogeneous outcome.
 Additionally, the assessment of adherence to the study medication in this trial was limited to
 
<section> Author self-report, which might have overestimated the true adherence to the study medication.
 
<section> As countries work towards achieving the sustainable development goal of reducing
 
<section> Manuscript childhood mortality to fewer than 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths, 
<section> 32 hospital discharge
 represents a practical timepoint for delivering life-saving interventions to children at high
 risk. Although several trials of azithromycin delivered through mass drug administration
 have shown mortality benefit, our trial did not show efficacy in reducing mortality or
 rehospitalisation with a 5-day course of azithromycin administered to children younger than
 5 years at discharge from hospital. Novel interventions to reduce mortality and morbidity
 during the post-discharge period are urgently needed to address the substantial burden of
 illness during this crucial period.

<section> Evidence before this study
 
<section> Manuscript We reviewed relevant clinical trials on the effect of azithromycin on morbidity and
 mortality identified by searching PubMed for articles in English from inception to
 Dec 25, 2020, using the following MeSH search terms: “(“mortality” OR “morbidity”)
 AND “azithromycin” AND “Africa, Sub Saharan””, with filters accepting only “(clinical
 trials OR systematic reviews)” and “children”. These search criteria yielded 35 results,
 including a systematic review and meta-analysis of cluster-randomised clinical trials of
 the effect of mass azithromycin use for prevention of childhood mortality in sub-Saharan
 Africa. This meta-analysis reported pooled child mortality rates in azithromycin-treated
 and placebo-treated communities. We found only a single individually randomised trial
 of azithromycin that evaluated a combined outcome of hospitalisation or death (a trial
 
<section> Author
 
<section> of azithromycin in conjunction with seasonal malaria chemoprevention), which found no
 difference between randomisation groups.
 
<section> Manuscript 
<section> Added value of this study
 
<section> We did an individually randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a 5-day
 course of azithromycin given to 1400 Kenyan children who were discharged from
 hospital. Children discharged from hospital are an accessible population at high risk
 of morbidity and mortality, in whom the targeted use of azithromycin could reduce
 mortality while minimising risk of community-wide antibiotic resistance. Despite the
 high incidence of rehospitalisation and death in children treated with placebo, we found
 no evidence of an effect of azithromycin on the combined outcome of rehospitalisation or
 death and a modestly higher prevalence of azithromycin resistance at 3 months but not at
 
<section> Author 6 months after randomisation.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 
<section> Manuscript As countries work towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of reducing
 childhood mortality to fewer than 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths, hospital discharge
 represents a practical timepoint for delivering life-saving interventions to children at high
 risk. We did not find evidence of benefit in reducing mortality or rehospitalisation from
 a 5-day course of azithromycin administered at discharge from hospital. In 2020, WHO
 released a series of evidence reviews and guidelines recommending against universal
 mass drug administration of azithromycin for preventing child mortality but included
 a consideration for its use among children aged 1–11 months living in sub-Saharan
 African settings with high child mortality rates. The lack of an observed effect in our
 
<section> Author trial highlights the need for further research into mechanisms of childhood mortality
 prevention from empirical azithromycin administration.

 Data are n (%) or n. Adverse event grade is defined according to 2014 Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric
 Adverse Events.
 Four serious adverse events were flagged as potentially related to the study drug during data collection, but all four were found to be in
 placebo-treated children after unblinding the study. An additional ten moderate or mild adverse events were considered potentially related before
 study unblinding: eight among placebo-treated children and two were in azithromycin-treated children.
