<section> Key questions
 
<section> What is already known?
 
<section> ► Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious health
 and human rights violation which impacts approxi-
 mately one in three women worldwide.
 
<section> ► Women in many settings desire to keep their rela-
 tionships intact while eliminating violence, but there
 is little evidence to date on how to do this safely and
 effectively.
 
<section> What are the new findings?
 
<section> ► Couples who participated in the Indashyikirwa cou-
 ples’ training programme versus village savings and
 loan association (VSLA) alone had greatly reduced
 IPV at 24 months, with women 56% less likely to
 experience physical and/or sexual IPV and men 46%
 less likely to perpetrate physical and/or sexual IPV.
 
<section> ► Participants in the Indashyikirwa couples’ training
 programme versus VSLA alone also experienced a
 range of other benefits including reduced conflict,
 better communication and trust, reduced exposure
 of children in the home to violence and improve-
 ments in health and household economic status.
 
<section> What do the new findings imply?
 
<section> ► The Indashyikirwa couples’ training programme
 was safe and highly effective at reducing IPV among
 male–female couples in rural Rwanda and brought
 a range of other related benefits to participating
 couples.
 
<section> ► Scale-­up and adaptation of this evidence-­based cur-
 riculum to similar settings should be considered.
 
<section> negative health consequences including
 depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, 2 post-­
 traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 3 drug and
 alcohol abuse, 1 injuries and even death. In
 addition, IPV has been linked to poor sexual
 and reproductive outcomes, negative behav-
 ioural and health outcomes for children, and
 intergenerational patterns of abuse.
 A growing number of interventions to
 prevent or reduce IPV have been rigorously
 evaluated in sub-­ Saharan Africa, including 
<section> programmes designed to empower women, engage men
 and boys, and transform community norms that condone
 violence and endorse male dominance. 5 Several of these
 have demonstrated reductions in violence in the range
 of 30%–50% over 12–24 months of follow-­ up. 6 7 Few
 programmes, however, have attempted to work directly
 with male–female couples to prevent and mitigate
 IPV, despite the fact that many such couples desire to
 stay together and/or women feel they have no viable
 economic or sociocultural alternative to leave.
 Couple’s programming around IPV raises valid
 concerns regarding safety, enforced reconciliation and
 implying mutual responsibility for violence among part-
 ners. 8 Yet if managed responsibly, work with couples can
 avoid these pitfalls and potentially reduce the frequency
 and severity of abuse in relationships. In settings where
 half or more women experience some form of violence,
 and both women and men may view physical discipline
 and non-­ consensual sex as a husband’s prerogative,
 women need viable options for addressing violence in
 their relationships beyond leaving, 9 especially in settings
 where male partners offer critical economic support and
 social norms provide little to no support for ending a part-
 nership. Challenging harmful gender norms, addressing
 relationship dynamics and teaching both partners skills
 in self-­regulation, communication and managing conflict
 can help women feel safer within relationships that they
 otherwise value. 8
 There is thus emerging interest in working with couples
 on IPV prevention, especially in the Global South. 11 Such
 approaches typically use group or community-­ based
 formats with trained facilitators rather than therapists
 or counsellors, and often respond to high generalised
 rates of IPV, as well as economic and social conditions
 that hinder women from leaving unsafe relationships.
 This paper seeks to enhance the global evidence base
 on couples’ programming by sharing findings from an
 evaluation of the couples’ component of Indashyikirwa,
 an IPV prevention programme in Rwanda. A separate
 manuscript presents findings from the results from
 repeat cross-­sectional surveys of the communities before
 and after the three other components of Indashyikirwa, as
 well as insights from the detailed process evaluation that
 accompanied the rollout.
 The full Indashyikirwa ‘Agents of Change’ programme
 included four interlocking components: a 21-­ session
 couples’ curriculum; community outreach by trained
 community activists; the creation of an enabling envi-
 ronment through training and active involvement of
 key opinion leaders; and provision of support to victims
 through the creation of women’s ‘safe spaces’. 13 14 The
 Couples Curriculum drew on Journeys of Transforma-
 tion (JoT)—a 17-­session participatory curriculum imple-
 mented by CARE Rwanda, the Rwandan Men’s Resource
 Centre (RWAMREC) and Promundo—to foster men’s
 support of their partners’ participation in CARE’s village
 savings and loan associations (VSLA). A small mixed-­
 method evaluation found that the JoT curriculum reduced
 household-­level poverty and had a positive impact on
 partners’ collaboration around household and care work,
 family relations and decision-­making, but had an unclear
 impact on IPV. 15 As part of explicitly addressing IPV
 prevention, Indashyikirwa also drew heavily from SASA!,
 a community mobilisation programme implemented by
 CEDOVIP (Centre for Domestic Violence Prevention)
 and Raising Voices in Kampala, Uganda. A randomised
 controlled trial of SASA! found significant shifts in accep-
 tance of IPV, and a 52% reduction in past-­year reports
 of physical IPV among women experiencing violence
 at baseline. 7 16–18 In this study, graduates of the couples’
 training curriculum who wished to carry the work forward
 to others were offered the opportunity to put themselves
 forward for additional training as community activists, to
 help facilitate a broader process of community change.
 While only about 25% of the couples’ training gradu-
 ates received this additional training due to budgetary
 constraints, many more individuals engaged in commu-
 nity education and advocacy activities either in support
 of their partners who had been so trained or at their own
 initiative. Findings from this aspect of Indashyikirwa are
 described in detail elsewhere.
 To assess the impact of the Indashyikirwa couples’
 programme, we conducted a community randomised
 controlled trial (cRCT). Outcomes for participants in the
 couples’ training were assessed at the individual level. We
 hypothesised that participation in the couples training,
 in the context of the broader Indashyikirwa programme,
 would lead to reduced experience of IPV among women
 and reduced perpetration of IPV among men, accompa-
 nied by reductions in the number of children witnessing
 IPV and increased help seeking among women experi-
 encing IPV. We additionally hypothesised that couples
 participating in the training would experience improved
 relationship quality, reduced depression, reduced alcohol
 use (for men only), reduced belief in the acceptability of
 IPV and increased engagement with their communities
 around IPV. At the request of implementing partners,
 we also specified exploratory outcomes related to the
 possible beneficial impact of the programme on house-
 hold economic status, parenting practices and partici-
 pants’ health.
 
<section> Methods
 Study location, design and community randomisation
 The Indashyikirwa trial was implemented in seven districts
 of Rwanda, spread across the Eastern, Northern and
 Western provinces. Implementation districts were chosen
 by the programme implementing partners based on
 examination of the RDHS 2010 data to identify areas with
 high rates of IPV, in combination with a strong presence
 of CARE’s VSLA programmes. 19 Because the full four-­
 component Indashyikirwa programme was designed to
 operate at sector level, sectors were chosen as the unit
 of randomisation for the impact evaluation. To identify
 potential sectors for inclusion in the cRCT, we mapped

<section> GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates of the
 meeting locations for active VSLA groups to identify
 those sectors with a sufficient concentration of VSLAs to
 support implementation of two distinct Couples’ groups
 in different cells within the sector (figure 1). Sectors
 identified as having adequate recruitment potential were
 then reviewed with programme partners to ensure that
 each identified sector could be equally viable as either
 an intervention or control area. As part of this eligibility
 assessment, two cells within that sectors were preselected
 as sites for implementation of either couples’ curriculum
 or control group recruitment. The top 28 sectors thus
 identified were then randomised by an independent stat-
 istician, with stratification across the seven districts. The
 final number of sectors per district ranged from 2 to
 Due to the need to obtain approval from district and
 sector-­ level gatekeepers before enrolling participants,
 no blinding of participants, enumerators or other study
 staff was attempted. Gatekeeper approval was obtained
 by RWAMREC staff for intervention sites, and for control
 sites, it was handled in partnership by RWAMREC and
 senior field staff employed by Laterite Ltd., the local
 research firm contracted for data collection.
 
<section> Identification and selection of participants
 RWAMREC staff handled recruitment of potential inter-
 vention participants in the intervention sectors, while
 recruitment for control participants was conducted by
 field staff employed by Laterite. In both cases, the eligi-
 bility criteria for couples to enrol were as follows: at least
 one member of the couple had to be an active VSLA
 member; they must live together or be married to each
 other for at least 6 months prior to enrolment; both part-
 ners should be between 18 and 49 years old; and they
 should have no current plans to move out of the cluster
 in the next 2.5 years.
 To recruit intervention participants, RWAMREC
 invited all VSLA members (the majority of whom are
 women) in each of the two preselected cells per sector
 to a community meeting where they announced the
 
<section> BMJ Global Health
 
<section> forthcoming programme and invited those in potentially
 eligible couples to put themselves forward for participa-
 tion. Participants were then randomly selected by public
 lottery from among those eligible couples who volun-
 teered. Participation in the impact evaluation was not
 mandatory for individuals to participate in the couples
 training, but all participants who signed up for the train-
 ings were invited to participate in the impact evaluations.
 In the control communities, field staff from Laterite
 invited all VSLA members in each of the two identified
 cells to a similar community meeting to describe the
 research and invited eligible couples to volunteer to
 participate in a series of three interviews over a period of
 24 months. A random lottery was again conducted from
 among the volunteers to select final participants.
 The full four-­ component Indashyikirwa programme
 was implemented in all intervention sectors by CARE
 Rwanda, RWAMREC and the Rwanda Women’s Network
 (RWN). The Couple’s Curriculum incorporated the
 
<section> SASA! programme’s emphasis on positive and negative
 types and uses of power, critical personal reflection and
 positive aspirations for healthy relationships. 7 18 20 The
 curriculum also worked explicitly to address triggers of
 IPV (including disagreements about money, jealousy
 and alcohol abuse) and emphasised skills building to
 create positive alternatives to violence. 21 The full training
 manual is available online (https://www.​whatworks.​co.​
 za/​ r esources/​ i tem/​ 5 60-​ c ouples-​ c urriculum-​ t raining-​
 module) and training manuals for the other three
 components are available on the website (https://www.​
 whatworks.​co.​za/). The control sectors continued routine
 implementation of CARE-­run VSLA programmes.
 
<section> Data collection procedures
 Data were collected at baseline, 12 months post-­baseline
 and 24 months post-­ baseline. For the baseline round
 of data collection, all potential participants identified
 during recruitment were invited to attend appointments
 at a convenient central location, with separate data
 collection locations for women and men. For follow-­up 
<section> interviews, field staff phoned ahead to verify participants’
 current locations and set up appointments for interviews.
 By default, all interviews were conducted in Kinyarwanda
 via ACASI (audio-­enhanced computer self-­interviewing).
 Gender-­ matched interviewers stayed close at hand to
 assist participants who required clarifications or technical
 assistance. Participants who were not sufficiently literate
 to make use of the technology or who for any reason
 preferred an in-­person interview were interviewed face-­
 to-­face by a gender-­matched enumerator. This option was
 chosen by 23.8% (n=395) of women and 14.6% (n=240)
 of men at baseline; 25.8% (n=423) of women and 9.5%
 (n=151) of men at 12 months follow-­ up; and 18.9%
 (n=306) of women and 5.9% (n=90) of men at endline.
 
<section> Outcomes
 
<section> Table 1 describes the primary, secondary and explora-
 tory outcome measures included for women and men.
 The primary outcome was experience (for women) or
 perpetration (for men) of physical and/or sexual IPV
 in the previous 12 months assessed using the adapted
 WHO violence against women tools. 22 It included five
 items on physical IPV and three items on sexual IPV
 with answer choices of never, once, a few times or
 many times. Per the What Works consortium agree-
 ment on IPV primary outcome measure, it was coded
 as ‘yes’ if any answer was >once and/or multiple items
 were endorsed. To further examine how the interven-
 tion impacted on IPV, we also defined a small number
 of secondary outcomes related to IPV. These included
 looking at subgroup analysis among those who did and
 did not report experience of the primary IPV outcome
 at baseline (to look at primary prevention vs cessation of
 IPV), and separate analysis of the four individual types
 of IPV: physical IPV, forced or coerced sex (sexual IPV),
 economic abuse and (women’s report only) emotional
 aggression/abuse.
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> The number of couples to be trained using the Indashy-
 ikirwa curriculum was set by the implementing partners
 based on operational and budgeting constraints. We
 thus had a fixed number of sectors (n=28; 14 interven-
 tion and 14 control) as well as a fixed cluster size within
 each sector (60 couples). From these fixed numbers,
 we calculated the minimum detectable difference given
 α=0.05 and β=0.80, and allowing for up to 20% loss to
 follow-­up using equation 26 in Hemming et al. 23 We used
 intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) estimated
 conservatively at 0.20 as well as a more typical ICC=0.10
 and estimated the detectable reduction in past
 months IPV for baseline prevalence ranging from 10%
 to 30%. These estimates allow for a relative detectable
 difference of 44%–26% (detectable absolute difference
 of 9.3%–4.4%) which was considered adequate power, as
 best evidence interventions for IPV prevention tend to
 show relative reductions of around 30%–50%. 6
 
<section> Data analysis
 
<section> All participants were used in the data analysis, excluding
 those who were only present at baseline. We first
 described baseline characteristics of men and women
 across study arms. Because of the cluster-­level randomi-
 sation, lack of masking and slight differences in recruit-
 ment procedures across study arms, we tested for differ-
 ences between intervention and control participants and
 adjusted subsequent analysis for variables found to be
 significantly different between arms. We then checked if
 there was any differential loss to follow-­up by study arm
 assignment or baseline demographic characteristics and
 included these as baseline covariates in outcome models.
 All tests took into account the complex sampling nature
 of the data, treating sectors as cluster and districts as
 sampling strata in computation of standard errors.
 To evaluate the impact of the intervention at the
 24-­month follow-­up, we performed an intention-­to-­treat
 (ITT) analysis using generalised linear mixed effects
 modelling (multilevel model for change) with a Gaussian
 link function to compare mean scores at endline for all
 continuous outcomes and a Poisson link function for
 count data. 24 For the binary outcomes, we used gener-
 alised linear mixed effects models with a logit link func-
 tion to compare the effect of the intervention between
 the two study arms. The fixed effects terms in all models
 included the study arm, data collection wave and an
 interaction term for study arm and data collection wave.
 The district in which data were collected was also treated
 as a fixed effect to account for possible geographic vari-
 ation in impact. Sector (the unit of randomisation) was
 added in as a random effects term. Based on the findings
 regarding demographics and loss to follow-­up, models
 for outcomes among women were adjusted for type of
 VSLA membership reported at baseline (self, partner or
 both); baseline asset scores; and experience of physical
 or sexual IPV from a previous partner. For men, covari-
 ates for outcomes models were marriage versus cohabita-
 tion at baseline, VSLA membership type, baseline asset
 scores and being beaten often or very often as a child. All
 models were adjusted for age and the baseline value of
 the outcome in question.
 The effect of the intervention was assessed at 12 and 24
 months (endline) using linear combinations of the fixed
 effect terms in the model (study arm and data collection
 wave). The 12-­month findings are considered as interim
 results and the 24-­month findings are considered the
 final effects. We compared women from the control arm
 with women from the intervention arm, and men from
 the control arm with men from the intervention arm.
 Stata/SE V.16.0 was used for final data analysis.

 experienced any distress, with services offered either in
 person, over the phone or via referral at a later time. She
 also provided regular debriefing sessions for fieldwork
 staff. All deaths and other serious adverse events discov-
 ered to have occurred among study participants during
 follow-­up data collection were investigated for possible
 relationship to study participation.
 
<section> Patient and public involvement
 Our community partner organisations, CARE Rwanda,
 RWAMREC and RWN participated in framing the
 research questions and planning operational logistics.
 They were active collaborators on our accompanying
 qualitative research and process evaluations, including
 validating the analysis and formulating recommenda-
 tions. 13 14 21 25–28 The Indashyikirwa programme and the
 impact evaluation were overseen by a programme advi-
 sory committee chaired by the Rwandan Ministry of
 Gender and Family Planning (MIGEPROF), with active
 engagement of civil society representatives. Findings
 presented here were workshopped in Rwanda with stake-
 holders from civil society, government, multilateral agen-
 cies and research organisations before submission for
 publication.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> In total, 1660 women (828 intervention and 832 control)
 were successfully enrolled in the impact evaluation at
 baseline (98.8% of the target of 1680). Among men,
 1651 participants (821 intervention and 830 control)
 
<section> BMJ Global Health
 
<section> enrolled (98.3% of the target of 1680). Recruitment took
 place during a predefined period from 23 November
 2015 to 13 January 2016; intervention participants were
 recruited before control participants to ensure that base-
 line data collection could be completed in advance of a
 target implementation date set by the Rwandan Ministry
 of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF) in their
 role coordinating the programme advisory committee.
 Figure 2 describes the retention of study participants over
 time. At 12 months, overall retention of women was 99.0%
 with slightly more intervention than control participants
 interviewed (99.6% vs 98.3%, p=0.004). At 24 months,
 97.4% of women were retained, again with slightly higher
 retention in the intervention than control arm (98.4%
 vs 96.4%, p=0.007). Among men, overall retention was
 96.7% at 12 months and 93.0% at 24 months, with no
 significant difference between study arms. In total, 1647
 women and 1622 men contributed data at one or both
 follow-­up time points and were included in our outcome
 modelling.
 Table 2 describes the sociodemographic character-
 istics of participants at baseline. Among both women
 and men, participants in the control arm were more
 likely to report that both spouses belonged to a VSLA.
 Among women, 35.3% of intervention versus 47.6% of
 control participants reported that both spouses were
 VSLA members (p=0.02); whereas among men, the
 difference was 46.7% intervention versus 57.4% control
 (p=0.04).

<section> Table 3 describes baseline demographic characteristics
 associated with loss to follow-­up. Among women, those lost
 to follow-­up had lower household assets scores at baseline
 (p=0.004) and were more likely to have reported expe-
 riences of physical or sexual IPV with a previous partner
 
<section> (20.9% vs 12.8%, p=0.05). Among men, those lost to
 follow-­up were more likely to have been cohabiting versus
 legally married at baseline (p=0.003), had lower baseline
 scores on household assets (p=0.02) and were more likely to
 report being beaten often or very often as a child (p=0.02).

<section> BMJ Global Health 
<section> Primary outcome
 The results of all outcome models for women are given in
 table 4 and for men in table 5. Women who participated
 in the couples’ curriculum, compared with women in the
 control, reported a significant reduction in experience of
 physical and/or sexual IPV at both the interim 12-­month
 point and the final 24-­month time point (aRR=0.44; 95%
 CI 0.34 to 0.59). Men who participated in the couples’
 curriculum also reported a significant reduction in
 perpetration of physical and/or sexual IPV compared
 with men in the control, again at both the interim assess-
 ment and with a significant intervention effect sustained
 at 24 months (aRR=0.54; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.75).
 
<section> Secondary outcomes
 
<section> Secondary outcomes: IPV-related
 Among the women in the couples’ cohort who reported
 no experience of IPV in the 12 months prior to the
 intervention, there was a significant reduction in IPV in
 the intervention versus control group at the 12-­month
 midpoint, but this was non-­ significant by 24 months
 (aRR=0.74; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.17). Among the women
 who did report experience of IPV at baseline, there was
 a significant reduction in intervention vs control at both
 the 12-­month midpoint and the final 24-­month assess-
 ment (aRR=0.35; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.61). Among the men
 in the couples’ cohort who reported no perpetration of
 IPV in the 12 months prior to the intervention, there was
 a marginally significant reduction in IPV in the interven-
 tion vs control group at the 12-­month midpoint, but this
 was non-­significant by 24 months. Among men who did
 report perpetration of IPV at baseline, there was a signif-
 icant reduction in the intervention versus control group
 at both the 12-­month midpoint and the final 24-­month
 assessment (aRR=0.35; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72).
 Female intervention participants compared with
 control group participants reported less experience of
 any physical IPV, any forced or coerced sex (sexual IPV),
 and any economic abuse at both the 12-­month interim
 assessment and the final 24-­ month timepoint; experi-
 ence of emotional aggression was significantly reduced at
 the 24-­month endpoint only. Among male participants,
 there was a significant reduction in perpetration of phys-
 ical IPV at the 12-­month interim measure that was non-­
 significant by the 24-­month final assessment. In contrast,
 there was a significant impact on the perpetration of
 forced or coerced sex (sexual IPV) that was sustained at
 the 24-­month final assessment. There was no difference
 between the intervention and control groups on men’s
 self-­reported perpetration of economic abuse.
 Among women who reported children under
 residing in the household and had experienced phys-
 ical or sexual IPV in the past 12 months, there were
 significant reductions in reports of children witnessing
 the mother being beaten that were significant at both
 the 12-­month interim measures and the final 24-­month
 assessment. There was no significant difference between
 the intervention and control arms on the rate of help
 seeking among women who had experienced any phys-
 ical or sexual IPV in the past 12 months.
 
<section> Secondary outcomes: relationship quality
 Both women and men in the intervention arm compared
 with the control arm reported statistically significant
 improvements in measures of relationship quality, with
 decreased scores for the level of conflict in the relation-
 ship, and increased scores on effective conflict manage-
 ment strategies, with improvements at both 12 and 24
 months. Female intervention participants were also more
 likely to report the maximum possible score on measures
 of couple communication and trust at both the interim
 12-­month and the final 24-­month assessments. Among
 men, the intervention versus control participants showed
 significant improvements in couple communication at
 both time points, but no significant difference in percep-
 tion of trust at either time point.
 
<section> Secondary outcomes: beliefs and community engagement
 Female and male intervention participants versus control
 group participants both reported significant reductions
 in the number of reasons endorsed to justify wife beating
 at both time points. Female intervention participants also
 reported significantly increased scores on self-­ efficacy
 for community engagement at both time points (not
 assessed for men). Men reported an increase in giving
 advice to neighbours about relationships at both 12 and
 24 months, but only reported increased confidence for
 doing so at 24 months. Both female and male interven-
 tion participants reported increases in actions to prevent
 IPV at both time points. Among men, those who self-­
 reported participation in the activist training were more
 likely to report this at 24 months than those reported
 participating in the couple’s training only, but this differ-
 ence was non-­significant for women.
 
<section> Exploratory outcomes
 
<section> Exploratory outcomes: household economic status
 Male and female intervention participants both reported
 increased cash income and household food security,
 the latter accompanied by overall reductions in house-
 hold scores for hunger. Both reported a slight increase
 in payment of any household debt in the last month at
 the interim 12-­month assessment, but there was no differ-
 ence at 24 months.
 
<section> Exploratory outcomes: parenting
 Both women and men in the intervention arm reported
 significantly less endorsement of physical discipline in
 raising children and significantly reduced frequency of
 smacking or beating children in the home as compared
 with the control arm. These benefits were present at both
 the 12-­month interim assessment and the final 24-­month
 assessment.
 
<section> Exploratory outcomes: health related
 Both women and men in the intervention arm versus
 control were more likely to report ‘good’ or ‘excellent’

<section> health at both 12-­ month and 24-­ month assessments.
 While PTSD symptoms were not initially assessed, they
 were added as an exploratory outcome from midline
 at the request of the programme partners. Both men
 and women in the intervention versus control groups
 reported significantly fewer PTSD symptoms at both the
 12-­month and 24-­month time points.
 Female intervention participants compared with
 control group participants reported significantly lower
 scores on the CES-­D 10 short form measuring depressive
 symptoms with improvements at both interim and final
 assessments. Male intervention versus control partici-
 pants also showed significant reductions in CES-­ D
 short scores at both time points. There was no significant
 change in the level of problematic alcohol use (AUDIT-­C
 score>=4) reported by male participants, although there
 was a non-­significant reduction.
 
<section> Harms
 
<section> A total of 14 deaths occurred (5 women and 9 men), with
 no differences by study arm. One participant was trans-
 ported for medical attention after a fall at a data collec-
 tion site that was precipitated by an illness. This acci-
 dent and all deaths were investigated, reported to ethics
 committees and found to be unrelated to trial participa-
 tion. The number of participants referred to the study
 counsellor was consistently low, with many requesting
 counselling for events unrelated to study participation.
 Participants referred were 1.6% of women at baseline,
 1.2% of women at midline and 0.5% of women at endline
 with no significant different between study arms; <0.2%
 of men at all timepoints.
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> This impact evaluation found substantial and statisti-
 cally significant overall reductions in the experience of
 physical and/or sexual IPV at 24 months of follow-­up
 among both women (aRR=0.45; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.60)
 and men (aRR=0.53; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.75) who partic-
 ipated in the Indashyikirwa couple’s curriculum, which
 represents a substantial achievement in the prevention
 of IPV. Detailed results for female participants show
 statistically significant reductions in both physical IPV
 and sexual IPV, while for men, significant reductions
 in reported perpetration were achieved only for sexual
 IPV at 24 months. Similarly, women participating in the
 couple’s curriculum reported significantly lower risk of
 experiencing economic abuse not paralleled by men’s
 reports. The discordance between findings among male
 and female participants in a couple’s evaluation is not
 uncommon, 29 30 and likely reflects some combination
 of normal differences in perception of events between
 partners in a relationship and greater willingness to
 report IPV by women. Data from our qualitative research
 with couples support this interpretation, where women
 were also more likely to report experiencing sexual IPV
 than men were to report perpetrating it, especially at
 baseline. 28 However, by the endline interviews, men and
 women had much more concordant responses around
 IPV, with a particular increase in the concordance of
 sexual IPV. This was linked to similar processes of change
 in response to Indashyikirwa, including greater awareness
 of various types and consequences of IPV. 28 It is notable
 that, per the secondary analysis, the intervention appears
 to have been more effective at reducing recurrence of
 IPV among couples who reported IPV in the year prior
 to baseline than it was at preventing a first occurrence
 of IPV, although this may have been an issue of statistical
 power as there is a clear trend towards benefit for both
 groups.
 The findings regarding overall reductions in IPV are
 bolstered by the findings from both men and women
 regarding overall improvements in relationship quality.
 These include decreased relationship conflict, improved
 conflict management and increased communication
 among couples attending the curriculum sessions.
 Female participants also reported increased perception
 of trust, care and respect with their partners; that this
 was not mirrored for men likely reflects the higher base-
 line scores on the measure among them. The qualitative
 research helps unpack reasons for these improvements,
 including couples spending greater and more quality
 time together through co-­ completing the curriculum,
 the relationship skills building sessions and use of take-­
 home exercises; the four types of power framework,
 and the positive, inspiring approach of the curriculum
 to build healthier, more equitable relationships. 25 This
 is important given the consideration of relationship
 quality as a main pathway for healthy behaviours within
 couples, 31 and the evidence that lower quality relation-
 ships can be more prone to violence. 32
 Women and men who participated in the couple’s
 curriculum also decreased their endorsement of various
 justifications for wife beating. Women showed increased
 self-­efficacy to engage with community processes; men
 showed increased confidence and engagement in
 advising their neighbours on their relationships, and both
 reported increased participation in actions to prevent
 IPV. The latter outcome was especially high among those
 who self-­reported engaging as activists after the comple-
 tion of the couples training. According to the qualita-
 tive data, the majority of intervention couples expressed
 commitment and confidence to prevent and respond
 to IPV in their communities, and a desire to share their
 benefits and learnings from the curriculum. 25 Indeed, far
 more couples than allowed for in the budget expressed
 strong interest in serving as Indashyikirwa community
 activists, and a large number of individuals spontaneously
 engaged in activist and other outreach activities either
 on their own or through supporting spouses who had
 undertaken the formal activist training; these activities
 were encouraged through the programme.
 An important exploratory outcome of the couples’
 curriculum was the benefits accrued to children in the
 intervention households. In addition to the overall 
<section> reduction in IPV taking place between parents, mothers
 who did experience physical and/or sexual IPV reported
 significant reductions in abuse being witnessed by chil-
 dren. In addition, both women and men decreased their
 endorsement of corporal punishment of children and
 reported reduced frequency of smacking or beating chil-
 dren in the household. This is important not only for
 the well-­being of children but also for long-­term future
 prevention of IPV. It is well known that witnessing abuse
 of a mother and experiencing harsh physical punish-
 ments in childhood are strong risk factors for both
 experience (among women) and perpetration (among
 men) of IPV later in life. 4 The qualitative data affirm
 that negative implications of IPV for children were iden-
 tified through the couples’ curriculum and provided a
 powerful platform to promote the value of non-­violence
 within families. 25
 Other important benefits of couple’s participa-
 tion in Indashyikirwa included improvements in both
 mental and physical health. Both men and women
 reported reductions in depressive symptoms on the
 CES-­D 10 scale and improvements in self-­rated health.
 While these results should be interpreted with caution
 given that both measures are indicative rather than
 diagnostic, they are highly plausible correlates of the
 reported improvements in the quality of intimate part-
 nerships and reductions in violence. An additional
 exploratory finding is the lower scores on the Abbre-
 viated PTSD Checklist–Civilian 35 36 in the intervention
 versus control couples at both midline and endline.
 This finding must be interpreted with extreme caution
 as we did not assess this construct at baseline, but
 taken together with other findings, it affirms the likely
 benefit of the couples’ curriculum for participants’
 health. To the extent that the Indashyikirwa couples’
 curriculum leads to improved health, it is possible that
 additional benefits in terms of increased productivity
 and decreased healthcare expenditures could ensue.
 A final very important benefit of participating in
 Indashyikirwa versus the standard VSLA alone was the
 improvements shown in household well-­ being in the
 form of increased income and reduced hunger—also
 measured as an increase in households considered food
 secure. There are two possible explanations for this
 finding, both of which may be simultaneously true. First,
 the couple’s curriculum included explicit content on the
 value of women’s economic empowerment and strategies
 for shared decision-­making around finances. According
 to the qualitative data, reflecting on the benefits of
 shared economic decision-­making was a powerful alter-
 native to the hegemonic social norm of men holding the
 primary economic decision-­making power. 26 It is quite
 plausible that improving couples’ ability to function as
 cooperative economic partners could have improved the
 overall economic standing of Indashyikirwa households.
 In addition, participants in the couple’s curriculum were
 paid a stipend of RWF 2000 per person (approximately
 US$2) per session which for many households was a large
 jump in monthly income; we note that only about half of
 women and three-­quarters of men reported any earned
 income in the past month at baseline. According to the
 qualitative data, many couples made household invest-
 ments using this stipend, including purchasing bicycles,
 livestock and roofing, and emphasised that these improve-
 ments were possible through the combined impact of the
 stipend and the more equitable financial planning and
 decision-­ making skills they learnt through the curric-
 ulum. 37 Future efforts to scale up, adapt or implement
 Indashyikirwa should attempt to tease out the impact of
 the curriculum on economic development versus the
 impact of any participation stipends, which may well have
 functioned here as conditional cash transfers.
 
<section> Strengths and limitations
 As with all projects, this impact evaluation has a number
 of limitations and a number of strengths. First, all
 measures rely on self-­reports, making them subject to
 under-­reporting and disclosure bias. Although repeat
 interviews over time are one way to improve disclo-
 sure of IPV, no method completely solves the problem
 of under-­reporting. 38 There may be social desirability
 bias around participants wanting to report favourably
 on an intervention they clearly valued or emphasise
 what they learnt. We attempted to mitigate this possi-
 bility by using anonymous reporting through ACASI
 data collection, which most participants seemed to
 find highly acceptable. There is a wealth of evidence
 that suggests that ACASI encourages more truthful
 and forthcoming reporting compared with face-­to-­face
 interviews or self-­ administered methods for stigma-
 tised topics, 39 40 although exceptions have been docu-
 mented. 41 Analysis of disclosure of key variables found
 no difference in prevalence of IPV whether partic-
 ipants completed the interviews via ACASI or face to
 face, so at minimum we are confident that ACASI did
 not decrease reporting. We also attempted to mitigate
 social desirability effects by using field researchers who
 were external to the programme and emphasising the
 confidentiality of all answers. Couples who volunteer,
 especially for programmes requiring long-­term commit-
 ments, may be more likely than others to benefit and
 see improvements in their relationships. 12 25 We were
 unable to blind participants to the study assignment at
 the enrolment phase, so this may have resulted in some
 differential recruitment between arms. While the inter-
 vention and control participants were demographically
 similar at baseline, the two study arms asked partici-
 pants to volunteer for different tasks(participating in a
 22 session curriculum versus research interviews only)
 which could have prompted different willingness to
 enrol; control participants were more likely to report
 that both members of the couple belonged to a VSLA,
 suggesting that there may have been some systematic
 difference in who came forward to participate. There
 was some minor differential loss to follow-­up among
 the couple’s cohort participants who were vulnerable 
<section> economically and/or who had experienced violence
 previously; however, this would tend to bias our find-
 ings towards the null hypothesis. Moreover, our excel-
 lent cohort retention served to mitigate any significant
 impact of differential loss to follow-­up on the findings.
 Overall, the triangulation of reports from both part-
 ners, as well as with the qualitative data, enhances the
 validity and strength of our findings.
 Finally, while we are confident in our conclusions
 regarding the multifaceted benefits of participation in
 the couples curriculum among our study participants,
 it is important to note that the hypothesised spill-­over
 benefits to the larger community did not occur 13 and that
 the findings of the benefits to these couples may not be
 generalisable to other settings. In this regard, the lessons
 learnt from our detailed process evaluation 21 will help
 the field to gauge which aspects of the overall Indashy-
 ikirwa programme can best be scaled up and adapted to
 other settings.
 
<section> Conclusion
 This study demonstrates that the Indashyikirwa couples
 training curriculum was effective at reducing IPV among
 married and cohabitating male–female couples in rural
 Rwanda. In addition to reducing IPV in the intervention
 versus control arm, the programme showed numerous
 benefits in reduced conflict, improved conflict manage-
 ment, improved mental and physical health, improved
 economic status and reduced exposure of children to
 violence. This programme demonstrates that interven-
 tion with couples in the Global South can be both safe and
 beneficial, especially within the context of a supportive
 intervention, highly trained facilitators and strong
 referral networks. 14 Scale-­up of such programming and
 adaption to other settings should be considered, although
 it will require careful attention to maintaining consistent
 quality in implementation and should be accompanied
 by careful process evaluation. The data emphasise how
 women’s economic empowerment combined with inter-
 ventions supporting relationships skills, and equipping
 couples to jointly identify and manage triggers of IPV and
 conflict, can bring significant changes at the household
 level that are mutually reinforcing.
