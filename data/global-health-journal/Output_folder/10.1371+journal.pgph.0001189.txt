<section> Abstract
 
<section> Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a major source of mortality for children in low resource
 settings. Alternative treatment models that improve acceptability and reduce caregiver bur-
 den are needed to improve treatment access. We assessed costs and cost-effectiveness
 monthly vs. weekly follow-up (standard-of-care) for treating uncomplicated SAM in children
 6–59 months of age. To do so, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of a cluster-ran-
 domized trial of treatment for newly-diagnosed uncomplicated SAM in northwestern Nigeria
 (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT03140904). We collected empirical costing data from enrollment
 to 3 months post-discharge. We quantified health outcomes as the fraction of children recov-
 ered at discharge (primary cost-effectiveness outcome), the fraction recovered 3 months
 post-discharge, and total DALYs due to acute malnutrition. We estimated cost-effectiveness
 from both provider and societal perspectives. Costs are reported in 2019 US dollars. Pro-
 vider costs per child were $67.07 (95% confidence interval: $64.79, $69.29) under stan-
 dard-of-care, and $78.74 ($77.06, $80.66) under monthly follow-up. Patient costs per child
 were $21.04 ($18.18, $23.51) under standard-of-care, and $14.16 ($12.79, $15.25) under
 monthly follow-up. Monthly follow-up performed worse than standard-of-care for each health
 outcome assessed and was dominated (produced worse health outcomes at higher cost)
 the standard-of-care in cost-effectiveness analyses. This result was robust to statistical
 uncertainty and to alternative costing assumptions. These findings provide evidence against
 monthly follow-up for treatment of uncomplicated SAM in situations where weekly follow-up
 of patients is feasible. While monthly follow-up may reduce burdens on caregivers and pro-
 viders, other approaches are needed to do so while maintaining the effectiveness of care.

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Undernutrition is a major cause of pediatric illness and mortality [1], and in 2019 was esti-
 mated to cause 7% (6%, 9%) of all disability-adjusted life years among children aged 1–4 years
 old [2]. Severe acute malnutrition (SAM)—characterized by weight-for-height <3 standard
 deviations below WHO growth standards, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) <115mm,
 and/or nutritional oedema—represents a significant fraction of malnutrition-related deaths
 and a major mortality risk for affected children [3]. Children surviving SAM experience higher
 rates of morbidity, mortality, and other adverse outcomes later in life [4, 5]. In 2020, an esti-
 mated 13.6 (10.6, 16.7) million children under 5 developed SAM [6]. The current approach
 treating SAM in low resource settings combines outpatient treatment with ready-to-use thera-
 peutic foods (RUTF) for uncomplicated cases and inpatient treatment for stabilization of com-
 plicated cases. Early published studies of community-based SAM management showed this
 model to be effective [7–10], and recent systematic reviews [11, 12] have found this approach
 to be equally effective and substantially less costly compared to earlier approaches that
 required routine hospitalization for all SAM cases. However, this community-based approach
 can be difficult to implement in some settings, with the frequent clinic visits required for out-
 patient care—generally conducted weekly or biweekly until program discharge—increasing
 the burden on both service providers and caregivers. The challenges related to frequent clinic
 visits are particularly acute in high-burden, low-resource settings, where provider capacity is
 often limited and patients may face substantial difficulties to attend frequent clinic visits [13].
 It is possible that effective outpatient treatment of uncomplicated SAM can be achieved with
 fewer scheduled clinic visits, thus reducing costs borne by caregivers and healthcare providers.
 Under a monthly follow-up schedule, the gap between scheduled clinic visits would be longer and
 caregivers would be given larger therapeutic food rations at each visit, as well as additional education
 and support when initiating treatment. A pilot study of this approach conducted in Niger found
 that adequate treatment response and use of therapeutic foods was maintained when following a
 monthly schedule of follow-up [14]. In the current study, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis
 as part of a cluster randomized trial of community-based SAM treatment [15] to estimate the costs
 and cost-effectiveness of a strategy of monthly outpatient follow-up for children diagnosed with
 uncomplicated SAM, as compared to weekly outpatient follow-up (the current standard-of-care).
 
<section> Materials and methods
 
<section> Study setting and population
 
<section> This study was conducted in Sokoto state, northwestern Nigeria, a rural area with endemic
 acute malnutrition. In 2018, SAM prevalence in Sokoto was estimated to be 7.9% among chil-
 dren under 5 years old, the highest rate of malnutrition in the country [16]. The study popula-
 tion included children 6–59 months of age who were newly admitted to treatment for
 uncomplicated SAM (mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 115 mm and/or grade 1–2
 edema and absence of current illness requiring inpatient care) at one of 10 outpatient thera-
 peutic feeding centers (OTP) in Binji and Wamako local government areas, between January
 23, 2018 and November 30, 2019. Management of SAM was provided free of charge in all
 study clinics by the Sokoto State Ministry of Health, with support from UNICEF. There was
 no MAM treatment program operational in the study site at the time of enrollment.
 
<section> Intervention and clinical trial
 
<section> Participants received one of two intervention strategies: a “monthly” follow-up strategy, in
 which participants attended clinic visits at weeks 4, 8, 10 and 12 from enrollment until 
<section> discharge with caregiver support at admission for continued home-based surveillance [15, 17],
 or a weekly follow-up strategy (the current standard-of-care), in which participants attended
 standard weekly clinic visits from enrollment to discharge. Scheduled OTP visits included
 medical and anthropometric surveillance and provision of therapeutic feeding rations. All par-
 ticipants received a home visit by a community health worker when a scheduled clinic visit
 was missed to ascertain the reason for absence and encourage the caregiver to return to treat-
 ment. As per study protocol, data to assess sustained recovery were collected at a 3-month
 post-discharge visit (the costs of this post-discharge visit were not included in the cost
 analysis).
 Randomization was conducted at the level of the OTP with a crossover design. The
 OTPs were stratified into 5 groups by size and assigned randomly 1:1 to the monthly follow-
 up or standard-of-care arms. Prior to crossover, all children attending a given OTP received
 the same schedule of follow-up. Following crossover (December 17, 2018), each site switched
 from monthly to weekly follow-up, or vice-versa. Children enrolled before the cross-over con-
 tinued to follow the strategy they were enrolled on. The target sample size in each study arm
 (1750, with 175 per OTP) was calculated to achieve >90% power to detect a noninferiority
 margin difference between the group proportions of −0.10. A detailed description of trial
 design and sample size calculations are provided in Hitchings et al. [15]. This study was regis-
 tered at clinicaltrials.gov (ID NCT03140904).
 
<section> Cost-effectiveness analysis
 
<section> The primary cost-effectiveness endpoint was the incremental cost per child achieving nutri-
 tional recovery under the monthly follow-up strategy, as compared to a weekly follow-up
 (standard-of-care) strategy, from both provider and societal perspectives. We also estimated
 the cost per child treated and the cost per child recovered under each study arm, as well as
 detailed costing results for each intervention activity. In secondary analyses, we report the cost
 per child recovered based on outcomes at 3-months post-discharge and the cost per DALY
 averted based on additional assumptions about survival after trial completion. All costs and
 health outcomes were assumed to occur within a year of intervention enrollment, and no dis-
 counting was applied. We followed published standards for the conduct of the cost-effective-
 ness analysis [18, 19], and reported results using the Consolidated Health Economic
 Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) guidelines [20].
 
<section> Cost data
 
<section> Provider costs were calculated as the resources required to deliver the intervention, excluding
 research costs. These include the costs of enrollment consultations, education sessions (only
 for the monthly follow-up arm), follow-up consultations (scheduled and spontaneous), units
 of therapeutic food provided, dispensed drugs, home visits to trace children after missed
 scheduled consultations, and inpatient bed-days. For each study participant, we recorded the
 number of items and services received, multiplied these quantities by the unit cost for each cat-
 egory, then summed across all categories to estimate total provider costs. Costs for enrollment
 consultations, education sessions and follow-up consultations were based on the cost-per-min-
 ute for clinical care to allow for differences in the duration of these services between study
 arms. This cost-per-minute ($0.42) was calculated by dividing a published outpatient visit unit
 cost (comprising personnel, infrastructure, maintenance and managerial overheads, and other
 operational costs) [21] by the average visit duration. For each visit, the visit duration in min-
 utes was calculated as the difference between the start (caregiver/child enter consultation area)
 and end (caregiver/child exit consultation area, paperwork is complete, area is prepared for

 next patient) times of the clinical encounter. The average visit duration was calculated as the
 sum of these estimates divided by the number of visits. In scenario analyses we examined alter-
 native unit cost estimates. Unit cost estimates are shown in Table 1.
 Patient costs were defined as disease-related costs borne by the families of study partici-
 pants during follow-up. These were calculated as the out-of-pocket spending reported by care-
 givers as a consequence of seeking care, including care obtained from providers not included
 in the study, as well as the opportunity cost of caregiver time spent attending clinic visits and
 during a child’s hospitalization. Patient costs associated with outpatient care were collected
 through a costing sub-study conducted among caregivers. For each caregiver included in this
 costing sub-study, interviews were conducted at all scheduled clinic visits, as well as at
 3-month post-discharge follow-up visit to collect costs incurred after treatment. Patient costs
 for inpatient care were collected through a sub-study conducted among caregivers of hospital-
 ized patients, with interviews conducted daily during the period of hospitalization. Out-of-
 pocket costs included medical costs (medicines, diagnostic tests, other care) and non-medical
 costs (transportation, food, care for dependents, and other items). In the clinical trial, patients 
<section> were reimbursed for out-of-pocket medical and transportation costs for hospital care. These were
 included as patient costs for the cost analysis, as they would not typically be reimbursed during
 routine care in this setting. The opportunity cost of caregiver time was calculated by summing the
 number of minutes spent by caregivers traveling to or attending clinic and hospital care over the
 course of treatment, and multiplying by a unit cost per hour, which was based on the Nigerian
 national minimum wage (Table 1). All costs were inflated to 2019 values using the GDP deflator
 as a price index [22], and converted into US dollars using market exchange rates.
 
<section> Effectiveness outcomes
 
<section> Nutritional recovery (used to report the cost per child recovered) was defined at or before
 weeks from admission as being free from medical complications, MUAC � 125 mm for 2 con-
 secutive visits, and no edema if admitted with edema at study discharge. Children who
 defaulted (defined as 3 missed scheduled clinic visits in the weekly follow-up group and 1
 missed scheduled clinic visit in the monthly follow-up group), transferred to inpatient care,
 died, or were lost to follow-up for other reasons before study discharge were treated as not
 recovered. We also estimated outcomes using an alternative definition of recovery based on
 outcomes at 3-months post-discharge. This outcome, sustained recovery, required that chil-
 dren be classified as recovered at study discharge (as described above), and additionally to
 have not died, been hospitalized, or relapsed by the 3-month post-discharge visit. S1 Table pro-
 vides summary results for major effectiveness endpoints, as reported in Hitchings et al. [15].
 In addition to these empirical outcomes we estimated the average number of disability-
 adjusted life years (DALYs) due to SAM for individuals in each intervention arm, based on
 methods described in Isanaka et al. [23]. Under this approach we considered observed mortal-
 ity during the trial (up to the 3-month post-discharge visit) as well as expected mortality after
 the trial until 12 months post-enrollment, which was calculated by imposing different disease-
 specific mortality rates depending on whether an individual was classified as recovered by the
 3-month post-discharge visit. These were multiplied by life expectancy estimates taken from
 the Global Burden of Disease Study reference life table [24] (Table 1). All mortality attributable
 to the SAM episode was assumed to occur in the 12 months following study enrollment.
 
<section> Statistical analyses
 
<section> The incremental cost per child recovered was calculated as the difference in the mean cost per
 participant between study arms, divided by the difference in the mean probability of recovery
 between study arms (monthly follow-up compared to standard-of-care). For the provider per-
 spective, we included provider costs incurred between study enrollment and discharge. For
 societal perspective, we included these costs as well as patient costs incurred over the same
 period. For the alternative outcomes with a longer analytic horizon (sustained recovery by
 3-month post-discharge and DALYs), we additionally considered patient and provider costs
 incurred between discharge and the 3-month post-discharge visit. We estimated uncertainty
 in analytic outcomes using a non-parametric bootstrap at the cluster level [18, 25] with 10,000
 iterations, and reported this uncertainty with equal-tailed 95% confidence intervals, two-sided
 p-values for differences between study arms, scatterplots on the cost-effectiveness plane, and
 cost-effectiveness acceptability curves [26, 27]. All analyses were conducted with R (version
 
<section> 4.0.3) [28].
 
<section> Scenario analyses
 
<section> We tested the robustness of results to several alternative assumptions: (1) exclusion of home
 visit costs, as these home visits may not be provided outside of the study setting; (2) a lower 
<section> cost per minute for clinic visits ($0.02 per minute, based on clinical staffing costs alone); (3)
 higher cost per minute for clinic visits ($1.37 per minute, based on an earlier study of commu-
 nity-based management of acute malnutrition in northern Nigeria [29]); (4) a lower hospital
 bed-day cost ($1.72 per day, based on an earlier study of community-based management of
 acute malnutrition in northern Nigeria [29]); (5) drug dispensing assumed to follow the
 national protocol, whereby each child receives albendazole, amoxicillin, and vitamin A, and
 additionally assuming that 50% would also get 1 dose of measles vaccine; (6) a lower cost per
 minute applied to education sessions ($0.02 per minute, based on clinical staffing costs alone);
 and (7) a lower cost per minute applied to education sessions ($0.02 per minute) and addition-
 ally assuming that therapeutic food costs in the intervention arm would be the same as in the
 control arm. Total cost estimates were recalculated under each of these seven alternative
 assumptions.
 
<section> Ethics statement
 
<section> The study was reviewed and approved by research ethics committees at the Harvard T.H.
 Chan School of Public Health (reference number: IRB17-0221) and the Sokoto State Ministry
 of Health, Nigeria (reference number: SMH/1580/V.IV). An independent data and safety
 monitoring board monitored study progress. Caregivers of study participants provided written
 informed consent before admission and were made aware of their ability to withdraw from the
 study at any time.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> There were 3788 children enrolled in the clinical study with a recorded outcome at program
 discharge (1802 in the standard-of-care arm, 1976 in the monthly follow-up arm) and 3594
 children with an outcome recorded at study discharge at 3 months post-program discharge
 (1721 in standard-of-care, 1873 in monthly follow-up). Of these children, 1031 were included
 in the outpatient costing sub-study and 686 in the inpatient costing sub-study. Additional
 
<section> details are provided in Fig
 
<section> Effectiveness outcomes for cost-effectiveness analysis
 
<section> Full results of the effectiveness analysis are described in Hitchings et al. [15]. The standard-of-
 care performed better for each effectiveness outcome. The proportion of all children recovered
 by intervention discharge was 58.8% (95% confidence interval: 54.5, 63.1) under standard-of-
 care and 52.4% (49.0, 56.3) under monthly follow-up, a difference of 6.3 percentage points
 (2.9, 10.0, p<0.001). The proportion of all children classified as recovered at 3 months post-
 discharge was 54.6% (51.1, 58.3) under standard-of-care and 49.3% (45.5, 53.1) under monthly
 follow-up, a difference of 5.3 percentage points (2.2, 9.0, p<0.001). We estimated 6.0 (4.9, 7.1)
 DALYs per child under standard-of-care and 8.0 (6.7, 9.4) under monthly follow-up, a differ-
 ence of 2.0 (1.0, 3.1, p<0.001) DALYs per child.
 
<section> Service utilization and provider costs
 
<section> Among children who recovered, the time between enrollment and program discharge was
 greater in the monthly follow-up group compared to standard-of-care (67.4 days vs. 51.2 days,
 p<0.001). For the standard-of-care approach, there was an average 8.5 (8.1, 8.9) scheduled
 consultations (including the enrollment visit) per child, and 4.2 (4.1, 4.3) under monthly fol-
 low-up (p-value for difference between arms <0.001). There was little difference in the average
 number of unscheduled consultations per child (0.32 (0.27, 0.38) for standard-of-care, 0.31

<section> (0.25, 0.40) for monthly follow-up (p = 0.38). Enrollment consultations took an average 9.7
 (8.8, 10.6) minutes under standard-of-care, and 10.7 (9.3, 12.8) minutes under monthly fol-
 low-up (p = 0.15). Scheduled follow-up consultations took an average 3.4 (3.2, 3.6) minutes
 under standard-of-care and 3.7 (3.2, 4.3) minutes under monthly follow-up (p = 0.17). Total
 time taken for consultations (combining number and duration of consultations) was 36.3
 (32.9, 37.8) minutes under standard-of-care and 23.8 (20.0, 26.3) minutes under monthly fol-
 low-up (p<0.001). Under the monthly follow-up arm caregivers received an education session
 following the enrollment consultation, on average taking 43.7 minutes (39.4, 48.9). For home
 visits conducted when a scheduled clinic visit was missed, there were an average 0.52 (0.39,
 0.66) visits per child under standard-of-care, and 0.22 (0.17, 0.28) under monthly follow-up
 <0.001). Each home visit took an average of 62.2 (58.5, 66.3) minutes of staff time, including
 travel to the household. Under the standard-of-care there was an average 147 (141, 153) thera-
 peutic food sachets dispensed during the course of treatment, and an average 184 (180, 187)
 sachets under monthly follow-up (p<0.001). During treatment there was an average 10.9 (6.6,
 15.6) hospitalizations per 100 children under standard-of-care, and 9.5 (6.8, 12.1) under
 monthly follow-up (p = 0.30). The average duration of hospitalization was 4.0 (2.5, 5.0) days
 for standard-of-care, and 3.9 (2.8, 5.3) days under monthly follow-up (p = 0.54). Table 2
 reports the provider costs associated with these services by cost category and study arm. Total
 provider costs per child were $67.07 ($65.79, $69.29) for standard-of-care and $78.74 ($77.06, 
<section> $80.66) for monthly follow-up (p<0.001). Provider costs per child achieving nutritional recov-
 ery were $114.13 ($104.70, $125.04) under standard-of-care and $150.19 ($138.48, $163.05)
 under monthly follow-up (p<0.001).
 
<section> Patient costs
 
<section> Outpatient costs were estimated from 6374 interviews conducted at scheduled clinic visits and
 3-month post-discharge follow-up in a sub-sample of 1054 study caregivers. Across study
 arms, the average patient out-of-pocket cost per outpatient visit was $0.21 (0.20, 0.22). These
 costs incurred during study outpatient visits were categorized as transport (91.8%), food
 (6.4%), out-of-pocket spending for medicines or medical supplies, tests or other procedures
 (1.4%), dependent care (0.3%), and accommodation (0.1%). Costs incurred seeking care from
 providers not affiliated with the study (predominantly private pharmacies, mobile pharmacies,
 and other government-run outpatient clinics) were estimated as $1.17 (0.77, 1.58) per child
 under standard-of-care, and $1.09 (0.75, 1.54) per child under monthly follow-up. This spend-
 ing on care outside of study outpatient visits was devoted to purchasing medicines (67.9%),
 transport (21.1%), food (5.8%), clinical tests (4.9%), and other care (0.2%). Over the course of
 treatment, caregivers spent an average of 31 (27, 35) hours attending clinic visits under stan-
 dard-of-care, and 19 (17, 20) hours under monthly follow-up (p<0.001). Across study arms
 this averaged 3.7 (3.6, 3.8) hours per visit (3.5 (3.4, 3.6) under standard-of-care, and 4.1 (4.0,
 4.3) under monthly follow-up, p<0.001). Between discharge and 3-month post-discharge fol-
 low-up, caregivers reported incurring additional out-of-pocket costs averaging $0.80 (0.70,
 0.89) per child under standard-of-care, and $0.69 (0.59, 0.79) per child under monthly follow-
 up (p = 0.05). This spending after program discharge was devoted to medicines (68.4%), trans-
 port (22.0%), clinical tests (4.5%), food (3.7%), and other items (1.4%). Patient costs from hos-
 pitalization were collected through 2322 interviews with a sub-sample of 743 caregivers of
 hospitalized patients. Across study arms average out-of-pocket costs were $10.06 ($9.26,
 $10.92) per hospital stay, and $4.20 ($3.95, $4.45) per bed-day. These costs were primarily for
 medicines, medical supplies, diagnostic tests or procedures (72.1%). Other costs included
 transport (13.9%), food (12.4%), dependent care (0.8%), and other costs (0.8%). Caregivers in
 the trial were reimbursed for out-of-pocket medical and transportation costs for hospital care.
 These were included as patient costs for the present cost analysis. Table 2 reports patient costs
 by cost category and study arm. Total patient costs per child were $21.04 ($18.18, $23.51) for
 standard-of-care and $14.16 ($12.79, $15.23) for monthly follow-up (p<0.001). Patient costs
 per child achieving nutritional recovery were $35.80 ($27.85, $39.61) under standard-of-care
 and $27.01 ($22.19, $27.22) under monthly follow-up (p<0.001).
 Summing provider and patient costs, societal costs per child were $88.11 ($83.61, $91.60)
 for standard-of-care and $92.91 ($90.58, $95.38) for monthly follow-up (p = 0.03). Societal
 costs per child achieving nutritional recovery were $149.93 ($135.35, $166.19) under standard-
 of-care and $177.21 ($164.02, $192.22) under monthly follow-up (p<0.001).

 effectiveness ratio cannot be calculated.
 Similar results were obtained for the secondary outcome of sustained recovery at 3-months
 post-discharge. For this outcome, monthly follow-up had higher provider costs (difference
 $11.74 ($9.70, $13.52, p<0.001)), higher societal costs (difference $4.78 ($0.98, $9.06,
 p<0.001)), and lower sustained recovery (difference 5.3 percentage points (2.2, 9.0, p<0.001))
 compared to standard-of-care, and consequently monthly follow-up was dominated under
 both provider and societal perspectives. Monthly follow-up was also predicted to produce 2.0
 (1.0, 3.1, p<0.001) additional DALYs per child compared to standard-of-care and was domi-
 nated for this outcome. Fig 3 compares costs and health benefits for the cost per DALY
 averted. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve calculated from these results showed that
 monthly follow-up had <1% probability of being cost-effective for a wide range of willingness-
 to-pay values, ranging from $10-$10,000 per DALY averted.

<section> be equal) produced substantial cost reductions for monthly follow-up relative to standard-of-
 care, such that the per-child cost of monthly follow-up was equivalent to (Scenario 6) and
 lower than (Scenario 7) the standard-of-care. Other scenarios had a minimal impact on cost
 estimates compared to the main analysis.
 Of all these scenarios, monthly follow-up was not dominated in Scenario 7 (lower education
 session unit cost and therapeutic food costs assumed to be equal), and therefore a cost-effec-
 tiveness ratio could be calculated. Specifically, in this scenario monthly follow-up had lower
 health outcomes and lower costs compared to standard-of-care, and in this situation the cost-
 effectiveness ratio describes the cost-effectiveness of the standard-of-care, as compared to
 monthly follow-up. For this comparison, the incremental cost per child recovered was $198
 ($99, $481), the incremental cost per child achieving sustained recovery was $257 ($115, $706)
 and the incremental cost per DALY averted was $6.76 ($4.12, $13.26).
 
<section> Discussion
 
<section> In this study we examined the costs and cost-effectiveness of a monthly follow-up approach
 for treatment of uncomplicated SAM in children 6–59 months of age, as compared to a stan-
 dard-of-care protocol that required weekly clinic visits until program discharge. We found
 that the monthly follow-up approach was successful in reducing the costs borne by caregivers
 to receive SAM care for their child, with the number of clinic visits, the total time spent attend-
 ing care, and total patient costs all substantially lower in the monthly follow-up arm compared
 to standard-of-care. Monthly follow-up also resulted in lower provider costs for clinical con-
 sultations, but it produced higher total provider costs per child, driven primarily by higher
 costs of therapeutic food, as well as the costs of an educational session that was not provided

<section> up arm was also found to produce worse health outcomes compared to standard-of-care [15],
 with lower nutritional recovery at program discharge and greater cumulative mortality by
 months post-discharge. As a consequence, the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis con-
 cluded that monthly follow-up was dominated by the standard-of-care, indicating that it pro-
 duced worse health outcomes at higher cost and should not be adopted under any cost-
 effectiveness threshold. These results were robust to statistical uncertainty and were qualita-
 tively similar across most of the different alternative assumptions examined in scenario analy-
 ses. Even under the most favorable set of alternative assumptions for the costs of monthly
 follow-up (Scenario 7, with lower unit costs for the education session and therapeutic food
 costs assumed equal across arms), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for standard-of-care
 compared to monthly follow-up is below $10 per DALY averted, which is well below the
 threshold at which an intervention would be deemed cost-effective according to conventional
 criteria [30, 31] and suggests that the standard-of-care should be preferred. Moreover, as
 adopting monthly follow-up would involve worse health outcomes, some have argued that
 such changes must meet more stringent criteria than interventions that improve health [32,
 33].
 An unexpected finding of the cost analysis was that monthly follow-up had higher provider
 costs than standard-of-care. The major reason for this—greater dispensing of therapeutic food
 under the monthly follow-up arm—highlights the substantial resources devoted to therapeutic
 foods, which represent over 50% of total societal costs and over 70% of provider costs across
 both arms. The reason for greater therapeutic food dispensing with monthly follow-up was the
 need to provide caregivers with sufficient food during the extended period until the next
 scheduled visit. Under the standard-of-care, weekly visits allowed more precise control of the
 amount of therapeutic food dispensed, reducing potential waste. Future modifications to SAM
 treatment protocols could be designed to make more efficient use of more expensive program
 inputs, including therapeutic foods. Another notable finding was the substantial costs faced
 caregivers to obtain care—representing almost 25% of total societal costs under the standard-
 of-care arm. Most of these costs attributable to the time spent by caregivers travelling to and
 waiting for clinical consultations, even though these consultations last less than 5 minutes on
 average. This result underlines concerns about the burdens placed on caregivers to receive
 care, one of the motivations for this study. In this study, the cost per child for each study arm
 was lower than other values reported in other analyses of community SAM treatment [34–36],
 including an earlier analysis from the same setting [29]. This may be related to the exclusion
 program support costs such as staff training and supervision in our analysis—these were
 assumed to be common to both study arms and so omitted from the incremental analysis but
 can contribute a significant fraction of total intervention costs [37].
 Alternative approaches should remain under consideration to reduce caregiver burden
 while promoting clinical recovery. Possible modifications could include adopting a visit fre-
 quency between the approaches tested in this trial (such as weekly follow-up until initial weight
 gain is achieved followed by monthly follow-up until discharge), basing the frequency of fol-
 low-up on an initial clinical risk assessment, or allowing caregivers to play a greater role in
 choosing the frequency of follow-up given full information of the various trade-offs. It is possi-
 ble that these or other modifications could improve efficiency without jeopardizing health
 outcomes.
 This study has several limitations. Firstly, while these results provide evidence against the
 monthly follow-up approach as a replacement for standard-of-care in this setting, they do not
 describe how these results might generalize to other settings. In particular, the health outcomes
 observed for nutritional recovery under both arms in this study were below international stan-
 dards [38] and may be influenced by contextual factors including poor access to care or 
<section> suboptimal home use of RUTF (as discussed by Hitchings et al. [15]), which may vary across
 settings. It is unclear how the cost-effectiveness outcomes reported in this study would change
 in settings with a higher fraction of children achieving nutritional recovery. It is possible that
 different cost-effectiveness results would be obtained in settings where the costs of therapeutic
 food represent a smaller fraction of total costs or where the health risks associated with less fre-
 quent follow-up are lower. Moreover, factors beyond cost-effectiveness (feasibility, acceptabil-
 ity to caregivers) should be considered when selecting the intervention approach. These
 factors might favor monthly follow-up and could be influential in situations where the cost
 and health differences between monthly follow-up and standard-of-care are less stark. Sec-
 ondly, our assessment of health outcomes only collected empirical data up to 3 months after
 the completion of treatment and modelled health outcomes for an additional 12 months.
 While it is unlikely that assessing outcomes over a longer time period would change study
 findings in a major way, doing so would capture any ongoing health effects or differences in
 healthcare utilization beyond the intervention period. Recent systematic reviews [4, 5] have
 demonstrated poorer long-term outcomes among children surviving SAM compared to those
 without a history of SAM, suggesting that more effective SAM treatment may ameliorate these
 long-term effects. Thirdly, it is possible that the present analysis did not fully capture all bene-
 fits of the reduced number outpatient consultations for SAM treatment achieved by the
 monthly follow-up approach. In theory, additional staff time due to fewer consultations per
 patient in the monthly follow-up approach could be spent treating additional SAM patients
 (increasing program coverage), treating more patients with other conditions, or improving
 quality of care. As is conventional for cost-effectiveness analysis, we assumed the reduced staff
 time required to provide monthly follow-up would produce cost savings for the SAM program
 (which are subtracted from the numerator of the cost-effectiveness ratio) rather than addi-
 tional health benefits (which would be added to the denominator of the cost-effectiveness
 ratio). While the indirect health benefits of the monthly follow-up approach are unknown, if
 they could be quantified, it is possible they would produce more favorable cost-effectiveness
 results for the monthly follow-up approach than presented here. Fourthly, we did not compare
 the study arms to a ‘no SAM program’ counterfactual. This would have been unethical within
 the context of the study, yet the comparison itself is not implausible, as SAM treatment is not
 always possible in all settings. Studies that have assessed the cost-effectiveness of community-
 based SAM treatment (as compared to no SAM program) have found it to be highly cost-effec-
 tive in a range of settings [29, 34–36]. In situations where a SAM program cannot be imple-
 mented, some version of the monthly follow-up approach may be practical and would very
 likely be cost-effective, given the high mortality associated with untreated SAM.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> The trial on which this economic analysis is based was conducted in a resource-constrained
 and rural area in northwestern Nigeria, and designed to test whether uncomplicated SAM
 could be effectively treated with a lower intensity of clinical follow-up. If this approach had
 been found to be effective and efficient, it would have allowed greater flexibility in the delivery
 of nutritional treatment in areas with high disease burden and limited healthcare access. While
 it was hypothesized that monthly follow-up could achieve equivalent health outcomes at lower
 cost, we found that this strategy led to both worse health outcomes and higher costs. Generali-
 zation of these findings should proceed with caution given the contextual factors that may
 have influenced health outcomes in this single study. Concerns related to the burden that
 weekly visits place on both caregivers and providers and could potentially be alleviated by
 monthly follow-up remain valid, but the findings from this study suggest that alternative 
<section> approaches may be needed to address this issue. Future modifications to the treatment proto-
 cols for uncomplicated SAM will need to be planned with a full appreciation of the health con-
 sequences that could result if the level of clinical care is insufficient and the need to make
 efficient use of high-cost intervention inputs.
