<section> Research in context
 
<section> Evidence before this study
 We searched PubMed for economic evaluations alongside
 clinical studies that assessed multicomponent early child
 development (ECD) interventions in low-income and middle-
 income countries published between Jan 1, 2000, and
 Dec 31, 2021. The key search terms were “economic
 evaluation”, “early childhood development”, and “low- and
 middle-income countries” with no language restriction.
 Additionally, we undertook backward citation searching to
 supplement database searching.
 
<section> Four relevant studies were identified: a study from Pakistan
 published in 2014, two studies from India and China in 2020,
 and a study from Kenya in 2021. In Pakistan, early childhood
 interventions that include responsive stimulation were more
 cost-effective than a nutrition intervention alone in
 promoting ECD. Mother and child group sessions in India were
 as effective as home visiting at a lower cost. In addition, the
 integration of a parenting intervention within existing
 primary health care in China was cost-effective to improve
 ECD. Lastly, a study from Kenya indicated that the private and
 social returns of a parenting intervention are likely to largely
 outweigh its costs.
 
<section> The existing evidence notes that ECD interventions are more
 likely to be cost-effective. However, we did not find any
 relevant studies from Viet Nam, and the small number of
 studies suggests that there is scarce economic evidence.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 Our study estimated the cost-effectiveness of the Learning
 Clubs multicomponent ECD intervention compared with the
 cost-effective, but more research is needed to understand
 their economic value and ways to promote optimal
 resource allocation.
 The General Statistics Office of Viet Nam and UNICEF
 have measured Viet Nam’s progress towards realising the
 SDG indicators for children and women in 2020–21.
 There were skilled attendants at 96% of births, the
 mortality rate in children younger than 5 years was
 14 per 1000 births, and 45% of children younger than
 6 months were exclusively breastfed. 8 Regarding child
 care, only 65% of children aged 24–59 months received
 early stimulation and responsive care from any adult
 household member, 8 suggesting that more investment in
 this area is needed. Multicomponent interventions are
 recommended to provide nurturing care by targeting
 multiple risks to child developmental potential.
 Implementing multi­ component interventions requires
 resources, and evidence on cost-effectiveness of inter­
 ventions is crucial to guide strategic budgeting and priority
 setting to accelerate ECD especially in resource-constrained
 settings. Thus, this study aimed to estimate the cost-
 effectiveness of the multicomponent ECD Learning Clubs
 intervention done in rural Viet Nam from 2018 to 2021.
 
<section> usual standard of care (pregnancy and child health-care
 services from commune health services) in rural Viet Nam.
 Mothers in the intervention group attended eight group
 sessions during pregnancy, had one home visit after giving
 birth, and had 11 group sessions during the first postpartum
 year in addition to the standard of care. The outcomes were
 child cognitive, language, motor, and social–emotional
 development scores at age 2 years. Cost data included
 intervention costs, mothers’ time for participation, and out-
 of-pocket health-care costs.
 The intervention was effective and low cost. Based on the
 recurrent cost, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per
 score increase in child cognitive development was US$14,
 which is around 0·5% of Viet Nam’s gross domestic product
 per capita, alongside other benefits in language and motor
 development. This finding supports the scaling up of this
 intervention in similar socioeconomic settings. In addition, it
 contributes to the scarce economic evidence on investments
 in ECD in resource-constrained settings.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 The current evidence supports the economic benefits of
 investments in ECD. More economic evaluations, including
 studies with long-term time horizons, standardised outcomes
 that combine programme benefits, and equity considerations
 are required for strategic planning and resource allocation to
 reach optimal ECD.
 
<section> Methods
 Study design and participants
 The Learning Clubs trial was a multicomponent
 intervention designed to improve the physical and
 mental health of mothers and the health and
 development of their infants in HaNam, a rural Red
 River delta province in northern Viet Nam. 9 According
 to the protocol, an independent statistician randomly
 selected 84 communes from the HaNam Province list
 of 116 communes, and allocated 42 communes to each
 trial arm using random numbers generated in Stata
 version 9 The number of clusters and sample size
 were calculated using Stata to detect a difference in
 child cognitive development score ≤1 SD at age 2 years
 of 15% in the control group and 8% in the intervention
 group with 80% statistical power, a significance level
 of 0·05, and an intracluster correlation coefficient of
 0·03. 9 Enrolment was completed in 2018, resulting in
 669 mothers from 42 communes in the intervention
 group, and 576 mothers from 42 communes in the
 control group (usual standard of care). Mothers who
 were aged at least 18 years, pregnant, and at a gestation
 of less than 20 weeks, were eligible to participate.

 For discounting, we followed WHO’s methods for the
 economic evaluation of health care-assigned interven­
 tions. 18 Due to the absence of consensus regarding
 discounting health benefits, WHO presented the results
 for two scenarios, one applying a 3% discount rate to
 costs only (main scenario), and the other scenario using
 a 3% discount rate for both health benefits and costs.
 Following a similar approach, we estimated ICERs under
 these two scenarios with a 3% discount rate on costs

 analyses with discount rates of 0% and 5%. All analyses
 used the SAS 9.4 software and Microsoft Excel Office 2019.

 Discussion
 Our findings suggest that the Learning Clubs is a cost-
 effective intervention for promoting ECD compared with
 the usual standard of maternal and child health care in
 rural Viet Nam with a 30-month time horizon. Based on
 recurrent cost, the ICER per score increase in child
 cognitive development was $14 with a 3% discount rate
 to costs, which is around 0·5% of Viet Nam’s GDP per
 capita ($2786). In addition, children in the intervention
 group had better language and motor development with
 the ICERs per score gained of $22 and $20, respectively.
 The ICERs were below the minimum investment
 benchmark for ECD of G20’s initiative and the WHO
 Commission on Macroeconomics and Health’s
 thresholds. When both start-up and recurrent costs were
 considered, the ICER was $68 per score increase in child
 cognitive development. The total intervention cost per
 child, and recurrent cost per child for the 18 month-
 intervention was $273 and $58, respectively.
 The cost-effectiveness of the Learning Clubs
 intervention appears reasonable compared with previous
 economic evaluations done alongside cluster-randomised
 trials in low-income and middle-income countries. An
 early childhood intervention for responsive stimulation
 and nutrition in rural Pakistan was more cost-effective
 than a nutrition or a stimulation intervention alone. The
