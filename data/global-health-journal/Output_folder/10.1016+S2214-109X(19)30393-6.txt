<section> Methods We did a three-arm, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority
 and Kiang East districts of The Gambia. Eligible participants were
 14 weeks and 22 weeks of gestation. We randomly allocated women
 (ie, a daily UN University, UNICEF, and WHO international multiple-micronutrient
 containing 60 mg iron), a 60 mg screen-and-treat approach (ie, daily
 weekly hepcidin was <2·5 µg/L or UNIMMAP without iron if hepcidin
 approach (ie, daily UNIMMAP containing 30 mg iron for 7 days if
 without iron if hepcidin was ≥2·5 µg/L). We used a block design stratified
 (above and below the median amount of haemoglobin on every enrolment
 19–22 weeks). Participants and investigators were unaware of the random
 amount of haemoglobin at day 84 and was measured as the difference
 compared with WHO’s recommended regimen; the non-inferiority
 was assessed in the per-protocol population, which comprised all
 registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN21955180.

<section> Evidence before this study
 Based on regularly updated meta-analyses, WHO recommends
 that pregnant women should take supplements containing
 30–60 mg elemental iron and 400 μg folic acid daily to
 prevent maternal anaemia, puerperal sepsis, low birthweight,
 and preterm birth. If daily supplementation is not acceptable
 because of side-effects, weekly supplementation with 120 mg
 iron and 2800 μg folic acid is a suitable alternative in settings
 where the prevalence of anaemia is less than 20%. Side-effects
 are frequently reported, however, and contribute to poor
 adherence. An additional concern is that iron might
 predispose to gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and
 infections. We reasoned that a screen-and-treat approach to
 combat anaemia in pregnancy would be advantageous if it
 could achieve efficacy that was equivalent to or better than
 that achieved by WHO’s recommendations, but at a lower
 overall dose of iron and with fewer side-effects.
 
<section> Added value of this study
 We did a double-blind randomised trial to test two
 hepcidin-guided screen-and-treat approaches against the
 universal daily iron and folic acid supplementation in
 pregnancy, 2 based on evidence from a Cochrane review
 that it provides maternal and neonatal health benefits
 such as prevention of maternal anaemia, puerperal
 sepsis, low birthweight, and preterm birth. The reco-​
 mmended daily dose is 30–60 mg elemental iron, with a
 preferred dose of 60 mg per day in countries where
 anaemia prevalence exceeds 40%. 2 In low-income and
 middle-income countries (LMICs), iron and folic acid
 supplementation has great benefits for iron-deficient
 women 4 and is increasingly being combined in multiple
 micronutrient formulations. 5 However, even when
 supplements are made available, implementation of a
 daily supplementation policy in LMICs is highly variable
 and adherence to a daily regimen is poor, 4–7 attributable in
 large part to common gastrointestinal side-effects such as
 constipation, nausea, vomiting, black stools, and epigastric
 discomfort. 8,9 WHO subsequently recommended inter-​
 mittent supplementation if daily iron caused side-
 effects. 10,11 Concerns have also been reported that iron
 supplementation can predispose to haemoconcentration
 and gestational diabetes. 12 In low-income settings, an
 additional possibility is that iron supplementation
 might increase gastrointestinal and other infections,
 particularly malaria. Anaemia and low iron status are
 associated with protection against falciparum malaria in
 pregnant women, 13,14 and there are clear pathways by
 which iron administration abrogates this protection.
 Thus, lowering the dose of supplemental iron could be
 beneficial if it could be achieved without compromising
 efficacy.
 
<section> See 
<section> Online for appendix We reasoned that hepcidin, the hepatic iron-
 regulatory peptide that acts as a master regulator of
 standard-of-care 60 mg per day regimen. We calculated a
 threshold for the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin that would
 indicate whether a participant was ready-and-safe to receive
 iron. Our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to
 assess hepcidin-guided antenatal iron supplementation.
 The weekly screen-and-treat approach was non-inferior to the
 standard-of-care regimen. No evidence was found that the
 screen-and-treat approach was safer with respect to adverse
 events or ex-vivo tests of Plasmodium falciparum growth in
 red blood cells or sentinel bacterial growth in plasma.
 
<section> Implications of all the available evidence
 We were unable to show any clear advantages of a
 hepcidin-guided screen-and-treat approach to maternal iron
 supplementation over current WHO recommendations.
 These data and other available evidence suggest that efforts
 should be directed towards developing low-cost iron
 supplements with better side-effect profiles to help overcome
 poor adherence that currently undermines antenatal
 iron-supplementation programmes.
 
<section> iron metabolism, could signal when women are
 ready-and-safe to receive iron and, hence, could form
 the basis of a screen-and-treat iron and folic acid
 supplementation regimen. Hepcidin is the homoeo­
 static regulator of body iron absorption, distribution,
 and metabolism. 16 Circulating hepcidin is suppressed
 during iron deficiency, anaemia, and increased erythro­
 poiesis, and amounts of hepcidin are increased by high
 levels of iron in serum and the liver and during
 infection and inflammation. 17 By integrating these
 competing signals, a low amount of hepcidin indicates
 when the body is iron-deficient 18,19 and will efficiently
 absorb iron. 20 Conversely, raised amounts of hepcidin
 would block duodenal iron absorption thereby ren­
 dering supplementation ineffective and exposing the
 gut microbiota to unnecessary iron that could cause
 dysbiosis and side-effects.
 We postulated that a hepcidin-guided screen-and-
 treat approach to iron supplementation would be
 non-inferior to WHO’s recommended universal daily
 supplemen­ tation. Moreover, by lowering the total
 exposure to iron, we thought that this screen-and-treat
 approach might lead to better adherence and an
 improved side-effect and safety profile. Therefore, we
 designed the Hepcidin and Anaemia in Pregnancy
 (HAPn) study, a 12-week ran­ domised, double-blind,
 non-inferiority trial in pregnant women from The
 Gambia, to assess these ideas.

 Per-protocol analysis of change in haemoglobin from day 0 to day 84. Values are
 mean difference (95% CI). Dotted line shows the preset non-inferiority
 margin of –5 g/L.
 Participants’ characteristics at enrolment were similar
 between study groups (appendix pp 8–11) and indicated a
 population with high prevalence of anaemia (>50%).
 A third of all women were iron-deficient using ferritin
 thresholds adjusted for inflammation. Poor iron status
 in the study population was confirmed by the high
 prevalence of other iron markers with abnormal values.
 About a third of participants had inflammation, as
 measured by C-reactive protein and α -acid glycoprotein.
 Sickle-cell disorder was absent. Only one participant had
 a positive test for P falciparum infection.
 In the per-protocol analysis, the difference in haemo-​
 globin at day 84 did not exceed the preset non-inferiority
 margin of –5 g/L in the two screen-and-treat groups when
 compared with the reference group (table 1; figure 2).
 Moreover, the 30 mg screen-and-treat approach did not
 differ substantively from the 60 mg screen-and-treat
 approach (figure 2). Findings were similar in the modified
 intention-to-treat analysis (vs the reference group [n=166],
 –1·3 g/L, 95% CI –3·5 to 1·0 with the 60 mg screen-
 and-treat approach [n=164], and –2·9 g/L, –5·1 to –0·7 with
 the 30 mg screen-and-treat approach [n=165]).
 Compared with the reference group, hepcidin, ferritin,
 and the ferritin index (measures of iron deficiency)
 were all significantly lower at day 84 in both screen-and-
 treat groups (table 1). Values for other iron markers
 (eg, serum iron, transferrin, soluble transferrin receptor,
 and unbound iron binding capacity) confirmed these
 results (appendix pp 12–16). The prevalence of anaemia
 and iron deficiency showed a similar picture, although
 the contrasts between groups were more striking
 (table 2). In the reference group, the prevalence of
 anaemia dropped from 58% at day 0 to 45% at day 84 but
 rose in the two screen-and-treat groups, from 52% at
 day 0 to 57% at day 84 with the 60 mg screen-and-treat
 approach, and from 53% at day 0 to 59% at day
 with the 30 mg screen-and-treat approach, such that
 the two screen-and-treat approaches were clearly
 inferior to WHO’s recommended regimen. The preva­
 lence of being ready-and-safe to receive iron declined
 substantially in the reference group, from 56% at
 day 0 to 21% at day 84, which was a lower prevalence at
 day 84 than in both screen-and-treat groups (42% in the

 ferrous fumarate override the physiological mechanism
 of hepcidin-induced iron blockade evolved to regulate
 duodenal iron absorption from foods and, hence, iron
 continued to be absorbed in the reference group even in
 the face of raised hepcidin.
 Our study had several strengths and some weaknesses.
 Hepcidin is theoretically the ideal index of ready-and-safe
 to receive iron and it very effectively reduced the amount
 of iron administered in an area with high anaemia
 prevalence. The study had adequate statistical precision
 for the main outcomes, was done to Good Clinical
 Practice standards, and had high adherence and relatively
 few dropouts. One limitation is that the sample size was
 insufficient to capture potentially rare adverse events,
 and another is that the trial was conducted in an area
 with low malaria transmission, high use of insecticide-
 treated bed nets, and intermittent preventive treatment
 for pregnant women and, hence, could not assess to what
 extent the screen-and-treat approach reduced the risk of
 malaria. Our proxy safety outcomes for malarial and
 bacterial infections provide intuitively solid outcomes
 but might not reflect in-vivo susceptibility. Provision of
 iron with multiple other micronutrients can be viewed as
 both a strength and a weakness: a strength because
 other nutrient deficiencies that might limit the
 acquisition or utilisation of iron should be eradicated,
 and a weakness because of possible nutrient–nutrient
 interactions (eg, zinc in UNIMMAP might compete with
 iron for absorption). Note also that UNIMMAP capsules
 are not enteric-coated, which will not affect aggregate
 iron availability but may cause loss of other micro-​
 nutrients. Because all participants received the same
 UNIMMAP, except for differences in iron content, this
 concern would not affect comparison between study
 groups.
 Previous evidence shows that intermittent iron supple­
 mentation in pregnancy is somewhat less efficacious
 than daily supplementation, 4,11 and we conclude from this
 study that a hepcidin-guided screen-and-treat strategy
 does not overcome this limitation. Our results are likely
 to be generalisable at least to other populations in LMICs
 with high prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency and
 in a low malaria setting. Future alternatives to universal
 oral iron supplementation in pregnancy might include
 use of parenteral iron formulations such as ferric
 carboxymaltose, which can deliver up to 1000 mg
 elemental iron over a 15-min infusion. This approach
 will need evidence of cost-effectiveness and safety in
 low-income settings, together with development of
 infrastructure, to overcome barriers to implementation.
 Therefore, we support continued application of the
 current WHO guidelines but urge development of novel
 iron formulations with much better side-effect profiles to
 encourage improved adherence. The findings of our
 malaria susceptibility assays underscore the importance
 of the WHO guide­ line that iron administration in
 malarious areas should ideally be implemented in
 conjunction with adequate measures to prevent,
 diagnose, and treat malaria.
