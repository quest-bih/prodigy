<section> Abstract
 
<section> Background
 
<section> Malnutrition due to inadequate dietary intake is commonly reported in children with Cerebral
 palsy (CP). Poor dietary intakes are majorly caused by feeding dysfunctions secondary to
 oro-motor impairment characteristic of the condition. Strategies that improve nutrient densi-
 ties in foods can help enhance nutrient intakes by these children.
 
<section> Objective
 
<section> This study investigated the effect of consumption of fermented finger millet porridge fortified
 with Moringa oleifera leaf powder (MoLP) on the protein and vitamin A status of children with
 CP.
 
<section> Design
 
<section> A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 113 children aged 5–11 years with CP.
 The study had two arms (intervention [N = 57] and control [N = 56]). The intervention group
 received a daily serving of fortified finger millet porridge for 3 months while the control group
 received non-fortified finger millet porridge servings. All children received the same amounts
 of porridge servings. The levels of serum albumin and retinol between the groups were com-
 pared at both baseline and end line. The BMI-for-age Z-scores (BMIAZ) and morbidity prev-
 alence of the children were also assessed.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> At baseline, the two study groups were similar in all demographic and socio-economic char-
 acteristics, nutrient intakes, serum levels of albumin and retinol, weight status and morbidity.
 At end line, the children from the intervention group had significantly higher intakes of vita-
 min A at 717.12±432.7 μg/d (p = 0.038) and protein at 44.367±17.2 g/d (p = 0.031) respec-
 tively. The serum nutrients levels increased significantly from baseline by 0.456±0.12 g/dL

<section> (p<0.001) for albumin and by 0.243±0.10 μmol/L (p<0.001) for retinol among children in the
 intervention group. Among the children in the control group, the changes in the levels of
 both serum albumin 0.012±0.07 g/dL (p = 0.868) and serum retinol [0.0021±0.02 μmol/L (p
 = 0.890)] were not significant. At endline, the BMI-for-age Z-scores results showed that
 10.52% and 34.0% of children from intervention and control group respectively were under-
 nourished [χ2 = 30.985; p = 0.037]. Among the children in the intervention, group there was
 a significant change in the weight status between baseline and endline (p = 0.036). The
 weight status among children in the control group was not significantly different between
 baseline and endline (p = 0.109). Significant difference in morbidity prevalence between the
 two groups was also observed at endline (p = 0.003) with the prevalence being 24.6% and
 51.8% among children in the intervention and control group respectively.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> Consumption of M. oleifera fortified porridge significantly improved the children’s serum
 albumin and retinol levels, as well as BMIAZ.

<section> Introduction
 
<section> Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neurologic disorders typically caused by a non-progressive
 lesion or abnormality of the developing brain that appears in infancy or early childhood and
 permanently affects body movement, muscle coordination, and balance [1]. It is the most com-
 mon cause of physical disability in childhood and constitutes a significant health problem with
 major effects throughout the lifespan [1–4]. The global incidence of CP is approximately 2 to
 2.5/1000 live births, with prevalence varying widely from country to country [5,6]. Despite
 concerns of underreporting, this prevalence has been suggested to be even higher in develop-
 ing countries throughout Africa [7] and is estimated at up to 10 cases per 1000 births[5,8].
 Higher prevalence in Africa is likely due to the level of perinatal complications such as birth
 asphyxia and neonatal infections [5]. There is limited data on the current prevalence rate of
 
<section> CP in Kenya.
 A number of studies have reported increased prevalence of morbidity and mortality sec-
 ondary to compromised nutritional status among children with CP compared to their normal
 counterparts in the same age group [3,9–11]. According to the UNICEF conceptual framework
 on the determinants of malnutrition [12], dietary intake is one of the immediate determinants
 of nutritional status. Children with CP commonly suffer nutrient deficiencies as a result of
 compromised dietary intakes due to feeding dysfunctions such as oropharyngeal dysphagia
 associated with the condition [13]. Strategies to enhance nutrient densities of foods consumed
 by children with CP are thus critical to ensuring that they meet their requirements of essential
 nutrients for optimal growth and health [10,14,15]. Among the common nutritional concerns
 in children with CP are Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM) and vitamin A deficiencies
 (VAD) [16,17].
 The potential of M. oleifera for use as a fortificant in different food formulations including
 soups and complementary foods has become a subject of research interest due to its high 
<section> nutritional value which is widely acknowledged in literature [18–20]. Improvements in protein
 malnutrition, VAD and calcium and iron deficiencies in children have been reported after
 interventions with M. oleifera [21]. In a related publication, the authors have reported the
 potential of the M. oleifera fortificant to improve the protein and vitamin A content of fer-
 mented finger millet porridge [22].
 The Food and Agricultural Organization is currently promoting the use of indigenous and/
 or underutilized crops readily found in various localities as an economically sustainable strat-
 egy to enhancing food security and addressing common deficiencies in local populations
 [23,24]. There is, however, a scarcity of studies addressing the nutritional viability of local/
 indigenous crops to treat malnutrition in disease contexts particularly in neurological disor-
 ders such a cerebral palsy. The lack of rigorous and systematic tests of the nutritional efficacy
 of local food fortificants to mitigate malnutrition in disease context, constituted a gap this
 study aimed to address. The study was undertaken to investigate the effect of consumption of
 
<section> M oleifera fortified porridge on protein and vitamin A status in children with cerebral palsy.
 
<section> Methods
 
<section> Study site
 
<section> The study was conducted at Little Rock Day Care Centre located in Kibra informal settlement
 in Nairobi County from May to July 2018. The Little Rock Day Care Centre center serves as
 rehabilitation center for children with special needs. Kibra is one of the most densely popu-
 lated informal settlements in Kenya and with the highest poverty rates with over 70% of the
 population living below the poverty line. Sanitation and hygiene conditions are very poor and
 physical infrastructure including housing and road access are at their poorest condition.
 
<section> Study design
 
<section> This was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the effect of the consumption of
 Moringa oleifera-fortified finger millet porridge on protein and vitamin A status of children
 with cerebral palsy in Nairobi Kenya. The study comprised of two study arms: the control
 group (receiving fermented finger millet porridge) and the intervention group (receiving fer-
 mented finger millet porridge fortified with M. oleifera leaf powder). The study was approved
 by the Kenyatta University Ethical Review Committee (KUERC), Ref. No. KU/ERC/
 APPROVAL/VOL.1 (83). Written informed consents were obtained from caregivers of the
 children who were the respondents.
 The trial whose results are being published was registered retrospectively. This was mainly
 because of limited prior knowledge on trial registration. This however, did not in any way
 influence the reporting of the findings and the research methodologies. The authors confirm
 that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.
 
<section> Sample size determination
 
<section> The study adopted the formula by Noordzij [25] for sample size calculation in RCT studies.
 Calculation of the sample size was based on the main primary outcome (serum albumin lev-
 els); 80% power of the test and a 5% level of significance (α = 0.05) according to the recom-
 mendations by Cohen, [26] and Noordzij et al., [26]. Both the population means and variance
 were derived from the results of the pilot study conducted for this study. The calculated sample
 size was 52 participants (caregiver-child pairs) per group. This sample size was inflated by 10%
 to cater for attrition, hence the final sample size was; 52+5 = 57 participants per group totaling
 
<section> = 114 caregiver-child pairs for the two study groups. 
<section> Randomization
 
<section> Upon recruitment, the children were randomly allocated on a 1:1 ratio to the two study groups
 (control and intervention) by the researchers. Randomization was conducted by an indepen-
 dent biostatistician using a computerized random number function in Microsoft Office Excel
 2008. The numbers generated were printed on a piece of paper, uniformly folded, and the care-
 givers were asked to pick one. The children were placed into the groups depending on the num-
 ber which the caregiver picked and which had been allocated to by the randomization process.
 
<section> Recruitment process and trial profile of the study subjects. A total of 114 children were
 recruited and randomized into the study. All those from the intervention group completed the
 full course of treatment and follow-up for the three-month duration of the study (May-July
 2018). One child from the control group was lost to follow up because of complications devel-
 oped during the study though not related to the study treatment (Fig 1). Both the experimental
 porridge (Moringa oleifera fortified fermented finger porridge) and the control porridge (non-
 fortified fermented finger millet porridge) were well tolerated. No adverse reactions attribut-
 able to the products occurred during the study period.
 
<section> Study participants and screening
 
<section> The study targeted children ages 5–11 years diagnosed with cerebral palsy by a medical doctor,
 attending Little Rock Daycare Center in Kibra Informal settlements and their caregivers. Chil-
 dren with cerebral palsy who had chronic ailments that would independently affect food intake
 such as; cardiovascular diseases, cancer, renal dysfunction, and liver problems were excluded.
 The children who met the inclusion criteria and whose caregivers were willing to participate
 the study by giving their informed consent, were randomly assigned to the intervention or
 control groups by the researchers.
 
<section> Selection and training of research assistants
 
<section> Selection and training of the cooks. Two cooks with diploma level of education in food
 and beverage service were recruited and trained on the standard recipe of the porridge and the
 serving portions. They were trained on their roles in preparing the porridge and weighing out
 the servings as well as weighing and recording the left-over portions from each of the study
 participants- the children. The cooks worked closely with the data collectors.
 
<section> Selection and training of data collectors. Four data collectors with a minimum of diploma
 in Food, Nutrition and Dietetics were recruited into the research team. Prior experience in surveys
 was an added advantage. The data collectors were trained for a period of 2 days by the principal
 researcher on: their roles and expectations; research ethics; recruitment of the study participants;
 how to administer the data collections tools and the entire data collection procedures.
 
<section> Blinding design
 
<section> The biostatistician, the cooks and the data collectors, study participants, caregivers and the
 workforce at the children’s centre were all blinded to the study hypotheses. It was only the
 researchers who were aware of the study hypotheses. The cooks were instructed not to disclose
 the recipe of the coded porridge samples fed to the children to any one including the data col-
 lectors and the participants.
 
<section> Description of interventions
 
<section> Control group (CG). Children in the control group received porridge prepared from fer-
 mented finger millet flour. The porridge was prepared at the daycare center by the caterer and 
<section> Fig 1. Trial profile of the study participants.
 
<section> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0001206.g001
 
<section> cooks, following a standard procedure, explained in a related publication [22], and fed to the
 children by data collectors, both under the supervision of the researchers. Each child received
 a daily portion of porridge equivalent to 250ml in a cup at 10 am, five days a week, for three 
<section> months. The left-over porridge by the children was measured and the amount of porridge con-
 sumed by each child determined daily for the entire study period (Fig 2).
 
<section> Intervention group. Children in the intervention group received porridge prepared from fer-
 mented finger millet flour fortified with 10% M. oleifera leaf powder. As presented in a related
 publication, 10% fortification rate was found to significantly improve the vitamin A and protein
 content of the porridge without significantly compromising its sensory acceptability, that is col-
 our, texture, taste and overall acceptability [22]. The same procedure used for control group was
 followed in the preparation and administration of the fortified porridge for the children in the
 intervention group. (Fig 2). Pictures of samples of the prepared porridges is presented in S1 Fig.
 
<section> Study outcomes
 
<section> The primary study outcomes in this trial were the improved protein and vitamin A status of
 the children. Protein status was determined by the levels of serum albumin which is the most
 abundant protein in the blood and also the major carrier of free fatty acids in the blood,
 whereas vitamin A status was indicated by serum retinol levels. The secondary outcomes were
 changes in weight status measured by BMI-for-Age Z-scores (BMIAZ) and morbidity status
 assessed by the prevalence of illness based on a 2-week recall.
 
<section> Data collection tools
 
<section> The study questionnaires were developed and face-validated through multiple pre-tests, and
 finally pilot- tested and refined for clarity and accuracy. Two questionnaires were used to col-
 lect data; a baseline questionnaire and a questionnaire used at the end of the study (at three
 months). The questionnaires solicited information on the 24-hour dietary recall, anthropome-
 try (weight and height measurements), morbidity prevalence based on a 24-hour recall. The
 questionnaire had a biochemical test schedule to record levels of serum albumin and serum
 retinol. In addition, the baseline questionnaire solicited information on the socio-demo-
 graphic and economic status of the study participants.
 
<section> Pilot study
 
<section> A pilot study was conducted on a sample of 14 caregiver-child pairs (about 11% of the sample size
 for the main study sample) from a Centre in Nairobi comparable to the study site. Piloting was con-
 ducted to validate and standardize the study procedures and research instruments. The pilot study
 also accorded the research assistants the opportunity to practically apply the skills learnt during the
 training, and experience the possible challenges that would be faced during the main study. The feed-
 back was used to make appropriate and necessary changes in the study procedure and data collection
 tools before commencement of the study. The findings of the pilot study are presented in S2 Table.
 
<section> Collection of data at baseline and end line
 
<section> Except for the data on the demographic and economic characteristics of the study respondents
 which was collected at only baseline, the rest of the data was collected at both baseline and end-
 line. Information on the demographic and socio-economic profile of the study subjects was
 collected at baseline to establish homogeneity or differences in the two study groups that could
 have a bearing on the study outcome variables.
 Data was collected using the same methods on the following variables at both baseline and
 endline.
 
<section> Collection of blood samples for determination of protein and vitamin A status of the
 
<section> children. A certified phlebotomist collected 5.0 mL of venous blood by venipuncture of a

<section> peripheral vein using disposable syringes. The specimens were collected in trace-element-free
 tubes, immediately wrapped in aluminum foil, to shield them from light, then put in portable
 freezers for transportation to the laboratory for biochemical analysis where they were stored
 
<section> 4˚C until centrifugation.
 
<section> Anthropometry measurements. Anthropometric measures were taken using standard-
 ized protocols [27]. Weight was measured in kilograms using a zero-calibrated digital weigh-
 ing scale (Seca Robust 813) and recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg, following standard guidelines
 (i.e., removing extra clothing, standing still). Alternatively, for children not able to stand alone,
 the weight was calculated as the difference between the caregiver’s weight with and without
 child. Standing Height was measured using a stadiometer (Seca 217) and recorded to the near-
 est 0.1 cm. For children with deformities, the knee height (the height from the knee to the
 heel) was taken and used to estimate the overall height using the equation � height =
 
<section> (2.69 × knee height) + 24.2 [28]. Knee height was recorded for all children to the nearest milli-
 meter. Following World Health Organization (WHO) best-practice procedures, height, length,
 and knee height measurements were obtained twice by two independent observers: and the
 average taken as the final measurement if they agreed to within less than 5mm, or else both re-
 measured until agreement achieved [29].The BMI of the children enrolled in the study was cal-
 culated from weight and height measurements as weight (in kg)/height 2 (in m) and BMIAZ
 determined using WHO 2006 BMI-for-age reference tables for children and adolescents (5–19
 years). Z-scores were then used to categorize the children according to their weight status.
 
<section> Dietary intakes
 
<section> Non-consecutive two-day 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted to determine the nutrient intake
 per day and hence the adequacy of the nutrients. The two recalls were conducted within a two-week
 interval with one being conducted on a weekday and the other on a weekend to minimize random
 error and to capture the variation between weekdays and weekend days. The 24-hour recall was
 undertaken by trained research assistants using a standard protocol. The data collected included a
 description of the foods eaten; the cooking methods; brand names (e.g., for cereals, processed
 snacks); and the quantity of food consumed which was estimated using the common household
 measures. Each food item consumed was linked to the equivalent food in the Kenya Food Composi-
 tion Tables for determination of nutrient content per unit (100g) and consequent calculation of
 nutrient intakes. The average nutrient intakes were calculated from the two recalls. The multiple
 pass approach consisting of five steps was adopted in conducting the 24-hour dietary recall inter-
 views since it yields the most accurate data and best recall [30]. The steps included (1) Quick list, to
 collect a list of foods and beverages consumed during the previous day (i.e., over past 24 hours) (2)
 Forgotten foods, to probe for foods forgotten during the quick list (3) Time and occasion, to record
 time and eating occasion for each food (4) Detail cycle, to record detailed description, amount, use
 of condiments, cooking methods, brands of foods if purchased, and other information as review of
 24-hour day and (5) Final probe, to probe anything else consumed.
 
<section> Morbidity
 
<section> Morbidity data were collected, based on a 2-week recall period to determine the prevalence (if
 a child had suffered illness), frequency (number of times a child fell ill), and types of illnesses
 reported.
 
<section> Data analysis
 
<section> Biochemical analysis for nutrient intake. Retinol was extracted from serum with ethanol
 containing butylated-hydroxytoluene (BHT). Retinol was determined by HPLC (Thermo 
<section> Scientific Accella LC system; Thermo Fisher Scientific) with spectrofluorimetric detection
 (λex 340 nm; λcm 460 nm), but serum albumin was quantified using bromocresol green
 (BCG) ASSAY method. The absorbances (Abs) of standards and the samples was read in a
 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Beckman DU-650, Fullerton) at 545 nm against the blank and
 albumin concentration in the samples was determined according to the general formula:
 Albumin (g/dl) = (Abs sample/ Abs standard) X Concentration of standard.
 
<section> Anthropometric data analysis
 
<section> WHO Child Growth Standards (2006) [31] were used to interpret the nutritional status of the
 children because this is what is currently used in Kenya: Cut-offs for BMIAZ were set at
 
<section> �-2SD for wasting/thinness, >+1 for overweight and >+3 for obesity.
 
<section> Dietary intake data analysis
 
<section> The 24-hour recall data was entered into the Nutri-survey software for processing using the
 Kenya Food Composition Table as the reference for nutrient composition. In instances where
 a food item could not be found in the Kenya Food Composition Table, it was added to the
 database using food manufacturing websites and other Food Composition Tables. Nutrient
 data obtained from the analysis were compared with the Recommended Daily Allowances by
 UNICEF/WHO (2002) to determine the adequacy of nutrient intakes.
 Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) ver-
 sion 19.0 software. All statistical tests were two-tailed with an alpha value of 0.05. Summary
 statistics (means, percentages and SDs) were used to describe all variables of interest. Data
 were tested for normality to decide between parametric and non-parametric tests. Parametric
 tests including t-test, and Pearson product-moment correlation were used to analyze normally
 distributed data while non-parametric alternatives such McNemar-s test were used for non-
 normally distributed data. The chi-square test, Marginal homogeneity test, and McNemar’s
 test were used to test differences in the two study groups for categorical variables such as edu-
 cation, marital status, occupation and BMIAZ. Independent t-test was used to test for differ-
 ences between the intervention and the control groups for continuous variables such as age,
 nutrient intakes, serum levels of albumin and retinol. The paired t-test was used to compare
 differences in continuous variables (nutrient intake, serum albumin and retinol levels)
 between baseline and end line for each study group and to determine the magnitude of change
 in nutrient intakes and serum levels. The wealth index was computed by means principal com-
 ponent analysis (PCA) using data on household asset ownership (Fig 3). Included in the analy-
 sis were key items including land, car, motorcycle, mobile phone and bank account
 ownership. The PCA revealed two components that explained 63.64% of variance. Component
 one eigenvalue = 1.42 (variance explained = 35.59%), component two eigenvalue = 1.12(vari-
 ance explained = 28.05%). All the measures loaded onto one of the two components. Compo-
 nent one was made of bank account, bicycle and car. The second factor was made of land, and
 bank account. Component one was thus taken as the wealth index. The wealth index was
 recoded into a categorical variable by dividing the household into 5 groups.
 
<section> Results
 
<section> Comparison of study groups at baseline
 
<section> Socio-demographic and economic baseline characteristics by study groups. No differ-
 ences were found in socio-demographic and economic characteristics of the participants of
 two study groups at baseline, an indication that randomization was successful (Table 1).

<section> the study groups.
 
<section> Dietary intakes by study groups at baseline. The mean daily intakes by the intervention
 and control groups were 30.68±14.77g and 30.50±16.93g respectively for proteins and 456.12
 ±374.14μg and 477.45±373.5μg respectively for vitamin A. There were no significant differ-
 ences in the intakes of nutrients between the study groups at baseline (Table 2).
 
<section> Levels of serum albumin and serum retinol at baseline by study groups. The baseline
 serum albumin levels were 3.067±1.09 and 3.186±1.16 g/dL for the intervention and control
 group respectively (Table 3). There was no significant difference in baseline serum albumin
 levels between control and intervention group children (t = -1.088; p = 0.280). The serum reti-
 nol levels at baseline were at 0.471± 0.05 and 0.468 ± 0.02 μmol/L in the intervention and con-
 trol group respectively. There was no significant difference in baseline serum retinol levels
 between the children in the control and intervention group (t = -0.042; p < 0.966) (Table 3).
 
<section> Weight status of the study participants at baseline by study groups. The BMI of the
 study participants were calculated from anthropometric measurements and BMI-for-age Z-
 scores determined using WHO 2006 BMI-for-age Reference for Children and Adolescents (5–
 19 years). The Z-scores were then used to categorize the children according to their weight sta-
 tus (Table 4). At baseline, 38.6% and 33.9% of children from intervention and control groups
 respectively were underweight whereas 52.6% and 55.4% of children from intervention and
 control groups respectively were in the normal weight range (between �-2SD and +1SD). A
 small proportion of the study children, i.e. 5.3% and 7.1% of children from intervention and
 control groups respectively, were overweight while 5.5% and 3.6% of children from the inter-
 vention and control groups respectively, were obese. No significant differences existed in the
 weight status between the two study groups (t-test, p = 0.856) at baseline.

<section> The average intake of porridge by the study groups during the intervention phase. On
 
<section> average, 248.07±3.81 ml and 248.46±2.33 ml of the porridge servings were consumed daily by
 
<section> each child in the intervention and control group respectively, throughout the period of inter-
 
<section> vention. No significant differences were recorded in the daily average consumption in the por-
 
<section> ridge servings between the study groups (t [118] = -0.682; p = 0.497). Furthermore, the

<section> The serum levels of albumin and retinol for each of the two study groups were compared
 between baseline and endline and the magnitude of change was computed (Table 9). The
 results showed that in the intervention group, serum albumin levels significantly increased by
 0.456±0.12 g/dL [t (56) = -3.890; p <0.001] while serum retinol levels significantly increased
 by 0.243±0.10 μmol/L [t (56) = -6.747; p <0.001. On the other hand, among children in the
 control group, the levels of serum albumin and retinol only increased marginally by 0.012
 
<section> ±0.07 g/dL [t (55) = -0.167; p = 0.868] and 0.0021±0.02 μmol/L [t (55) = -0.139; p = 0.890]
 respectively (Table 9).
 The differences in the magnitude of change in the serum (albumin and retinol between the
 control and intervention groups were further determined by computing the difference in dif-
 ference (DiD). The results showed significant differences in the magnitude of change in the
 levels of serum albumin and serum retinol between the two study groups with the greater mag-
 nitudes of change being realized among the intervention group (Table 10).
 
<section> Effect of the consumption of M. oleifera fortified porridge on the weight status of the
 study children at endline. The rates of undernutrition among the intervention and control
 group children were 10.52% and 34% respectively while 71.9% and 57.1% of children from
 intervention and control groups respectively, were in the normal weight range. Furthermore,
 the weight distribution among the children in the two study groups was significantly different
 at endline [χ2 = 30.985; p = 0.037] (Table 11).
 
<section> Effect of the consumption of M. oleifera fortified porridge on morbidity prevalence of

 rheal morbidity (p = 0.044), coughs and cold (p = 0.041), epileptic fits (p = 0.025), and fre-
 quency of illness (p = 0.012) between the two study groups. The children in the intervention
 group had significantly reduced morbidity compared to the control group (Table 12).

<section> Discussion
 
<section> This Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial (RCT) study was undertaken to investigate the
 effect of the consumption of M. oleifera fortified porridge on protein and vitamin A status in
 children with cerebral palsy. Randomization was successfully conducted because the interven-
 tion and control groups were similar in their baseline characteristics.
 
<section> Nutrient intakes of the study children at baseline
 
<section> The intakes of proteins and vitamin A between the two study groups showed no significant dif-
 ferences at baseline. At endline significant differences were observed. A Ugandan study [32] 
<section> reported that the average daily nutrient intake from other foods excluding the treatments
 (unfortified finger millet porridge and finger millet porridge fortified with 7% M. oleifera leaf
 powder or 17% C maxima flesh) consumed by children did not indicate a significant difference
 within the groups as the sampled children had been drawn from similar socio-economic char-
 acteristics. In the current study, the significant differences observed between the groups at
 endline concerning the serum albumin and retinol levels as well as BMI-for-age Z-scores can
 therefore be attributed to the differences in the nutrient content of the porridge given to each
 of the groups as opposed to the portion size consumed. The Ugandan study also observed that
 children fed on traditional millet porridges had challenges in meeting their vitamin A require-
 ment. Feeding of nutrient-enriched foods to children with cerebral palsy is therefore impor-
 tant in order to make up for the usually poor food intake, and feeding challenges which are
 characteristic to these children. Maximizing the dietary intake of specific nutrients such as
 vitamin A and protein is therefore critical to health.
 
<section> Effect of M. oleifera fortified porridge consumption on the levels of serum
 albumin and serum retinol of the study children
 
<section> This study was designed to test the effect of the consumption of M. oleifera fortified porridge
 on protein and vitamin A status of children with cerebral palsy. The results showed that the
 consumption of M oleifera-fortified porridge improved the levels of both serum albumin and
 serum retinol of the study children. At baseline serum albumin levels of both the study groups
 were below the normal range (3.5–5.0 g/dL) which indicated protein deficiency, secondary to
 poor dietary intakes or presence of infections [33,34]. At endline the serum albumin levels
 among the children in the intervention group were in the normal range albeit toward the
 lower limit (3.52 g/dL) representing a significant but modest improvement. The serum albu-
 min levels among the children in the control group did not improve significantly at endline.
 The baseline serum retinol levels for both study groups were below the cutoff values
 
<section> (0.7 μmol/L). At endline, the serum retinol levels among the children in the intervention
 group increased significantly to a value of 0.714 μmol/L, which was slightly above the cut-off
 for RDA while that of the children in control group experienced no significant change. Low
 serum retinol levels (below RDA cutoff values) represent vitamin A deficiency, which could
 due to low dietary intake arising from feeding difficulties. Vitamin A deficiency has implica-
 tions in reduced immunity and increased susceptibility to infections [35]. The significant
 increase in serum albumin and retinol to levels above the cutoff values, observed at the endline
 among the intervention group as compared to the control study group implies the efficacy of
 the M. oleifera fortified flour in raising/improving the serum levels thus enhancing the nutri-
 tional status of the child.
 However, the findings of the current study, deviate from those of a Ghanaian study con-
 ducted by Boateng et al., [36] on improving blood retinol concentrations with complementary
 foods fortified with M. oleifera leaf powder. In the Ghanaian study, only marginal, insignificant
 rise in serum levels of vitamin A after 6-week supplementation with Moringa was observed.
 May be the 6-week intervention may have been too short to the demonstration of the effect of
 the treatment. Another study conducted in Burkina Faso reported that after 12 months of
 intervention with Moringa oleifera leaf powder, the proportion of children with low serum ret-
 inol concentration decreased significantly in both control and treatment study groups. How-
 ever, there was no significant difference between the groups at endline thus attributing their
 improvement in serum retinol status to other factors other than the intervention [37]. Our
 study eliminated known confounding factors by random placement of the study participants
 in the study groups (Randomized Clinical Trial) unlike in the Burkina Faso study. 
<section> Furthermore, the randomization process in this study was successful in that the study groups
 were similar in their baseline characteristics. This implies that the significant differences
 observed between the groups at the endline with respect to the serum albumin and serum reti-
 nol levels can be attributed to the intervention. In a related publication, the authors have
 reported the improved nutrient content of a Moringa-fortified fermented finger millet porridge
 and its potential for mitigating malnutrition among nutritionally vulnerable populations [22].
 
<section> Effect of M. oleifera fortified porridge consumption on the weight status
 
<section> for the study children
 
<section> BMI-for-age Z scores of the children in the two study groups were significantly different at
 endline (p = 0.037). The percentage of underweight children in the intervention study group
 decreased from 38.6% to 10.5% while that in control group only decreased from 33.9% to
 30.4%. The percentage of overweight children decreased from 10.7% to 5.4% among the con-
 trol children and from 8.8% to 5.3% among intervention group children. Overall, the weight
 status of children in the intervention group changed significantly (p<0.001) as opposed to that
 of the control group which did not change significantly (p = 0.109). The improvement
 observed in the weight status of children in the intervention study group was attributable to
 the consumption of the Moringa-fortified porridge by the children. The findings of the current
 study show the efficacy of Moringa-fortified finger millet porridge in improving the BMI–for-
 age Z scores of children with cerebral palsy.
 
<section> Effect of M. oleifera fortified porridge consumption on the prevalence of
 morbidity among the study children
 
<section> Significant differences in the morbidity status between the groups were observed at endline
 with the children in the intervention groups showing significant improvement in morbidity
 status as opposed to the control group that showed no significant change. This improvement
 in morbidity among the intervention group is most likely attributable to the intervention since
 the two groups were similar in their morbidity patterns at baseline. A recent study conducted
 in Uganda reported that children fed on fermented Moringa-millet porridges had significantly
 fewer incidences of diarrhea (p = 0.006) and respiratory infections (p = 0.003) compared to
 children fed on traditional millet porridges. In the Uganda study, however, the Records from
 Voluntary Health Trainers showed that the health-seeking habits of all groups were not signifi-
 cantly different [32]. The findings of the current research consolidate the association between
 dietary intakes, disease, and nutrition status as established in the literature [12,38,39].
 
<section> Strengths of the study
 
<section> Pilot-testing of the study which ensured the validity of the study and the reliability of data. Suc-
 cessful randomization ensured that the differences in the study outcomes at endline were
 majorly attributable to the intervention. The study tested the vitamin A and protein content
 the two flours prior to utilization for making the porridges. The study made use of an easily
 prepared food fortificant (Moringa oleifera leaves) on available and commonly consumed food
 item (porridge made from millet flour). It also used a commonly available under-utilized food
 product i.e Moringa oleifera.
 
<section> Limitations of the study
 
<section> Fortification level was at 10%. A higher ratio would otherwise have a significant effect on sen-
 sory acceptability of the porridge. To improve the fortificant level, further investigations are 
<section> necessary on strategies that would not interfere with the sensory characteristics of the
 porridge.
 
<section> Conclusion
 
<section> We conclude that the consumption of M. oleifera fortified finger millet porridge was effective
 in improving the serum albumin and retinol status of the children with cerebral palsy as well
 as their weight status. This study recommends the promotion of Moringa oleifera leaf powder
 as a suitable fortificant for home prepared foods, such as porridge for children with this condi-
 tion to improve their dietary intake of protein and vitamin A.
