<section> INTRODUCTION
 In 2016, an estimated 19.4 million people
 were living with HIV in southern and eastern
 Africa. 1 Despite expansion of HIV testing
 and treatment programmes, one-­quarter of
 people living with HIV remained unaware of
 their HIV status. HIV testing gaps were highest
 in adolescents and men, including in Malawi.
 In 2015–2016, the proportion of undiagnosed
 HIV was 46% among HIV-­ positive adoles-
 cents and young adults aged 15–24 years, the
 highest across age groups. 2 Of men with HIV,
 28% were unaware of their status compared
 with 20% of women with HIV. 2 Reaching high
 coverage of HIV testing remains essential for

 Community-­ based HIV testing strategies can iden-
 tify HIV-­positive persons at earlier stages of infection
 and improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation
 and retention when provided with universal treat-
 ment services. 7 8 Provision of HIV self-­testing (HIVST)
 through community-­ based approaches can further
 extend coverage of HIV testing among underserved
 population subgroups. 9 In Malawi, urban community-­
 based distribution of HIVST kits achieved high uptake,
 with offer of home-­based HIV care further increasing
 demand for ART. 10 11 Introducing HIVST with door-­to-­
 door HIV testing services (HTS) by community health
 workers increased knowledge of HIV status among
 urban Zambians. 12 Community-­based HIVST is there-
 fore a promising approach for providing HIV testing,
 though lower literacy and healthcare access among
 rural populations could influence uptake of self-­care
 technologies. 13 Limited data were previously available
 on the effectiveness and safety of HIVST from rural,
 underserved populations in high HIV prevalence
 settings.
 In this study, we used a cluster randomised trial to eval-
 uate the effectiveness and safety of door-­to-­door distribu-
 tion of HIVST kits in rural Malawi. Specifically, we aimed
 to assess whether distribution of HIVST kits through
 community-­based distribution agents (CBDAs) increased
 the proportion of the population who tested for HIV
 and were initiated on ART at cluster level. Our study is
 part of a multicountry evaluation of community-­based
 distribution of HIVST kits under the Unitaid/Popula-
 tion Services International (PSI) HIV Self-­Testing Africa
 
<section> (STAR) Initiative.
 
<section> METHODS
 Design, setting and participants
 We conducted a parallel cluster randomised trial of
 door-­ to-­ door distribution of HIVST kits. 14 The study
 was based in 22 government primary health centres
 and their defined areas in four high HIV prevalence
 districts (Blantyre, Machinga, Mwanza, Neno). A cluster
 randomised design was adopted since the intervention
 was implemented at the health facility level. The study
 team enrolled health facilities providing HIV testing and
 ART services to rural communities in their catchment
 areas, with verbal consent obtained from facility repre-
 sentatives. Boundaries were drawn for: (1) the facility
 catchment area, and (2) the evaluation area within the
 facility catchment area. The intervention was delivered
 throughout the facility catchment area, while primary
 and secondary outcomes were measured among resi-
 dents from the evaluation area. Specifically, the study
 population included residents aged 16 years and older
 from the evaluation area.

<section> SOC arm
 
<section> Randomisation
 The 22 health facilities were randomised 1:1 to the HIVST
 intervention alongside the standard of care (SOC) or the
 SOC alone, which primarily consisted of facility-­based
 HTS (figure 1). A computer-­generated random sample
 was drawn by MN from 150 855 unique combinations of
 allocating health facilities to one of the two study arms,
 restricted by district, catchment population size, number
 of HTS clients and the proportion of clients testing HIV
 positive. 15 The final allocation was assigned at a public
 ceremony on 21 March 2016. Numbered balls were
 selected by community and government representatives
 from an opaque bag that corresponded to a unique alloca-
 tion. Blinding of the implementation team and residents
 was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention, but
 masking was maintained where possible, including data
 collection, management and analysis without reference
 to the study arms.
 A planned second randomisation of home-­based HIV
 care in the HIVST arm was not implemented due to
 delays in initiating the intervention, leaving an insuffi-
 cient interval for assessment.
 
<section> Procedures
 
<section> The HIVST intervention was delivered for at least
 months within the evaluation area of eligible health facili-
 ties before expanding to the rest of the facility catchment
 area. HIVST kits were distributed by existing CBDAs, who
 provided reproductive health products prior to HIVST
 distribution, and newly recruited CBDAs selected in
 consultation with village heads.
 PSI Malawi conducted 1-­week trainings based on an
 HIVST training curriculum developed in collaboration
 with the Ministry of Health. The training included basic
 information on HIV diagnosis and treatment; promoting 
<section> HIVST using social marketing; using kits and interpreting
 results; providing pretest and post-­test information and
 support, including referral for confirmatory HIV testing
 and ART following a positive self-­test; anticipating and
 managing social harms; storing kits; and collecting data.
 National HIV testing and counselling practices and prin-
 ciples on voluntariness, consent and protection of client
 privacy and confidentiality were also covered in the
 training.
 CBDAs then provided the OraQuick HIV Self-­ Test
 (OraSure Technologies, Thailand), along with locally
 adapted instructions for use, 16 an opaque envelope for
 disposal and a self-­referral card to facilitate linkage to
 routine HIV services at health facilities. In their respec-
 tive areas, CBDAs distributed HIVST kits door-­to-­door
 or on request to residents aged 16 years and older, with
 their sociodemographic characteristics recorded in regis-
 ters. Residents could self-­test with CBDAs or in private. If
 residents elected to self-­test privately, CBDAs followed up
 within 7 days of distribution to provide optional post-­test
 support. Disclosure was not required, and HIVST results
 were not recorded in registers. Residents were also asked
 to place their used kits in envelopes to be returned to
 CBDAs or deposited in locked boxes located centrally in
 each village. PSI provided monthly supervision to verify
 data in CBDA registers, collect used kits and restock
 supplies. CBDAs were remunerated for each kit distrib-
 uted (MWK100/US$0.15) and each kit distributed with
 linkage to HIV care (MWK150/USD$0.23).
 The SOC in both arms included HIV testing and ART
 services under the Ministry of Health, offered primarily
 at health facilities. Standard HIV testing used blood-­
 based rapid diagnostic testing algorithms, with ART initi-
 ated immediately following a confirmed HIV diagnosis.
 
<section> Outcomes and measurement
 The primary outcome compared between arms the
 proportion of individuals aged 16 years and older who
 self-­ reported recent testing for HIV (in the last
 months), measured at cluster level using an endline
 survey. Secondary outcomes compared (1) self-­reported
 lifetime HIV testing, and (2) cumulative 16-­month inci-
 dence of ART initiations per 100 000 population, which
 was ascertained using ART clinic records during the
 intervention period.
 HIV testing outcomes were measured through a cross-­
 sectional survey administered at the end of the interven-
 tion period. In each evaluation area, two villages with a
 minimum of 250 residents aged 16 years and older were
 randomly selected, with one village surveyed at endline
 and one village surveyed at baseline. The baseline survey
 was conducted prior to the intervention to adjust for
 imbalance between arms in the primary outcome.
 Households in the evaluation villages were enumerated
 and randomly selected to provide a sample of at least
 participants per village. All individuals aged 16 years and
 older in selected households were eligible for the survey,
 with multiple visits for interviews attempted to maximise
 the response rate. Informed verbal consent or assent was
 obtained. Participants were then interviewed on house-
 hold and sociodemographic characteristics and prior use
 of HIV testing, treatment and prevention services.
 ART initiation data were extracted from registers at
 each of the health facilities for the 16-­month interven-
 tion period and the 12-­ month period preceding the
 intervention. Eligibility criteria included ART patients
 aged 16 years and older from the evaluation area. Popu-
 lation estimates for the evaluation area, which were used
 as the denominator for the ART outcome, were obtained
 from facility and village registers.
 The proportion of lifetime HIVST use and the
 number of HIVST kits distributed were evaluated using
 the endline survey and CBDA registers. Adverse events
 related to HIVST were also measured using the endline
 survey in addition to a community reporting system
 established in evaluation villages to identify and manage
 potential adverse events. 17 Community stakeholders,
 including village heads, community health workers, reli-
 gious leaders and police officers, documented, investi-
 gated and managed social harms related to HIV testing
 and self-­testing. Adverse events were reported to the study
 team and assessed, categorised by severity and followed
 up as appropriate.
 
<section> Sample size
 
<section> With 11 clusters per arm and 250 participants per cluster,
 we had at least 80% power at a 5% significance level to
 detect a 30% relative increase in the primary outcome of
 recent HIV testing in the HIVST arm, assuming 25%–40%
 coverage in the SOC arm. 18 The study was also powered
 to identify a 45% relative increase in lifetime HIV testing
 in the HIVST arm, assuming 42%–60% coverage in the
 SOC arm. The sample size was calculated using a coeffi-
 cient of variation (k) in clusters of 0.25.
 
<section> Statistical analysis
 We conducted an intention-­ to-­ treat analysis based on
 cluster assignment to study arms and used methods appro-
 priate for cluster randomised trials. 15 The risk difference
 (RD) and risk ratio were calculated respectively from
 cluster-­level risks and log risks, which were compared by
 arm using a t-­test. For HIV testing outcomes, we adjusted
 for imbalances in individual-­level covariates based on a
 two-­stage approach. 15 The first stage used logistic regres-
 sion with individual-­level covariates to obtain predicted
 values, which were summed at the cluster level and
 applied to calculate the difference and ratio of observed
 and predicted values. The second stage used linear
 regression of covariate-­adjusted residuals obtained from
 the first stage and included the study arm. To adjust for
 imbalance in the primary outcome prior to the interven-
 tion, the cluster-­level baseline covariate of recent HIV
 testing was also included in the regression model. The
 ART initiation outcome adjusted for ART uptake in the
 12-­month preintervention period. 
<section> Figure 2 Trial flow diagram. Flow diagram of the cluster randomised
 For recent HIV testing, a priori subgroup analyses were
 specified by sex, age group (16–19 years, 20 years and
 older) and socioeconomic status (lowest, middle, highest
 strata). Post hoc analysis used alternative categories of
 age group (16–19 years, 20–39 years, 40 years and older).
 Further, subgroup analyses were conducted for lifetime
 HIV testing by sex, age group and socioeconomic status,
 and for ART initiations by intervention period (0–5, 6–11,
 12–16 months). Statistical analysis used Stata V.14.0.
 
<section> RESULTS
 
<section> Implementation of the intervention was staggered,
 starting from September to December 2016, and contin-
 uing until January 2018. Overall, 203 CBDAs (cluster
 mean 18.5) distributed 273 729 HIVST kits (cluster mean
 24 884.45) throughout the catchment area of health
 facilities, including evaluation and non-­evaluation areas
 (online supplemental table 1). The volume of kits distrib-
 uted was similar by sex, with 50.2% (n=137 433) of kits
 delivered to men.
 The population in the evaluation area included
 390 residents in 11 clusters in the HIVST arm and 51
 488 residents in 11 clusters in the SOC arm. Partici-
 pants were recruited for the endline survey between
 October 2017 and January 2018. The trial flow diagram is
 reported in figure 2. The endline survey included 77.0%
 (2582/3355) of enumerated residents in the HIVST arm
 and 78.6% (2908/3699) of enumerated residents in the
 SOC arm, with few eligible residents refusing to partici-
 pate (10/7054).

<section> Population characteristics for the endline survey are
 summarised in table 1. The proportion of men was 42.6%
 (2339/5490) and the median age was 31 years old. The
 majority of participants did not have beyond primary-­
 level education (84.9%, 4661/5490). Most characteristics
 were well balanced by arm. Differences were observed for
 marital status, with 69.5% (1795/2582) married in the
 HIVST arm and 63.2% (1838/2908) married in the SOC
 arm.
 The baseline survey was administered between May and
 August 2016. Of listed individuals, 78.5% (2809/3577)
 and 74.7% (2664/3567) were surveyed in the HIVST and
 SOC arms, respectively (online supplemental tables 2 and
 3). Baseline coverage of HIV testing in the last 12 months
 was higher in the HIVST arm (56.0%, 1574/2809) than
 the SOC arm (48.4%, 1289/2664; table 1). We therefore
 adjusted for baseline differences in analysis of primary
 and secondary outcomes. Self-­reported lifetime use of
 HIVST at baseline was limited (7/5473).
 
<section> Primary outcome
 At endline, recent HIV testing (in the last 12 months) was
 higher in the HIVST arm (68.5%, 1768/2582) compared
 with the SOC arm (48.9%, 1422/2908), with adjusted RD
 of 16.1% (95% CI 6.5% to 25.7%; table 2; online supple-
 mental figure 1). In subgroup analysis, the intervention
 had a more pronounced effect among adolescents aged
 16–19 years (adjusted RD 26.1%, 95% CI 12.9% to 39.2%)
 than adults aged 20 years and older (adjusted RD 14.7%,
 95% CI 4.8% to 24.6%), though data were consistent with
 no interaction effect (p value for interaction=0.18). Post

 hoc analysis found similar differences among adults aged
 20–39 years and adults 40 years and older (online supple-
 mental table 4). While the difference in the proportion
 of recent testing was also higher for men (adjusted RD
 20.6%, 95% CI 7.1% to 34.0%) compared with women
 (adjusted RD 12.8%, 95% CI 4.0% to 21.6%), there
 was weak evidence for interaction (p=0.07). In terms of
 socioeconomic status, the effect of the intervention was
 greater among participants in the highest strata (adjusted
 RD 20.2%, 95% CI 8.3% to 32.1%) than the lowest strata
 (adjusted RD 13.0%, 95% CI 1.1% to 24.8%). However,
 there was no evidence for interaction (highest vs lowest
 strata: p value for interaction=0.18).
 
<section> Secondary outcomes
 Lifetime HIV testing was higher in the HIVST arm (86.9%,
 2243/2582) than the SOC arm (78.5%, 2283/2908;
 adjusted RD 6.3%, 95% CI 2.3% to 10.3%; table 2; online
 supplemental figure 1). In exploratory analysis, the effect
 of the intervention was larger for adolescents aged 16–19
 years (adjusted RD 18.6%, 95% CI 7.3% to 29.9%) than
 adults aged 20 years and older (adjusted RD 4.4%, 95%
 CI 0.5% to 8.2%; p value for interaction=0.02), and for
 men (adjusted RD 10.2%, 95% CI 3.1% to 17.2%) than
 women (adjusted RD 3.4%, 95% CI −0.9% to 7.7%; p
 value for interaction=0.07; online supplemental table 4).
 The intervention effect on lifetime testing was similar in
 the lowest and highest socioeconomic strata and close to
 zero for the middle strata.
 Cumulative incidence of ART initiation captured at
 health facilities during the 16-­month intervention period
 was 1187.2 and 909.0 per 100 000 population in the
 HIVST and SOC arms, respectively (adjusted RD 309.1,
 95% CI −95.5 to 713.7; table 2; online supplemental
 figure 1). Stratified by time period since study initia-
 tion, the adjusted RD for periods of 0–5, 6–11 and 12–16
 months was 142.6 (95% CI −81.5 to 366.7), 194.8 (95%
 CI 31.4 to 358.1) and 28.3 (95% CI −186.5 to 129.9),
 respectively. There was no evidence for statistical differ-
 ences measured (6–11 months vs 0–5 months: p value for
 interaction=0.51; 12–16 months vs 0–5 months: p value
 for interaction=0.42; online supplemental table 4).
 
<section> Process outcomes
 Consistent with the high number of HIVST kits distrib-
 uted, there were large differences between arms in
 awareness and use of HIVST at endline. The propor-
 tion of participants who had heard of HIVST at endline
 was 88.8% (2294/2582) in the HIVST arm and 31.5%
 (917/2908) in the SOC arm (table 3). Self-­reported life-
 time HIVST use was respectively 42.5% (1097/2582) in
 the HIVST arm, with uptake highest in young men aged
 20–24 years (58%) and adolescent boys (49.0%; online
 supplemental figure 2). Similar coverage was reported
 for HIVST use in the last 12 months. HIVST use was 8.3%
 (240/2908) in the SOC arm, with one cluster exposed
 to an external community-­ based HIVST programme
 in 2017. Among participants who recently self-­ tested
 in the HIVST arm (n=794), most received HIVST kits
 from the CBDA (97.9%, n=777) and collected their kits
 at home (76.7%, n=609). Further, 0.8% (n=6) reported
 a new HIV-­positive result and 2.0% (n=16) reported a

<section> Safety outcomes
 At endline, 0.5% (4/794) of participants reported being
 forced to self-­test or disclose their self-­test results (table 3).
 Three events of social harm related to HIVST were
 reported, managed and resolved through the community
 reporting system: one case involved discrimination from
 household members for collecting an HIVST kit; two
 cases involved temporary separation between couples,
 with one event from self-­testing and one event due to
 newly identified serodiscordancy within the couple. In
 an additional event reported to implementers in non-­
 evaluation areas, a perinatally infected adolescent under
 the eligible age acquired an HIVST kit and suffered a
 highly stigmatising response following self-­testing with
 her friends. These events have been described in detail
 elsewhere.
 
<section> DISCUSSION
 
<section> The main findings from this cluster randomised trial were
 that door-­to-­door distribution of HIVST kits by CBDAs
 increased recent and lifetime HIV testing at population
 level in rural Malawi. Our primary outcome of recent
 testing increased by 16.1%. Lifetime testing increased by
 6.3%, with differences between arms most pronounced
 among priority subgroups: adolescents aged 16–19 years
 and men. The HIVST intervention did not show an effect
 on cumulative incidence of ART initiations at health
 facilities for the overall 16-­month intervention period.
 HIVST use was reported by 42.5% of participants in the
 HIVST arm, with uptake highest among young men aged
 20–24 years and adolescent boys. Few serious adverse
 events were reported. Our results therefore support
 door-­to-­door HIVST as an effective and safe strategy that
 can be used to meet HIV testing needs in underserved
 rural populations.
 Our study is one of three community-­based randomised
 trials from rural settings in southern Africa that were
 implemented as part of STAR. 14 19 20 Affordable, conve-
 nient and safe HIV testing strategies are important for
 rural populations, who often have more pronounced
 barriers to accessing healthcare. 13 The STAR trials had
 critical differences that can be used to guide policy and
 future research priorities. Our results showed increased
 recent and lifetime HIV testing from door-­ to-­ door
 HIVST, consistent with a separate Zambian trial, which
 added HIVST to an intensive community-­ based HIV
 programme. 12 High coverage of lifetime testing (88.7%)
 and lifetime HIVST use (50.2%) was reported for both
 arms of the STAR Zimbabwe trial, which compared the
 impact of remuneration strategies under campaign-­style
 distribution by CBDAs on linkage to HIV care. 19 Our
 study, along with the Zimbabwe trial, implemented door-­
 to-­ door distribution. In contrast, provision of HIVST
 kits at home, high-­density community sites and health
 facilities under the STAR Zambia trial resulted in lower
 HIVST use (26.3%) and no measurable increase in life-
 time or recent testing. 20 Process outcomes, such as HIVST
 awareness, were also lower in Zambia than in Malawi and
 Zimbabwe, suggesting that door-­to-­door distribution can
 lead to higher penetration than broader community-­
 based models. 19
 We showed encouraging uptake of HIVST, with minimal
 social harms reported. Uptake was highest among young
 men aged 20–24 years followed by adolescent boys aged
 16–19 years. Our study also reported increased lifetime
 HIV testing among adolescents and men. HIVST can
 bypass barriers that prevent uptake of standard HTS by
 these priority subgroups, 10 21 with HIVST valued for the
 convenience and confidentiality afforded. 5 22 However,
 our results demonstrated lower uptake compared with
 the STAR Zimbabwe trial, which evaluated more inten-
 sive distribution across a shorter period of time. 19 Simi-
 larly, a previous study in urban Malawi reported 84%
 uptake from distribution of HIVST kits by community
 volunteers, which may indicate higher acceptability 
<section> among urban counterparts. 10 Understanding remaining
 demand-­ side barriers may allow for further optimisa-
 tion of community-­based HIVST strategies to maximise
 coverage and impact among underserved subgroups.
 Alternative HIVST strategies should also be considered.
 In Malawi, facility-­based provision of HIVST kits among
 outpatients increased coverage of HIV testing, especially
 among adolescents. 23 Another study in Malawi found
 that secondary distribution to male partners of pregnant
 women extended testing coverage.
 Our study did not observe an increase in ART initia-
 tions for the overall 16-­month intervention period but
 in subgroup analysis for the 6–11 months’ postinterven-
 tion period. Further, 0.8% of participants reported a new
 positive result from HIVST, with frequent repeat testing
 among participants already known to be HIV positive.
 Impact on ART uptake varied across STAR trials. 24 A non-­
 randomised evaluation accompanying the Zimbabwe
 trial estimated a 27% increase in ART initiation rates,
 while no difference was observed in Zambia. 20 Linkage to
 HIV care is practically difficult to capture, with potential
 for measurement errors. 24 True impact on ART demand
 from HIVST will depend on the prevalence of untreated
 HIV, which has been declining in southern and eastern
 Africa. 2 The intensity and reach of HIVST distribution
 strategies will also influence population-­ level impact.
 Additionally, interventions to encourage timely linkage
 to health facilities may be required, such as provision
 of home-­based HIV care or more substantial financial
 incentives. 11
 The benefits of community-­based HTS are well estab-
 lished, with the main barrier to implementation including
 high cost per test and cost per new diagnosis, especially as
 countries reach the ‘First 90’ targets. 25 Economic analysis
 of our intervention is reported separately. 26 CBDA distri-
 bution showed average cost of 2017 US$8.15 per HIVST
 kit distributed, with the main cost contributors including
 personnel and HIVST kits. 26 Unit cost of community-­
 based HIVST was higher than the average cost of facility-­
 based HTS (2016 US$4.92) and facility-­ based HIVST
 (US$4.99) in Malawi. 23 27 While community-­based HIVST
 is likely to maintain higher levels of knowledge of recent
 HIV status than standard HTS alone, sustainable provi-
 sion will require further reductions in costs and optimi-
 sation of linkage to HIV treatment and prevention. For
 example, providing periodic campaigns is likely to be
 less costly than maintaining a continuous programme,
 especially if targeted to high-­prevalence populations or
 underserved subgroups with ongoing HIV risk. Alterna-
 tively, a community-­led approach for delivering HIVST
 has potential to further reduce costs.
 The main strength of this study is the use of a robust
 cluster randomised design to report on the effectiveness
 and safety of large-­scale implementation of community-­
 based HIVST. Further, CBDAs are commonly used to
 distribute health commodities in Malawi, with our find-
 ings potentially generalisable to settings in sub-­Saharan
 Africa with similar community health cadres. We also
 add to the body of evidence on effective strategies for
 expanding HIV testing coverage in rural, HIV-­prevalent
 populations and among population subgroups with
 substantial undiagnosed HIV.
 Limitations included HIV testing outcomes that were
 self-­reported and therefore susceptible to misreporting.
 ART initiations may be underestimated if study residents
 accessed non-­study health facilities, which we aimed to
 minimise with our inclusion criteria of health facilities.
 Non-­participation in the endline survey could result in
 ascertainment bias, with response rates lower among
 men than women. We did not account for household-­
 level clustering, though this was unlikely to have altered
 our findings. 29 We discontinued second randomisation of
 home-­based HIV care in the HIVST arm; however, the
 outcomes reported in this study were not affected. Data
 on social harms were passively collected through commu-
 nity reporting systems, potentially under-­ reporting
 the number of adverse events. Finally, our findings are
 limited to our intervention design, which included door-­
 to-­door implementation through remunerated CBDAs.
 
<section> CONCLUSION
 Door-­ to-­ door distribution of HIVST kits by CBDAs
 increased recent and lifetime HIV testing in rural, under-
 served populations, including among adolescents 16–19
 years and men. ART initiations showed no differences
 between arms for the overall 16-­ month intervention
 period. HIVST was very acceptable and safe, with uptake
 highest among young men and adolescent boys. Door-­
 to-­ door HIVST demonstrates significant potential to
 contribute to HIV elimination goals in priority settings.
 Further, as countries approach the ‘First 90’ targets, this
 approach could be adapted for periodic implementation
 to meet the ongoing need for HTS in settings with high
 undiagnosed HIV.
